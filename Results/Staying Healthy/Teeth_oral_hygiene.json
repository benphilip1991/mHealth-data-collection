            "My daughter loves this app because she loves trying to get the stars to decorate her 5 rooms. Well, she's earned enough to get every single item in each room, and currently has 81 stars. She is anxious to have more rooms or decorations. I emailed you guys ages ago asking if/when you would be updating, and never received a response. She's been asking me daily for three weeks if I've heard from Budd. I'm giving you only two stars for the lack of response.",
            "All 3 of my kids' accounts are glitching: not giving all stars, not opening new rooms when first 2 are complete, and not even letting my daughter login at all. But brushing and attitude have improved even in the incredibly short time the app worked.",
            "Edit: Seems the devs fixed it Good app but not supported anymore it seems. Email support never answers back so you're stuck. In my case I want to transfer the app to another identical phone (1st one broke). But it doesn't work. I'm even on the paid subscription!!! Otherwise it's a well designed app for kids - mine LOVES it. Annoying to adults but we're not the audience here. The video recording & playback, quizzes, AR, etc.are well thought out and implemented. I just wish they still had support.",
            "My son really enjoys this app. It makes him slow down & pay attention to where & how he's brushing. My son can watch how he's brushing and compare to the character. The app takes pics during the brushing process. After brushing is done the child matches his/her pic with the character. If matched correctly, points are earned to \"purchase\" decorations for their bathroom w/ in the game. My only negative opinion would be not having the child brush their tongue. I REALLY wish they would add that.",
            "A game that teaches good brushing techniques AND rewards a child's efforts! I tried every toothbrushing game out there, and this is the only one that teaches to brush all parts of the teeth and lasts at least the 2 minute recommended brushing time. It's fun and gives rewards at the end. Almost perfect. It needs to include brushing the tongue. It also needs to spend more time on the biting surfaces, as those are the most important to brush."

The Dentacare Mobile app aims to form long-lasting dental care habits through an intensive training program in an engaging gamified environment.\r\n\r\nResearch by the Australian Dental Association shows us that nowadays, more than 90% of all dental problems can be prevented with regular check-ups, proper oral care and nutrition. This well-known but often missed real-world problem is about to meet its match by facing the new mobile app from Dentacoin. \r\n\r\nThrough reminders, notifications, voice navigation and tutorials, you will be taught how to improve your dental hygiene and thus, form healthy dental care habits. The app educates you on how to brush, floss and rinse properly, but also provides further recommendations on how to properly take care of your teeth, by means of regular check-ups, better nutrition and so on. \r\nFurthermore the implemented emergency function allows you to get advice from dental specialists within the Dentacoin network, should you be unable to consult your dentist on time. The app is tremendously beneficial for children as well, as forming dental hygiene habits at a young age prevents serious complications in the future.\r\n\r\nThe basic program lasts 3 months, as science shows us that this is how much time people need to permanently develop a habit. Once you’ve finished training consistently for three months, you are free to withdraw your hard-earned Dentacoin and exchange it for dental services, dental care products, Dentacoin Assurance, or simply trade it on exchange platforms against other currencies.

Here are my suggestions/wishes:  More pictures; for example, the mandibular condylar hyperplasia, fractured and avulsed teeth, and burning mouth syndrome etc. Thanks for the many many awesome pics already there.

            "This app was kinda cool at first, but then it started saying I was missing spots. I could scrub the \"missed\" area forever, and it would show me brushing the opposite side of my mouth. Today it refused to connect to my brush. I checked and double checked the brush Bluetooth setting, and it was fine. Let's face it, a phone app for a toothbrush is of marginal use anyway. If it doesn't work, it's definitely not worth trying to fix.",
            "Connecting to the brush is awful. It took 20 minutes of off/on, off/on to finally get the first connection. During this time, the brush was always showing as an available device in the phone's own Bluetooth setting (this was to test to make sure that Bluetooth could see it, I wasn't trying to connect via it). So, the issue is in the app. Why not have the brush use the phone's bluetooth function, which works? Anyway, I got it connected and the next morning? Brush couldn't be found. My daily routine isn't going to include 20 minutes morning and night fighting with an app that won't connect to the brush.",
            "Good idea, very bad execution. Seems half-baked and not thought out. The app is supposed to track your flossing and rinsing, but there's no way to input this information. It doesn't ask you, there's nowhere to enter it. Makes it pretty difficult to track. Some sessions are saved, others aren't. If you tap the screen, your session will be cleared and won't save, which was a baffling choice by the developer.",
            "Either the toothbrush is not saving brushing data, or the app is unable to download saved data. It works fine if I start a brushing via the app, but most of the time I'm not going to go get my phone just to brush my teeth, but I would like to download the data from time to time to see how it's going. Right, now, I can't do that (it is not a bluetooth connection problem). I have Series 9 IO brush and Pixel 3 phone.",
            "Serious connectivity issues within the app to the brush. I just got my brand new brush a smart 4000. So this is a disappointment as you are buying it for the app connectivity etc. If it's a phone compatibility issue it should be mentioned on the box that compatibility is limited. As it is, it is not mentioned. Expected more from oral-b to be honest. As it stands the product is not fit for purpose."

I like the option to brush your tongue, and the tips for flossing, as well as the reminder to rinse. Great job developer!",
            "My kids and I love this app. Thanks to it we developed great toothbrushing habits. And it is actually a lot less boring to use the app than to just brush your teeth on your own, so much easier, it tells you which section to start with and when to move to the next section so you don't have to keep track of which section to brush or for how long, you just have to make sure you are covering that section well and that's it. Time goes by faster and you do a much better job and your dentist loves you.",
            "I really liked the actually walk through but the timer was inaccurate. I set the first timer for 7 and the second d for 9:00 and it ended up ringing at 9:53 the next day? so then I tried switch them, but it ended up ring around 8. it's a nice app, but the timer makes it to where I can't use it.",
            "This app is great! It gave me 2options on how to brush my teeth. My mom asked me to get a toothbrush app because i brush my teeth for 30 sec. Anyway i love this app it even gives you a tip on how to keep your teeth healthy!!!!",

        "description": "HOW TO WHITEN YOUR TEETH, PREVENT BAD BREATH, TARTAR AND PLAQUE\r\n\r\nIt is really easy to keep your mouth healthy and your teeth white. You need to add some of these tips into your daily routine.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer coconut oil, take a tablespoon of coconut oil and put it in your mouth. Swish it around for 15-20 minutes. Then, brush teeth as you normally do.\r\n\r\nBesides coconut oil pulling, we offer you several other tricks you can do at home and make your teeth whiter.\r\n\r\nThis is how you can whiten your teeth from home using ingredients that you can find in your pantry. All these recipes are very simple and very effective.\r\n\r\nThe first trick includes strawberries and baking soda. Crush the strawberries and mix them with a teaspoon of baking soda. Dab your toothbrush into the mixture and brush your teeth with it.\r\n\r\nYou should not do this more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nThe second trick includes apple cider vinegar and baking soda. Mix these two ingredients until you get a consistency like toothpaste. Apply it on your toothbrush and scrub away. Don’t do it too regularly because soda is acidic and can wear out the tooth enamel if you do it more than 1-2 a week.\r\n\r\nThe third trick is an olive oil mouth rinse. Fill your mouth with olive oil and swirl it around and around. It is not acidic and this treatment can be done every day. If you don’t like the taste of olive oil in your mouth, there is another option. Soak a cotton pad into the olive oil and rub it along your teeth.\r\n\r\nThe fourth trick is rubbing teeth with the inside of a banana peel. It is really effective so give it a try.\r\n\r\nThe fifth trick is similar with the previous one and includes rubbing your teeth with the inside of an orange or lemon peel.\r\n\r\nThe sixth trick is adding a pinch of table salt on your toothpaste before brushing teeth. Doing this every day really helps whiten your teeth.\r\n\r\nThe seventh tip is eating apple every day because they really clean your teeth. It is definitely a good option.\r\n\r\nThe tip number eight is to use milk in your coffee and tea. The reason for that is not just the calcium in milk, but also it reduces the capacity of coffee and tea to stain your teeth. It is a good thing to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nTip number nine is to decrease the intake of caffeinated things, such as tea and coffee, but also energy drinks because they include lots of sugar and caffeine and are bad for you in so many ways.",

But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. \r\nWe present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). \r\nIn this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets.\r\n \r\nYou have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful.\r\n \r\nDeveloping games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child.

As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",

            "It's great the annoying thing is that you need a premium access to your spotify to listen to music (I cant afford premium access) if you could change this that'll be lovely!!!",
            "My daughter has been using this app for a while when she out grew the more kiddy ones. We download some songs from our librarie's fregal subscription. However they cancelled the subscription and we got bored with our selections, so I finally upgraded my Spotify subscription. However I can only seem to open one playlist to use? I don't get a choice. Am I doing something wrong? Is this normal? We also can't pick a specific song? I'm not as concerned about that though.",
            "I loved the app the couple times I've used it. The way the timer works is wonderful and so is being able to play my own music. However the big reason I downloaded this app is because I struggle to remember to brush my teeth and I wanted the notification to remind me. I turned the notification on and made sure I could get notifications from the app in my phone settings as well but I do not get the notifications unless I remember to open the app at the times I set it for.",
            "Great app for teenagers! My 13 and 15 yo will actually use it bc it's not an app for little kids, so it's wonderful!! They like the music options too. Suggestion for future: I'd really like it if I could see the days I brush on a calendar. Then even get my whole family involved, and have a healthy competition going with the kids on who brushed more that week! But I know you're actively working on it and so far so good. Keep it up!",
            "Great! I've never been more consistent about brushing my teeth. The only suggestion is notifications should have varying levels of annoyance if you need more motivation! Like one that is more of an alarm than a reminder. It would also be nice to access another music app like pandora or YouTube music if you don't have Spotify premium. But otherwise, great app and great concept. I love the ragtime song :) Thank you!!"

            "Great app, our daughter loves it and uses it morning and night. BUT the song needs to go a bit longer in my opinion as my daughter tends to stop brushing during the countdown to spitting out the toothpaste so she's not actually brushing for the whole 2 minutes. Also we've gotten to the end sticker and while the app keeps working we just get the Emma sticker over and over now. My daughter is still happy to keep using it but maybe it would be good if it just goes back to the start of the stickers",
            "This app does not need to know my location. It does not need to make phone calls. It does not need access to files on my phone. Two stars less for that. Also it takes ages focusing on spitting out rather than brushing. More video of brushing would be good as a learning aid. It would be nice to have the option to run it for more than two minutes since it wastes time with the spitting and my daughter likes to have a go leaving me with only one minute left to do it properly, but of course my solution for that is end and restart after one verse. It's free which is great.",
            "My kids love the song and I think it's great. The only issue is that it closes (like the phone falls asleep), and then it starts over, but then the second time it works the whole way through. Still like it though.",
            "Can I make a suggestion... Have the video unable to be paused. My son likes holding my phone while I brush his teeth for him at 18 months. Every finger he presses on the screen pauses it. Can you make it so it can't be paused? Also all the permissions are unnecessary. Other than that my son brushes his teeth really well now.

        "description": "■Description:\r\nWith more than 27,000 downloads, this oral hygiene app was created by a practicing dentist who wanted to help his high school-age daughter get through life without cavities and periodontal disease.\r\nTooth-brushing time can be set to as little as 2+ minutes. But to avoid missed spots, it is recommended that the user start out by brushing their teeth along with the app and stick with the initial setting of 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n■What this app can do:\r\n1. Anyone (children, family members, or even yourself) who saw tooth-brushing as something of a hassle before will have a more proactive attitude toward oral hygiene.\r\n2. As users continue brushing toward their savings goal, they will pick up good brushing habits naturally.\r\n3. The once-monotonous act of daily brushing will feel like a game, helping the user keep brushing without losing interest.\r\n4. For adults, too, the app helps users avoid missed spots, and helps prevent hypersensitivity that can be caused with typical side-to-side brushing.\r\n5. By keeping the mouth clean, the user is more protected from cold and influenza viruses, which often enter through the mouth.\r\n\r\n■Features that set this app apart:\r\nIn this app, the brushing technique is based on up-and-down strokes. This is what many dentists recommend, because with up-and-down strokes, the user is less likely to miss spots or have hypersensitivity issues than with typical side-to-side brushing.\r\nWith realistic 3D images and spoken instructions, the app guides the user through the brushing process to help ensure that all areas of the teeth get good and clean.\r\nThe app also offers instruction on the use of dental floss and mouthwash, helping the user keep their mouth nice and clean.\r\n\r\n■A new concept! Building savings by tooth-brushing:\r\nMany people are too busy or just can't be bothered to practice good brushing habits. The \"savings\" part of \"Tooth-brushing savings\" is like a virtual bank that lets users grow their accounts by brushing every day. The idea is to encourage people to take a more proactive attitude toward oral hygiene.\r\nAdults can reward children for continuing to brush with the app for a certain period without skipping. The reward can be set at the beginning, and can be in the form of actual money or other item. (The app can also be used as just a tooth-brushing tool, without the savings function.)\r\nThe app is also designed to encourage users to use it every day. By reaching a certain number of days without skipping, the user can unlock special Gold and Silver tooth-brushing items. These items can also be used on the actual tooth-brushing screens. This can help make tooth-brushing more fun over the long term. With this latest version of the app, the user can compare their \"days without skipping\" score with family members or virtual friends, and get new designs for their virtual toothbrush each season by keeping up with their brushing for 60 days without skipping.\r\nThese new features are designed to give users a greater sense of accomplishment, make tooth-brushing more like a game, and make users feel even more motivated to keep their teeth clean.\r\n\r\n■Creator comments:\r\nOur \"Tooth-brushing savings\" app was released two years ago. The app has been well-received, and downloaded by more than 27,000 users.\r\nMany dental clinics now recommend the app not only to their child patients but adults as well, as a way to encourage proper brushing every day.\r\nA great many users have let us know what they think of the app since its initial launch. We've used their feedback to make the app even better for its latest release. We've added features designed to make the practice of tooth-brushing more fun, and an English version is now available. The app has undergone a major revamp aimed at giving users—not only in Japan, but around the world—greater motivation to develop good brushing habits.",

            "I don't think it's good idea that you allow the tooth to come up with a speech bubble advertising random apps with an install button, a young child may click on it not realising what the app is etc and end up playing or using an app that they are not supposed to be on! Because they think that maybe the tooth is asking them to install the ad app. And a young child would most likely do this especially if they don't understand what it is etc. So you need to remove this feature."

Furthermore, features like treatment plan, allergies and drugs taken allow me to be prepared for every patient before they step into the clinic. Thank you MDC team!",

            "Oh gosh!badest game ever i didnt seen in my life you know what there are just 6 levels and such a horrible zonbie and ads too much ....if there is 0 star so i will gave this game such a hippo",
            "Ok, so first off, I'll be completely clear.. the only purpose of this app is to waste your time. First off, the storyline isnt really great, and nothing is explained that well. Second, you have to watch around 4-6 ads every single level just to progress without spending 5.00. This brings me to my third point: it isnt worth a cent of your money. You do the same boring process in each level all the way until level 6( the last level). Also, you dont get your end-of-level prizes. 0 stars, dont try.",
            "It's does not work can you tell us why it is not working",
            "it is a horrible game there are only 6 levels and 4-5 ads evry level and you have to watch the ad to complete the level you can finish the whole game in one day I do not recommend I have already finished the game it is horrible do not download this!😡and the is one level that has a zombie and then after you see the zombie it ends you can't do anything it just ends😤"

I love how you get all the different patients and then you get the stickers from them! The one bad thing is that you need Wi-Fi to watch a video instead of playing the mini games. The mini games are also too hard. What if you don't want to play a mini game! Then you can't pass that level. But mostly, this game is amazing😁",

        "description": "A Look At Flossing\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with brushing your teeth, you should also be flossing on a daily basis. Flossing will remove plaque and debris in areas that your toothbrush isn’t able to reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA buildup of plaque can lead to gum disease or tooth decay, which is why flossing is very important. If you floss immediately after brushing, you’ll notice that your gums and teeth will be much healthier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you look at dental floss, you’ll notice there are two types – nylon and single filament. You can get nylon either waxed or un-waxed, in several different flavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNylon floss is made up of several strands of nylon material, meaning that it can shred, tear, or snag between the teeth if it gets caught on sharp teeth. Even though the single filament floss is more expensive than nylon, it will slide easily between teeth, even tight areas and spaces. Unlike nylon, single filament is impossible to shred or tear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter which type of floss you choose, as long you floss regularly, it will remove debris from your teeth and gums. If you’ve never tried flossing before, you will probably be amazed at just how much debris and food particles it can remove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlossing is recommended by dentists everywhere, as it can reach places that even the smallest of toothbrushes can’t. Food and debris will build up between your teeth, which makes dental flossing very important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main problem many people have against flossing is the fact that it can result in bleeding of the gums. Anytime you floss and get between your teeth and around your gums, the floss will rub against your gums, resulting in bleeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people take this the wrong way, and immediately stop flossing, usually for good. Bleeding is very common, and should be expected with flossing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you brush your teeth, you miss a lot of food particles and debris that continues to build up in your mouth. No toothbrush is designed to get every area of your mouth, as all of them miss hard to reach places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the areas missed by the toothbrush, the debris and plaque will continue to build up until they eventually result in a cavity or decay. To get this debris and plaque before it builds up into something more serious, you’ll need to floss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been afraid to try flossing due to the bleeding, you should really get over that fear and floss after you brush. To keep your teeth and gums healthy, you’ll to brush and floss your teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegular checkups with your dentist will help as well, although it is up to you to continue your regular maintenance at home with flossing and brushing. If you floss on a daily basis – you’ll quickly realize just how clean your teeth and gums will be.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll About Cavities\r\n\r\n\r\nCavities can best be described as tooth decay. As we all know, tooth decay is influenced by what we eat, how we take care of our teeth, and the amount of fluoride in our toothpastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your family has a history of tooth disease or teeth problems, then you may inherit it that way. This is very common, as many people inherit tooth problems that have been passed down from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdults who suffer from a dry mouth are more at risk for cavities, as they have a lack of saliva in their mouth. Dry mouth is very common, and is normally the result of medications, illness, and radiation treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTobacco users will also suffer from dry mouth, as the tobacco will use up the saliva in the mouth and leave the user with nothing to keep his or her mouth moist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCavities are a very serious situation, and if left untreated, can result in the destruction of the tooth. This can also destroy the nerves as well, resulting in an abscess.",

            "this was honestly one of the most painful games to play. it felt like i was playinf a video game from the early 90's the texhnology seemed so poor. i feel like it had the potential to be a fun simulator game but there were unnecessary things like walking them to rooms with an awkward joy stick type navigator. Also the conversation is awkward and not realistic... felt very... stilted and almost like choppy. definitely needs improvements graphics and content wise. best of luck!",
            "The grammar in this game is atrocious. It is very difficult to walk and the actual gameplay in not brilliant either. This needs many changes to make this game 5 stars. An update is essential, or this game will never become any better. Some people might think I am being a bit harsh with a one star review, but this game seriously needs help. If the developer is looking at this, please, please change the graphics and controls! It looks completely different to the pictures, which is clickbait.thanks"

My son has been on the same one for two days and it only awarded him one star. I tried emailing about this problem with the email address provided in the description, but it bounced back as incorrect.",
            "I contemplate deleting this all all the time. My kid likes the accessories, scrolling through characters, the funny routine of \"beating up\" the bad germ, the different voices. I like switching between English and Korean (both are acted out nicely). I dislike granting the location permissions. I don't like how 1-2 teeth are placed out of order in one section. My kid gets bored & opts out of using it. I'm still keeping it. Where can I buy this toothbrush in Seoul? 이 칫솔은 한국에서 어디에서 팔아요?"

        "description": "United Concordia Dental is proud to present Chomper Chums®, a dental hygiene focused mobile app.  The app is designed to enable parents to help their child to learn proper brushing techniques and to establish long lasting and healthy oral wellness habits.  The target audience includes children between the ages of 4 and 11 years of age. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the app is to help children to develop good oral wellness habits at an early age that will last a lifetime. These include brushing for the recommended time period of two minutes, twice per day, as well as flossing and rinsing.  To engage children while they brush and learn, the app introduces three fun, friendly and lovable animal characters that are named by the child, and with whom they interact each time they brush.  Characters include a lion, horse and alligator – all of whom help the child to learn how to brush properly. \r\n\r\nUsing colorful animation, the app also helps children to make sure that they reach all quadrants of their mouths when brushing by showing the inside of their animal character’s mouth while they brush. The child can chase “sugar bugs” around each quadrant, for 30 seconds per quadrant.  When the child brushes correctly twice per day and for the recommended 2 minute time period, they earn coins that are used to purchase food items to help to care for their animal. \r\n\r\nIn caring for their animal, the child is encouraged to select healthy food items, but can also select less healthy choices to feed their animal, such as snacks rather than vegetables.

Also, children who continue to brush regularly for extended days can earn the “Super Smile Award” which allows them to send their animal character on a new adventure!",
        "descriptionHTML": "United Concordia Dental is proud to present Chomper Chums®, a dental hygiene focused mobile app.  The app is designed to enable parents to help their child to learn proper brushing techniques and to establish long lasting and healthy oral wellness habits.  The target audience includes children between the ages of 4 and 11 years of age. <br><br>The purpose of the app is to help children to develop good oral wellness habits at an early age that will last a lifetime. These include brushing for the recommended time period of two minutes, twice per day, as well as flossing and rinsing.  To engage children while they brush and learn, the app introduces three fun, friendly and lovable animal characters that are named by the child, and with whom they interact each time they brush.  Characters include a lion, horse and alligator – all of whom help the child to learn how to brush properly. <br><br>Using colorful animation, the app also helps children to make sure that they reach all quadrants of their mouths when brushing by showing the inside of their animal character’s mouth while they brush. The child can chase “sugar bugs” around each quadrant, for 30 seconds per quadrant.  When the child brushes correctly twice per day and for the recommended 2 minute time period, they earn coins that are used to purchase food items to help to care for their animal. <br><br>In caring for their animal, the child is encouraged to select healthy food items, but can also select less healthy choices to feed their animal, such as snacks rather than vegetables.  However, the health of their animal character is influenced by their choices, teaching them about the importance of making their own healthy eating choices.  Also, children who continue to brush regularly for extended days can earn the “Super Smile Award” which allows them to send their animal character on a new adventure!",

            "My 7 year old and I enjoy using this app. She loves feeding her animal after she brushes. We wish there were more animals to choose from and the option to pick our own song to play while brushing. Our biggest criticism is that the healthy food costs more money than the junk food. I want to encourage her to eat healthy, but she can't buy as much healthy food and resorts to buying unhealthy snacks for her animal.",
            "Best brushing app for kids We are Sparkly app cutters due to so many issues; so I found this app and it's a huge hit. My 10 and 7yo love to use the app. I love that they included flossing and rinsing as we didn't push flossing before. I am even going to get a character for myself as my brushing routine is horrible to. I agree with other commenters about the healthy food being more expensive(they are kids, just keep it simple; we know in real life more healthy means more expensive).",
            "I have three children using the app and it has help motivate them to brush their teeth - the little one in particular. He built up points every day and announced he'd get to 1000. But after months of working towards this, it clicked over from 999 back to 100. What an anticlimax.",
            "The animation skips the center tooth gap when flossing. Therefore, we can not rate this five star. Some child, somewhere, might skip their center front teeth and get cavities. Thank you. Sincerely, Hannah, age 7 and Hailey, age 5. P.S. We love Chomper Chums though and will raise it to 5 star if you fix this little, but important mistake.",
            "My kid (2.5 years) loves this app. It's kept him asking to brush his teeth for the last two weeks. And it's simple enough that he can mostly navigate it on his own. His little sister also likes dancing to the music while she brushes her teeth"

        "title": "Dental Implants",
        "description": "A dental implant is actually a replacement for the root or roots of a tooth. Like tooth roots, dental implants are secured in the jawbone and are not visible once surgically placed. They are used to secure crowns (the parts of teeth seen in the mouth), bridgework or dentures by a variety of means.

Just like a tooth root, it is placed into the jawbone.\r\n\r\nAre implants safe and how long will they last?\r\nImplants are a safe, well-established treatment. It's probably true to say that implants, much like natural teeth, will last for as long as you care for them.\r\n\r\nHow well you look after your implants - and whether you go for your regular maintenance appointments - will have the biggest impact on how long they will last.\r\n\r\nIf you don't look after your implants they will develop a coating similar to what you get on neglected natural teeth. Left untreated, this can lead to gum infection, bleeding, soreness and general discomfort. You could get all these problems with natural teeth.\r\n\r\nIf your implants are well looked after, and if the bone they are fitted to is strong and healthy, you can expect them to last for many years. However, just as with other surgical implants (such as a hip replacement) there is no lifetime guarantee.\r\n\r\nI have some of my own teeth. Can I still have implants?\r\nYes. You can have any number of teeth replaced with implants - from one single tooth to a complete set.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan implants always be used to replace missing teeth?\r\nIt depends on the condition of the bone in your jaw. Your dentist will arrange for a number of special tests to find out the amount of bone still there. If there is not enough, or if it isn't healthy enough, it may not be possible to place implants without grafting bone into the area first.\"",

It looks like he has all the masks on the first level & isnt moving to the next world. It started doing this after it added a 2nd \"Cavity Monster\", not sure if it updated & messed things up. My son still enjoys it & it has helped improve his brushing a lot. He bought a mask with diamonds but cant use it when brushing which is why he wanted it.",
            "My son is 5 and loves the app. But since the July update he's been stuck on the alien space level and it will not unlock the next level at all. All he ever gets out of the gifts is diamonds now. He was enjoying the progression but is now frustrated because he'll never get to see the rest of the levels. -Update to 1 star until this gets fixed.",
            "I love the update! My kid used to miss many spots. With the updated app, she concentrates much more on all sides of her teeth. She also loves the blind box rewards at the end.",
            "This app used to work great, but now its inoperable! ALL we get are vertical green lines instead of the camera, so we can't continue to the next screen to brush. I have a Samsung tablet also. PLEASE fix this!!!",
            "Horrible design. No matter which way my son is holding his toothbrush it keeps searching for it. I switched from his tablet to my phone and it's the same thing.. it spends more time searching than tracking."

        "comments": [
            "The brush itself and character are great, but the app is very glitchy. It doesn't record some days that they did brush with the app, and the parent dashboard is useless. I also think they could have done much better in developing the brush and program. The prizes are lame and repetitive, and education component is weak.( and wouldn't it be great if the app could review with your kids where they spent their brushing time after each brush? That technology exists and would be very helpful).",
            "Can't sync with other devices. My child is too young to brush his teeth alone and it's not always the same parent helping. Also when my phone died he had to start over so that was no fun. Additionally, he enjoys the app but the reward is almost always food. There is all kinds of food but the animation of the character eating is brief and always the same, so food is boring.",
            "A really great app that has engaged my daughter in her daily dental hygiene. After about 2 weeks it does become repetitious. I would suggest seasonal themed backgrounds and costumes. Trendy dance moves like the floss or even just a dab. Keeping the app up with current trends would get kids more motivate them to keep up their progress. Just a suggestion. Otherwise, great app. L-O-V-E it.",
            "App won't connect to the toothbrushes since the update. We had connectivity issues before, and usually got it to work for one of the toothbrushes before having to troubleshoot for the next toothbrush, but we could make it work well enough. Now the app won't even recognize the toothbrushes, even though I can show my phone lists it as an available device for Bluetooth. This app has been a major headache in our house.",
            "It often has trouble connecting to bluetooth with toothbrush. App mixes up characters between my 2 kids & they'll get upset thinking sister is using their program. My 1 girl gets all the awesome cat ears & stuff while the other gets only top hats & a plunger. Tonight my 1 girl got a 2nd present (gold) & the other did not. Needless to say that does not go over well with little kids... Downgrading to 1 star...keeps skipping the same one of my girls with the 2nd special present. Unnecessary tears."

            "I love it! I had to get the one year subscription because it really is worth it... although the way it is developed makes me learn too quick so I might not need the whole year 😅. I would not change anything except to be able to reset my progress by subject and save my performance so I can compare myself each time per each subject without having to reset everything. thanks for making my way of learning so productive 😊",
            "I was told by a friend to use this app. I went through the material and took the exam. I didn't find this app helpful at all. The exam was very different. I retook the exam using the remembered questions that float around and the exam was a breeze. I contacted the company several times about a refund starting in September. It is January and no refund has arrived. Personally, I would not recommend this to a friend. It is a waste of time and the guaranteed money back is not real!"

        "description": "There is nothing worse than the horrifying looks of yellow teeth. While this happens for many reasons ranging from too much caffeine and tea to taking a ton of antibiotics to your diet it can often be treated. However the cost for the treatment can be quiet costly and cost hundreds of dollars. Often times many dental plans won’t even cover this as it’s considered cosmetic and that leaves you with a huge bill. Why pay all that money when you have a host of ingredients that are right in your kitchen or can be purchased at your local grocery store for just a few dollars. Today we are going to show you the top ten home remedies for whitening your teeth.\r\n\r\nTooth Staining\r\nSmiles have a huge impact on first impressions. Stained teeth can make a smile look unsightly and can be the source of embarrassment, affecting a person’s confidence and self-esteem. The colour of the teeth is of particular cosmetic importance to a large number of people who seek dental treatment to improve their appearance. Knowing the cause of staining may influence dental hygiene treatment options and outcomes.\r\nTYPES OF TOOTH STAINS\r\nThere are two main types of tooth stains:\r\nIntrinsic stains – occur inside the tooth structure and cannot be removed by professional scaling (cleaning) or polishing.  Stains can result from alterations during tooth development, associated with antibiotic use \r\n(tetracycline), trauma, infection and dental fluorosis – swallowing large amounts of fluoride that cause white/brown spots on teeth and weaken the enamel. \r\nExtrinsic stains – appear on the tooth surface and can usually be removed by professional scaling or polishing. Stains occur from dyes in food, beverages, tobacco, mouth rinses, exposure to metallic compounds, the presence of chromogenic bacteria (colour-producing bacteria) and poor oral hygiene. The stains are absorbed onto tooth surface deposits such as plaque bacteria (white, sticky substance) that accumulate on teeth, especially around the gum line.\r\n\r\nHow to Make Your Teeth Whiter (without destroying your enamel)\r\n\r\nOur culture is becoming increasingly fascinated with white teeth.  With ‘news’ stories in front of us everyday showing us celebrities with their shiny, very white teeth, it seems that so many of us these days want to have an ultra white smile too.\r\n\r\nWe are told that conventional teeth whitening (bleaching) is safe from experts.  Yet others warn of the risks of conventional teeth whitening.  Much of the confusion stems from the fact that the ‘facts’ around teeth whitening have been blurred intentionally.  Then we hear how Julia Roberts only uses baking soda to keep her smile bright.  But is baking soda even a safe option?\r\n\r\nThere is always a way to whiten your teeth\r\n\r\nRISK FACTORS\r\n•\tPlaque forms a rough surface on enamel where stains can attach, giving teeth a dull and unsightly appearance.\r\n•\tPoor oral hygiene allows plaque and stains to build up.\r\n•\tSome restorations and crowded teeth can make plaque removal difficult.\r\n•\tDry mouth and the absence of saliva to wash away food and harmful bacteria promote plaque growth.\r\nIf you whiten teeth too often the enamel can wear down and weaken the tooth. It is for this reason that prevention (brushing your teeth and regularly visiting your dentist) is better for your oral health in the long run!\r\nAlways brush your teeth after eating or drinking something sweet.\r\nDo not put things on your teeth without knowing if it is good or bad - always consult your dentist first.\r\nAvoid drinking beverages like coffee, coke, and beer. These are known to stain the teeth. If you do choose to drink them, drinking through a straw can minimize contact of the fluids with your teeth.\r\n\r\nIf you like this Application please consider leaving a positive review and/or rating for it in the store.",

Now, after the operations, no feedback is given, what is somehow confusing, as we can get upset about some error having ocurred. This is important because this operations involve the entire app data.  2. give the option to show in the teeth chart: (i) all events to each tooth; (ii) only past events to each tooth (issues already solved); (iii) only future events (reminders) to each tooth (corresponding to issues yet to be worked on each tooth.

            "Absolutely garbage app; cannot pair with my new toothbrush. I've tried literally everything. I've contacted their support team multiple times and did every step they requested (even the one where they told me to reset my connection settings with no explanation on what that entailed... which cleared out all stored WiFi/bluetooth data in my phone and still did not help.) They even sent me a replacement handle and guess what? That doesn't pair with the app either! So yeah, don't waste your time.",
            "This app is mostly mediocre when it works. It is pretty dumb about recognizing the brush movement to the point where if you are leaning down it doesn't think you're brushing anything. On top of that it only checks for brushing front and back of teeth, not top. Also currently I can't even use it because it gets stuck trying to load the login popup forever. Feels very underbaked.",
            "Generally a good experience but the last 7 days doesn't load most of the time and it's the reason for the rating. Also wish the brush had a memory to upload later. Taking phone into bathroom everytime (twice day) to record brush session isn't realistic and gets annoying. For the money this should be an included feature on future models.",
            "10/24/2020 update: The latest update claims \"A redesigned experience makes setting up your toothbrush and app easier. Plus, technical updates improve the brush to app connection\" but the app only randomly connects with the toothbrush. I love the toothbrush but the app is now useless which is the #1 reason I bought the toothbrush. The app worked fine until the latest Android update on 10/01/2020 and now it will not connect to the toothbrush. This is the only Bluetooth connected device app I'm having trouble with after the Android update.",
            "App doesn't get through setup. I have a OnePlus 6, and a new SonicCare Diamond brush. Unboxed it and fully charged it. Then downloaded the app. Lit up the toothbrush by pressing the mode button, opened the app and it detected the toothbrush ok. But once I got to the \"Let's get started\" page it just spins like a record. Tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app. Can never get past that screen."

            "Took little time to get used to the app. excellent app for the dentists to keep the patients' records. We can add back logged cases as well. So you can keep a track of the cases you have done through this. Pretty simple interface and easy to use. The only reason I gave it 4 star is to draw the attention of the developer about some changes. When we are registering new patient info, provide space for 1. Age, 2. Sex, 3. Address. Rest of it is awesome.",
            "Amazing app it just needs some adds and it will be perfect, if it can send a notification of patients birthday and if you can add the expenses and the profits",
            "Nice and helpful I suggestst adding total daily and monthly income, and improving the export chart as it is not working with me",
            "Good but need to improve. No place to insert orthodontic treatments. Better if you can give chance to user to add treatment optioms. There must be a place to put next visit.",
            "Plz make new tasks independent from new patient records or manipulation Plz make new tasks appear easy in calender widget in less steps I love this programs too much Need more user friendly look Thank u for great program I love this no ads experience"

            "It's okay. Fun to watch your soldiers kill the monsters. A few problems, though. Game does not offer instruction on how to clean your teeth. If you change position while brushing, the camera easily loses you. If it loses you, it doesn't pause. My son was getting really frustrated because he was brushing his teeth properly, but the app lost his face and time ran out. Not a bad app, but there are better apps out there to encourage good brushing habits.",
            "UPDATE: After using this a bit, the limited duration of the timer (not a full 2 minutes, as recommended by dentists) and the prizes when hitting every 30 levels, means my child aggressively brushes just the front or sides of her teeth the whole time to reach these impossible higher levels. I wish it had some indicators to help children want to brush all of their teeth, as she just brushes the sides of her teeth (not the occlusal chewing (top) parts). Would be a 5* game with these additions.",
            "OMG!! I had my 6y.o. daughter giggling and smiling, and she brushed her teeth twice in succession! What a life saver! She has always been a hesitant brusher with tantrums and meltdowns galore, but tonight OMG, thank you so much!!! She's looking forward to eating brekky (another battle) just so she can go brush her teeth again- did I say thank you?! THANK YOU!!!",
            "Super fun for the kids- for some reason it registered really well when my son was playing, but when my daughter brushes, it doesn't register her brushes. She hated seeing her brother so successful and vanquishing so many Monsters when she tried so hard and couldn't. I'd love some hints- the fact that she is toothless for her front two teeth? The color of a toothbrush? Any ideas on how to help her? Otherwise, super fun and creative app. Kids love it and love bushing their teeth!!",
            "Must try for fussy brushers! Now my 7yo son looks forward to brushing! Would love to have the ability to change duration and also guide kids where to brush so that its more effective. But otherwise great work! Thanks!"

So they are able to fix it thanks for that ,just i wish in future better contact service",
            "A really great app, I highly recommend it, helped me study for the exam when I didn't have my notes with me and I managed to pass the exam on my first try with its help.  Just one question, does the yearly subscription automatically renew itself or do I have to cancel it? Since I'm not using it anymore, I'm not interested in being charged again for it."

            "I would leave 0 stars but that is not possible. The app doesn't work for Samsung phones and I have reported it numerous times with no responses from them. When I attended the seminar I informed Andy of the issue and he was aware it wasn't working for Samsung users and said they were working on the issue and it would be working in a few days. That's was over 3 weeks ago. I have boards In a month...this sucks!!!",
            "Unable to use app, get kicked out of anything I try to do. Spoke with Andy who said there was a fix for android or Samsung users and should be pushed out in a few days, that was over a week ago and still doesn't work. Very frustrating!",
            "App doesnt work at all, crashes every time i try to answer a questions. Reported it every time for a couple of weeks, then emailed them, now im doing this cause they have not responded or updated anything and now im getting really frustrated. The review is tomorrow, and boards are in 2 months",
            "This app is great if you have an iPhone, but the same cannot be said for Android users. App keeps crashing every time I (or my classmates who also use a Samsung) click on an answer to a test question. Pretty please fix this asap!"

Whitening is among the most popular cosmetic dental procedures because it can greatly improve how your teeth look. Most dentists perform tooth whitening.\r\n\r\nWhitening is not a one-time procedure. It will need to be repeated from time to time if you want to maintain the brighter color.\r\n\r\nWhat It's Used For\r\n\r\nThe outer layer of a tooth is called the enamel. The color of natural teeth is created by the reflection and scattering of light off the enamel, combined with the color of the dentin under it. Your genes affect the thickness and smoothness of the enamel. Thinner enamel allows more of the color of the dentin to show through. Having smoother or rougher enamel also affects the reflection of light and therefore the color.\r\n\r\nEvery day, a thin coating (pellicle) forms on the enamel and picks up stains. Tooth enamel also contains pores that can hold stains.",

So to see for yourself the whole process we've made a complex and dynamic game in the name of vets all over the world. \r\nTake the position and act like a real professional doctor for animals. As a dentist you need to know the whole procedures so you could execute the special treatment this kitty requires. Look close to all devices you've got in there and make sure you use the proper one for each step. Clean the area and get off the dirt accumulated among teeth. Brush them well, kill the bacteria then replace the bad teeth with brand new ones. You've got the chance to create a healthy smooth tooth paste from natural ingredients to make her teeth more white, strong and shiny. \r\n\r\nNow the next part requires a little bit of imagination and for sure you need to go insane to think about how a kitty’s look would be. Put on a fancy sun glasses or some accessories to make her look fantastic. Practice your nursing skills and try something new when it comes to create funny aspects for animals. Get compassion and feel free to help this cat with her wounds and her fashion orientation.\r\n\r\nThere are many features this game brings in order to be your favorite: \r\n- Free and easy to play\r\n- Joyful music and cool graphics\r\n- Develop new abilities and improve the old one\r\n- Become a doctor for animals and help them\r\n- Alternative way to create a tooth paste from healthy ingredients\r\n- Create a safe environment and a painless one\r\n- Learn the art of dental care and try to be a designer too\r\n- Take responsibilities and learn how to take care of a little baby cat",

Brought to you by AndyRDH, ValerieRDH and various dental hygiene faculty nationwide.\r\n\r\nWith this app, you will rock on the Board exam!\r\n\r\nDENTAL HYGIENE CASE STUDIES\r\n\r\nThis app is the ONLY app for case studies available in the world!  Studying for case studies is challenging and difficult.  Currently the only way to practice with case studies is to purchase a large, expensive case study book.  These books usually have 15-20 cases and cost between $40-60!  Not only do you have the large expense, but you have the problem of always having to carry it around with you.  With this NEW case study app you can literally study, anytime, anywhere!  This app currently has 25 detailed case studies very similar to what you will find on the REAL national Board exam.  We are currently working on adding more cases to the app and the price will go up at that time.  Buy it now while the price is at it's introductory price and get all the new cases for free once they are ready!\r\n\r\nThis app is completely interactive!\r\n\r\nWe have detailed explanations and rationales.  Research has shown that you LEARN and RETAIN information best when you know the rationales of why a question is correct or incorrect.  Studying with questions that only tell you if you are wrong or correct is similar to using flash cards.  Flash cards and similar type apps are good for quick quizzes but they do not help you actually digest the information and bring it from short term memory into long term memory, which is how research shows you learn best.  Detailed explanations and rationales are how you will study best and score high on the National Board!\r\n\r\nUse this app while waiting in line at the drive-thru, grocery store, waiting for lecture to start, or your clinic patient to come. No longer will you be worried about all the time you should have been studying, if only you had your textbooks.\r\n\r\nThis app rocks!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n25 Cases with 15 questions each.  Exactly the same amount of questions per case as the real National Board. (The real National Board exam contains 15 cases).  Purchase the app now and get FREE lifetime upgrades.\r\n\r\nSave your report card and email it to yourself or your faculty.  Post and share your scores to social media such as Facebook and Twitter.  Can you beat your classmates?  There will be contests and opportunities for FREE dental T-Shirts and keychains by sharing your screen shots using the #DentalHygieneAcademy.\r\n\r\nCountdown timer! Set you Board test date and graduation date and always see how many seconds are remaining! You’re closer than you think! Are you ready!?\r\nFour mock Board exams with 150 questions each. Rationales included for most questions! Ability to upgrade to more mock Boards.\r\n\r\nExclusive “Understood” option lets you mark a question as “understood” so that you no longer see that question again. We have an option in the settings menu to uncheck all understood questions if you want to see them again later.  Marking questions as understood, means each time you take the test, you only focus on ones that you don’t understand yet. Mark each one understood until you know and comprehend the questions and answers for all the questions! This insures you “know” before you “go” take the real Board exam.\r\n\r\nExclusive feature of converting your score percentage of correct answers to what it would be on the real Board exam! This is based off last year’s five test versions and will convert your percentage to what you would have made on the real test with your results. This is a must for gauging your studying and is only available based on Andy’s extensive research of multiple scoresheets.\r\n\r\nThese Mock Board questions are exclusive to Dental Hygiene Academy, Inc.\r\n\r\nGet this app and be confident on Board day!",

Tener dientes grandes es muy importante en la cultura de hoy en día, de ahí el creciente número de personas que usan tiras blancas en casa o que recurren a tratamientos profesionales de blanqueamiento dental en el consultorio. \r\n\r\nTus dientes son una de las primeras cosas que las personas notan; son un signo de salud y confianza.\r\n\r\nCuando se trata de la primera impresión, la mayoría se preocupa por tener dientes envejecidos, torcidos o descoloridos, lo que puede enviar una señal de que eres una persona despreocupada. ¿Quién no quiere tener una sonrisa hermosa con dientes blancos y brillantes? Pero, ¿cuál es la mejor manera de blanquear los dientes?\r\n\r\nDesafortunadamente, los tratamientos profesionales de blanqueamiento dental pueden ser muy costosos y no todas las personas tienen la suerte de poder visitar al dentista con regularidad y eliminar esas manchas tan desagradables. Sin embargo, hay una serie de tips caseros que pueden brindarte resultados sorprendentes, además de baratos y convenientes para tu bolsillo.\r\n\r\nPara comprender cómo funcionan estos tratamientos, es importante que comprendas qué puedes aclarar tu sonrisa si eres perseverante y a su vez tienes que tener en cuenta que hay ciertos alimentos que pueden hacer que tu sonrisa se vea manchada y lúgubre. Si buscas una sonrisa más blanca, debes limitar ciertas comidas y bebidas o evitarlas por completo.\r\n\r\nLa triste verdad es que algunas personas, sin importar cuántas veces se cepillen los dientes, han manchado los dientes por hábitos como beber café o té y / o fumar. A menudo, los dientes teñidos de amarillo o marrón también pueden señalar un problema más grande: encías poco saludables, esmalte delgado y una higiene dental deficiente en general. \r\n\r\nTienes que tener en claro que blanquear los dientes por sí solo no ayudará a proteger los dientes o las encías de las caries o enfermedades, como la gingivitis, por lo que, aunque los dientes blancos son algo agradable de tener, debes tener una buena higiene dental.\r\n\r\nA continuación te explicamos algunos remedios caseros que te ayudan a blanquear los dientes de forma natural, al tiempo que mejora la higiene oral general. \r\n\r\nEl cepillado regular y el uso del hilo dental, el bicarbonato de sodio y el peróxido de hidrógeno, el aceite de coco y la aplicación de productos como el vinagre de manzana pueden blanquear los dientes de forma natural, además de ofrecer beneficios como protección antiséptica y antibacteriana.",

A menudo, los dientes teñidos de amarillo o marrón también pueden señalar un problema más grande: encías poco saludables, esmalte delgado y una higiene dental deficiente en general. <br><br>Tienes que tener en claro que blanquear los dientes por sí solo no ayudará a proteger los dientes o las encías de las caries o enfermedades, como la gingivitis, por lo que, aunque los dientes blancos son algo agradable de tener, debes tener una buena higiene dental.<br><br>A continuación te explicamos algunos remedios caseros que te ayudan a blanquear los dientes de forma natural, al tiempo que mejora la higiene oral general. <br><br>El cepillado regular y el uso del hilo dental, el bicarbonato de sodio y el peróxido de hidrógeno, el aceite de coco y la aplicación de productos como el vinagre de manzana pueden blanquear los dientes de forma natural, además de ofrecer beneficios como protección antiséptica y antibacteriana.",

            "I am a dentist. And I think this app is a great idea. I don't know why no one thought of it before. One request to developer is to make the button not fine to say not fine. And to make an additional button saying I think I am going to faint. Also make One button saying my legs are feeling cramped. And one button saying the dental light is bothering me. Could you shift its position. This additional buttons will be extremely useful. One button saying I am gagging or feel like vomiting will also be useful. As also one saying, I think I am going to sneeze or I think I am going to cough. And one saying Could you suck the water from my mouth please. The developer - Your idea is really great and will help people a lot. You could also make one for patients of trauma in other specialities who have neck braces or find it difficult to talk. Looking forward to you incorporating my suggestions. Once these suggestions are incorporated give a paid version that doesn't carry ads. I will buy it. Thanks.",

        "description": "Currently you may be considering installing dental braces. Braces, or also known as braces, can indeed change your appearance and cause discomfort at the start of installation. However, dental braces can help you overcome various oral and dental problems.\r\n\r\nBraces or braces are often associated with dental care for children or adolescents. This is because usually the teeth that are less neat are only clearly visible in adolescence. Even so, there is actually no age limit for using braces. You can use braces at any age to fix your teeth. As long as your teeth and gums are still healthy and strong.\r\n\r\nBraces are not recommended for those of you who have unhealthy gums and teeth because the installation of braces puts excessive pressure on the gums and teeth. Generally people wear braces for two years. However, the duration of using stirrup for each person can be different. This depends on the condition of each of your teeth.\r\n\r\nThere are options for faster dental therapy methods. However, usually this option is not recommended unless your teeth are really healthy and strong. In addition, this therapy is usually more painful than traditional braces therapy. The reason is, this method of therapy involves a small operation on your jaw. So, even though the therapy lasts only about six months, the healing process is more uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe long duration of using stirrup puts you at risk of changing dentists. Especially if you have to move your residence. Well, changing dentists can cause the cost of installing braces to increase.\r\n\r\nBefore installing the braces, you should first consider whether you can routinely go to the same dentist for a long time. This is because before installing the braces, you must sign a contractual agreement with the dentist of your choice.\r\n\r\nIf you change dentists, you must negotiate with your dentist to terminate the contract. Most dentists are willing to make concessions in terminating the contract, but some are unwilling.",
