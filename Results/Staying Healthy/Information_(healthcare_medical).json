I put the range the result was supposed to be in, but when you go back to that result, the note section is gone. It didn't make any sense to put it there. There is a special note section, but I didn't know I needed to put it in there to keep it. Also on medication list. Not a section on meds to show what it treats. I highly recommend .",
            "It's pretty good so far but a bit insufficient. You can use the app for multiple people and on the main page, you select the person you want. But then when you go into a category and choose an option to view (like appointments or meditations), you have to choose the person again. It gets annoying to choose the person each time you want to view something different even though that person is selected on the main page.",

In case of emergency or even a doctor's appt., lab work, x-rays any type of procedure with or without a hospital stay, they all want to know what Meds u take, what Doc referred, what Pharmacy u use. Now I don't have to carry a notebook with all this info in it. Most people always have their phone them."

            "It's helpful to be able to access my records, including lab reports, in one secure place. O also like that I can send/receive messages, request refills, and use the portal for televisits. I have linked my Fitbit tracker to the site, so my daily exercise, sleep, and weight can be seen by my physician. The app is easy to use on my phone and laptop. Thank you!",
            "I wish I could give this zero stars.. Absurdly difficult to use. Terrible. Takes forever to set up. And when you get your own results there's no explanation of what they mean. Difficult to find anything. Slow. Very tiny font with poor contrast with background. Easier to just call and get results. Even if you have to wait 30 minutes. I HATE THIS APP! I HATE THIS APP!",
            "Several features do not work - cannot schedule appointment, limited devices support for health monitoring Syncing with external devices is very difficult or impossible due to limited devices - no sleep sync, no weight sync, no blood pressure sync, will not sync with Samsung Health app, not Samsung smartwatch - Active 2. Overall the app takes more time than it's worth to use. Do NOT Recommend this app. Tell your healthcare provider not to consider it for their patient access.",
            "To get to the waiting room, I had to go through the vitals entry screen first. I dont know my vitals when doing a televisit from home. I had to call to find out that you just leave them blank and go on through that screen to wait for provider to come on. Seems awkward and not obvious (user friendly) to me. Otherwise I love doing provider visits this way as I live 5 hours away from this specialist with no others near me.",
            "GREAT APP!!!! I really like having access to my records especially my med list, co-pays AND Medication Timers!!! I have used the Televisit option since the beginning of the year. It is very easy. I LOVE having the ability to have a Video appointment with my physician. Great App!!! I would give more stars if possible... Grateful in New Mexico"

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

But the only issue I have is that it doesn't give me very many options in the very beginning and none of them fit the description of where I am having the health issues. However I do like that the questions after the first category is fairly thorough which is nice and how it should be. I just wish it gave more category of options of health issues at the very beginning to better pin point what is wrong so I can get the correct treatment for my symptoms.",
            "i think that this is probably the best way they could have created a free, un-official diagnosis app. i guess i'll give it 4 stars though. my only suggestion is maybe: when you get to the end of the process and it shows you your diagnosis, highlight the title of that page, or make it stand out a little more(just so i dont just click past it thinking its just another disclaimer, and have to start all over again) . either that, or let the user look at their past activity within the app itself :)",
            "I love this app because it touches base on whats going on with your body though you should always get a second opinion from a medical dr and never try to take any kind of vitamin or drug without talking with your dr first this is a amazing app",
            "This is an ad-grab app. The assistance it offers is bad, only supports a couple of diseases from pre-written answers. A beginner student could have made this app. It displays at least 3 ads before you get to your \"diagnosis\" (which was far from correct, by the way.) They claim it's artificial intelligence and that they got help from doctors, but honestly, it looks like they just googled \"common diseases\" and \"how to make an app\" and combined the search results.

I first started using it after I had started a new med and had some bad interactions. Even my doctor hadn't warned me about them. I was able to request a med change and get it resolved. It's also helped me avoid several over the counter meds that I wouldn't have known not to take otherwise. There are a lot of other features, but that's the main one I use.",
            "I really was impressed with this app and all it offered. Until I spent over an hour inputting all my drugs, then got a message that the app had an update and I needed to update it, turn it off, then re-open. Upon doing so, all the descriptive info, like dosages, etc. were gone. The next day at my MD visit, I was unable to pull up a simple list of my drugs. When I put in a drug name, nothing I'd put in was available. So I'd wasted all my time entering everything. Won't do it again! Delete!",

It is great for checking medication and food interactions, as well as looking at side effects of each medication.",

I bought the premium subscription because the ad placement made the app difficult to use, but the ad free upgrade for a year is really affordable. Thank you for this app!"

            "The app is not up to date. For some reason, not all the providers are listed. The charts arent updated no matter how many times i request it. The formatting is poor. If i look in a category such as test results it brings up one big list of results, there is no organization such as by date. It could be a great app and a great way to communicate with my doctor if worked correctly.",
            "Very frustrating, I'm rarely able to log in without 9 or 10 tries. Once I log in, the info I need is almost impossible to find. I spent nearly an hour trying to submit a refill. The pharmacy info has to be entered EXACTLY as the pharmacy has it registered or you cannot find it anywhere. Nearly impossible to delete sent messages. I have NEVER been able to use this app without getting errors to try again later. It's easier to call the clinic and spend my time on hold instead of using this app.",
            "This was great when it worked, but now it no longer works on my phone. Galaxy note 8. This used to work, but now it hits on an endless loop telling you you to use a browser like chrome. Even after you try to access it in the browser requested, it does the same thing. Please fix this. I loved it when it worked correctly.",
            "This is a wonderful app to communicate with a doctor. It is much faster than calling. One thing to change if possible is the ability to send for example, a picture of what's going on if I am concerned about something. However, HIPPA requirements may restrict this feature within the app. Also, rather than exiting the app every time when waiting for a Dr's answer & logging in again etc. One log in would be nice."

Tried the \"forgotten username\" & \"forgotten password\", said I would receive email. TWO HOURS AND COUNTING, STILL NO DAMN EMAIL!!! But then again, what did I expect?

The best it does is show me how far along my deductible is and give me the number to call them to discuss everything I should have been able to figure out from the app.",

Perhaps developer should concentrate on developing the app to it potential, as it feels like it is in beta and then charge a one time upgrade fee.

            "The service is AMAZING! I have no regrets using this app to chat with a doctor for something quick. The reason I knocked 2 stars off though is the AI at the start of EVERY chat. It only lists symptoms and takes you through a very thorough, automated chat session. If you are someone who doesn't know what you're dealing with it would be really useful, however in any case where you know your issues, such as Asthma and you're in need of a simple prescription/refill - it'd be nice to skip it.",
            "These doctors are awesome! They listen to you and help you! I didn't think it was real at first. But I had an ear infection and a doctor wouldn't see me for a month. So I tried this and they called in ear infection meds instantly and they said 3-4 days before your better but I started feeling better in an hour! Excellent app!! Thank You for having this available. Highly recommended!!!",
            "My experience was great!! I'm so glad this worked just like it's promised to. I paid for the service of $19 and was given a receipt through email. After downloading the app I answered some questions about my issue, took maybe 10 minutes, and was then directed to a certified doctor. She asked me a few questions and sent the prescription I needed to the pharmacy of my choice. I called to verify if they'd received it and sure enough it was and being filled. I highly recommend this service!!",
            "Its okay, but it always takes you to worst case scenario. Like I have pain in my ribs. Localized, no fever, no headache, no chills, no sneezing, no coughing, no shortness of breath, wasn't near anyone sick... It told me I either had an upper respiratory or pneumonia. I actually somehow tore the cartilage between the ribs, likely from lifting something too heavy. Bruised ribs wasn't even a suggestion.",
            "Very user friendly simple AI. Very cool AI also asks your symptoms to help diagnose incase one is a closet hypochondriac.suppose one could get a subscription monthly and just see what one might MAYBE could sorta kinda have. If that were the case just saying cause I thought it was superfluous knowing already what I had and what I needed medication for but for real diagnosis there is the option to speak to a dr. And if possible they prescribe a medication for you and send it to your pharmacy"

            "There's a strange log in bug. I have a Pixel 2 that's running on Android 11. When trying to log in, if I don't get a blank notification from My health+ it will just sit on the blue screen with a stethoscope graphic. If you have this issue, I suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the app until you get this blank notification. Do not close it or you won't be able to log back in as I could only get it to pop up on the first start-up. Hopefully they fix this soon.",
            "This app didnt work on my smartphone device. It would.load my personal page. Said my password was wrong. When it wasnt. Tried to reset it, but the reset code didn't work and website said their own reset code was incorrect. The medical advisors told me it would be easy and must be done online. I let doesnt work. The phone number one can call says their is a 3 hour wait time. This is an awful waste of time and needs to be renovated or something.",
            "Updating my review to 5 stars after Intermountain contacted me directly and solved my issue with the app. I have a Pixel phone and a late September update to the app caused a bug that wouldn't allow Pixel users to login. I left a review and Intermountain contacted me directly and updated me when they released a patch to fix the bug. Great communication and I'm so glad I can use the app again instead of the web version!",
            "Was a great app, when I could use it, but now (possibly since my Pixel 2 updated to Android 11) won't launch. Have cleared cache, cleared data, and even uninstalled/reinstalled (including repeating all of those steps right now, on 10/25/2020 with the most recent version that was supposed to resolve the problem), but it gets stuck on the screen with a stethoscope and a spinning circle (the screen that appears after entering your log-in information, while log-in is happening), and will go no further.",
            "Very buggy. Every time I open the app all I get is \"An error occurred\" so it is useless to have. If it worked I'm sure it would be awesome. I got a text saying I have a message in the app but I can't see it. To call in the wait time is over 2 hours. The need for a working app is real both for intermountain and it's patients."

I had booked test from thyrocare lab through this app, then made the payment, next day they collected the blood sample and after few hours it showed cancelled in the app without any reason..... I had tried to contact them many times but they failed to give any solution..... I was waiting for my reports.... But after 3 days pharmeasy called me and asking to order another pay for the same and they will test my 3 days old blood sample.... Is it a joke??",
            "FBPLUS coupon not activated after the product delivered. When reached to customer service they have only 1 reply issue forward to concern department. They have not any TAT when the issue resolved or any ticket number for the escalation. My suggestion don't buy with FBPLUS coupon if you think you will get PLUS membership. As they have not any proper channel to address the issue. I was suffering form this issue since last 4 days.",

            "Update, after using this app for a while now I've moved my rating from 5 starts to 1. I have set this app up to use fingerprint instead of entering my password and the app only allows this once in a great while. It makes me change my password almost everytime I try to log in which is not convenient, especially when you're standing in the doctor's office and people are waiting on you. The app wastes so much time trying to change password everytime I need to view something. I'm over it!",
            "Oh would you like to be called when an agent is available? We'll have a person call you and then put you on hold for over 50 minutes just to ask a question that takes maybe 1 minute to answer about plan coverage. Do we offer this on the app? Nope! Not for the provider you work with. Just random doctors when you try to search the term on our app. Still on hold for something this app could have easily answered as the provider is in network.",
            "I love this app! Especially that it shows a copy of your insurance card in case there's ever an emergency i can just pull it up on my phone! This app has all of the important info you need (phone numbers, links, etc) and answered all of the questions I had!",
            "Great link to your insurance needs and account details. Helps with all kinds of things like appointment making and doctor finding. I think my health improved just from the warm feelings using the app gave me.",
            "Good app. I wish I could rate it at 4.5 but can't. Pretty easy to find info. The only problem is not the app, it's trying to drill down to found the Doctor i need. Did it and found the right doctor 4 miles away"

Any doctor in the network can be reached with questions etc. Very easy to use. I love when I get lab work done I always see the results before the drs call me. So I am already aware of results. Love it! Recommend it! Use it! ♡",

In fact, it became necessary after I had my lower jaw all but severed by a dog bite! We were in Podunk & outside my med coverage area - the information provided to the entire team working on me led to an infusion my blood required & work that led to an incredible recovery. If not for the info, I could have easily bled out b/c I do not clot. It also has made things easy w/new doctors.",

Otherwise, this app is wonderful, and everything I need to keep doctors informed about my very complex medical history, and give them reliable resources on my rare conditions.",
            "Very useful and will be a great tool! The only criticism I have, and why \nthe 4 stars, is based upon the share cards. I have just started utilizing \nthis app, and I will definitely keep doing so. However- on each condition, \nit gives you the option to input notes, dates, photos etc. I had done that \nwhen testing this app out, and it is stored within that condition (on the \napp). The downfall lies in the fact that when you use a share card, which I \nwill definitely need to utilize... all of the notes and photos are randomly \nacquired at the bottom of the pdf. They are not listed under the condition- \nI had a random note that was under one condition indicated I did not know \nwhen this symptom began progressing- if you use the app, and choose the \ncondition, you'll see that note in the app under appropriate condition and \nit would make sense. However, the pdf doesn't indicate what \nconditions/symptoms etc. that it corresponds to, so health providers will \nhave zero idea what one (out of so many unfortunately lol) I am talking \nabout or referring to :/ and photos are also the same way- those I guess \nyou can rename every one, but it would be nice if a med professional who \nisn't interested in every condition or photo we uploaded could see what \nphotos we uploaded for that specific condition- instead of having to sort \nthrough at bottom where they're all just piled together- we all know most \ndoctors won't take the time to sort and find photos that may be of a great \nimportance to what they're trying to treat ha. I really love the app other \nthan those two specific things- and I hope adjustments can be made in the \nfuture, as it will Truly help!! :)"

Unfortunately • I can't load a photo in the profile (\"Unable to load photo\" error message). • I'd love a search feature so I can tell the Dr when a particular event last happened. • It would be nice to also be able to change symptom icons too. Fix these 3 things and I'll rate a well deserved 5/5.",

If they are sick then second level would be something like \"has a sore throat\", or fever. I don't want to look through a list of 50 illness to find fever. It just didn't work for me.",

            "I honestly love this app. I have used in on and off for years. I recently started using this app again this year. I have been trying to register an account with Mango, but each time I try it gives me an error of \"registration unavailable\" - every time. So 4 stars. I also wish you could add your own habits to the app. Like a custom habit that you could edit, and congifure to fit your needs. I use other apps for habits I can't track in Mango. Would be nice to be able to track it all in one place.",
            "It is great for putting your meds in and keeping track with what you eat. What it does not do is take into consideration not ALL people are glued to their phones to add the information in when it wants it. Yes you can add it in later but does not give you your points. As well as not being linked to other apps like my Samsung watch which keeps track of my steps and this app does not even register 1 step and again does not give me points. How about calories since your tracking food?",
            "This is my go to app to input my health information. It would be nice if it would connect to other apps like Fitbit, Garmin, Onetouch for glucose monitor results so i only have to input in one app and Mango picks it up. Also would be nice if reminders can be adjusted based on weekdays or weekends. I wear my watch to bed to monitor sleep and my watch buzzes at 6am on weekends because I have it programmed for 6am on weekdays.",
            "This app really pushes you to take your medication and other healthy habits of your choice. I've only used this for 2 days now but I already appreciate how helpful it is. I love the leveling system and the rewards you can get the more you stay on track. A+ app in my book. :)",
            "Have not received a reminder notification for the last 4 days. All notifications are turned on and had been working, although it had been messing up randomly prior to last update. Not useful to me anymore without the reminders."

Devs, please take notice of this and look for a fix of this app-crippling bug. I will be happy to give 5 stars when it's working again.",

            "Quick & Easy; Didn't have to leave home! I have had pain in the past and my prescriptions helped, but I hated the side effects. I've also had some issues with anxiety and depression too, but I didn't want to risk combining prescriptions (if I had gotten any). Had a medical cannabis card before, but chose to try this app instead of going back to renew it. This was very easy; got to video chat with the doctor who okayed everything in just a few minutes. I would totally recommend this app. Rated 5⭐",
            "been with these guys for like three years now. they never forget to give a reminder when my card is about to expire. i've also got several referral discounts. i also gave their store a try. good service. would definitely recommend",
            "Easy and streamlined process. Got my recommendation after a few minutes. Thank you.",
            "App works great! Payment got accepted in a single go. The doc was polite and patient. All in all good experience with this medical card provider.",
            "I'v tired a few of cannabis recommendation service. But, I Prefer Online Medical Card over others. The consultation was done thoroughly. Highly recommend."

As well as an AI symptom checker. The $10 monthly fee for telemedicine visits is very reasonably priced, and you can cancel your subscription at anytime. Much better than going to an urgent care clinic during a pandemic. And perfect for requesting prescription refills from the comfort and safety of home.",
            "Love it! Great pricing, and I had a Doctor in two minutes. Talked to the Doctor for about 15 minutes, and my prescription was ready by the time I got to the pharmacy. I get a lot of sinus infections, so this is perfect when I just need a prescription.",
            "Didn't have insurance and didn't have to put out of pocket during pandemic but money wasn't an issue I received a consult a prescription and so much kindness from Dr. Goldeburg then I ever have from any high prices DRs this app is no joke it really did save my life and prevented a stroke a heart attach without the fear anxiety or leaving where I feel safe. Try it is the act of to good but true",

I try to msg him 2 wks later but turns out the drs can turn their messages off and you have to set a new appt. I don't have the money for that ($125/appt). Today I had an appt at 11, he changed it twice overnight to 10am, and I missed it (I work late hours). Now I have a notice saying they have a 24 hr cancellation policy & $40 charge? Not my fault!!",
            "10/29/20 App loaded easily & fast on my Galaxy Note 8. Set up was simple & my PCP staff was extremely helpful with walking me tthru it. Video pic very easy to see MD & clear/sound voice to hear. Since chemo this way of communicating with my PCP has been a Godsend! Not only due to weakness but to avoid contact with others, Covid 19, arrangements for travel & more. TY to whomever designed this program👍🏻KUDOS TO YOU❗",
            "The provider was great and the app was convenient and very easy to use. The only problem was the technical difficulties they had yesterday. It prevented me from getting to see the doctor at all.",
            "The doctors are very nice attentive and make sure they are very thorough. They also make sure you are comfortable with them and they make u feel like they care not saying that they don't but it's nice the way u r not rushed bc of another patient due to the office being backed up... visual visits are the best and they coordinate with your other doctors as well for the best treatment plan!!!! Great application and doctors!!!",
            "It took a little longer than I had hoped. The provider I chose never arrived. After waiting about 20 minutes, I was asked if I would like to change providers and I did and was connected in about 5 minutes. She was very kind and helpful and I will definitely keep her name for future visits!"

Offline viewing (storing content/videos on SD card) would increase the usefulness of the app dramatically - many areas on base (also at sea) have no cellular reception (much less wifi). It would be fantastic for the app to take advantage of SD card storage for offline study of the materials. Thank you developers for this app.",

Specifically: Launching the app with no internet connection presents you with an empty library regardless of whether or not you have downloaded anything. App also resets to \"default profile\" with no connection. Logging in and keeping the app active in the background is the only way to view your library \"offline\"",

Ex: Advance directive, power of attorney,\r\ninsurance cards, driver’s license, etc.\r\n\r\nInstant Access to Your Data is Important\r\nMyLinks enables you to have your own “mini electronic medical record” fully controlled by you and accessible to you at any time. In case of an emergency, it is important to have quick and easy access to a single view of all your records. And because you can link charts, you are also able to help family members in an emergency. \r\n\r\nCorrect and Complete Data \r\nMost doctors don’t have all your records and may have outdated or incorrect information. MyLinks allows you to add, edit, and correct information that you can then share with others. (NOTE: Edits to your record will not automatically be sent to your care provider.)\r\n\r\nAdvanced Technology\r\nIn 1996, HIPAA gave patients the right to access to their medical records, but gathering records from each doctor is often a VERY difficult process. MyLinks makes this process easy. We use a new technology standard called FHIR® (pronounced “fire”) to connect you to all clinics who are using the latest certified Electronic Health Records technology. MyLinks is already connected with 26,000+ clinics - and we’re growing every day! Our provider list will grow as clinics upgrade to the newest certified Electronic Health Record systems. If you don’t see your clinic listed in MyLinks, please contact our team and we will reach out to your provider. If they don’t have FHIR yet, be patient; they may need more time.\r\n\r\nWhat Data is Imported?\r\nCurrently, most clinics allow you to gather the following information: Problems, medications, allergies, labs, vital signs, procedures, immunizations, equipment, smoking status, and some types of documents. Soon, new laws will expand the types of information available to you.\r\n\r\nYour Data is Safe\r\nAll patient data is stored in a secure HIPAA-compliant cloud, which is fully encrypted at all times. MyLinks makes it possible to access your health data from anywhere, at any time. Use your app login, or go to MyLinks.com to log in using any device.\r\n\r\nWe take great care in protecting your data. Rest assured, we’ll never share your data with anyone! We believe sharing your data should ALWAYS be your choice.",

            "Looks like a great app, however... could you make it so that you can enter your insurance provider manually? It's a bit frustrating to not be able to add my info when not all insurance companies are listed. Also, I had a problem trying to select a certain one, as no matter what I did, it would only select the incorrect one above it. I would rate it 5 stars if it weren't for these issues. Thanks!",
            "I am so glad I used this app! I was prepared to be frustrated or disappointed, but Im so grateful this app and service is available to us! The doctor was spectacular! Our hometown was struck by Hurricane Michael and my physicians office was included in the destruction, unfortunately. If this was not an option for us, I would have to hunt for a physicians office that open, functioning, and in-network with the added potential to drive like 50 miles away (which is a long trip when one is feeling well, none-the-less sick). I am so grateful I could see someone from home! I highly recommend this!!",
            "It would have been nice to know that there is no access allowed for new patients before they spend time getting this app setup.. ridiculous",
            "I don’t normally write reviews but this is the app I can actually put a seal of approval on. I don’t have time to see the dr. So this is wonderful. All you need is your HSA savings card and do the online paperwork. I got sick one Saturday and just kept getting worse. By 9pm I was very sick. I saw the dr on my own couch wrapped up in my blanket. All I had to do was pick up my antibiotics at the pharmacy drive thru and went home. Again. Great App.",
            "This app is phenomenal. Woke up with strep throat and dont have insurance. I am a veteran and usually just pay the local urgent care clinic a visit when I get sick. Took about 10 minutes to register and set an appointment. Took a photo of the back of my throat and my temperature. Few minutes later my doctor was online and we had a brief consultation. She was friendly, knowledgeable and had a prescription for penicillin out to the pharmacy at the corner of my street by the time we were done. Unless they need to take blood or an X-ray, I cannot imagine ever going back to a brick and mortar clinic again. Highly recommend."

And if this happens only occasionally, why wasn't I informed? Absolute trash -- find a better platform than this for yourself, honestly.",
            "I really like this app, it's pretty user friendly, I've always been connected to a doctor in under 10 mins, they have a large selection of doctors to choose from and the doctors have all been really awesome. They accept my anthem blue cross so I've never had to pay out of pocket. Great job!",

Tried again, re-entered all my info and the app switched me to an emergency room Dr on its own. Kind of glitchy. Received my visit summary 12 hrs later. Serves its purpose but needs some improvement.",

Can't believe with all the money people are forced to pay in healthcare under the illusion of \"choice\", this is the best you can do. This app barely functions. Basic relevant plan information is buried, half the apps functionality is locked behind agreeing to a third party T&C to share information with a company I never heard of, I guess you can't have ANOTHER data breach if you just get customers to agree to share their info huh?",
            "I just downloaded after 6 hours trying and then the first time only one time that I tried it's telling me that I run out of tries how can it be if I only try once and just like the others reviews this app sucks not good what is the point the worst how can I get help i need a doctor and I can't get it is it a way to just get our money and not give us the service that I been paying every month for what is going on ???????????????????????????????",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

No waiting a week to be seen. I was in within 15 minutes from the time I scheduled. Very happy with my experience.",
            "The app doesn't work. I keep getting no appointments available for the entire month (checked oct 1 thru oct 31). I then called for the 2nd time requesting an appt in the evening and was told the latest appt was 1230... all advertisement says appt as late as 7 pm. Asked if I could book for Nov bc all late appts were already booked but they don't do appointments until last week of Oct for nov. Was previously told that for oct but when called all evening appts were booked. This company is a joke!",
            "I love the Dr they chose for me and how easy it was to get appt. I was even able to get an appt at 620 pm!! after work.",
            "I've had two consultations so far and they've exceeded my expectations. The app itself is intuitive and I've had no issues navigating it.",
            "the support number was very helpful and my appointment with a provider was great, I definitely think it's worth calling support if you need to!"

            "Had an appt for my daughter with the EAP that we waited a couple of weeks for. I downloaded the app and set up an account a week in advance. We joined our appt 15 min early. When the appt time came the provider's video wouldn't connect. We were connected to wifi and had a strong signal. We kept waiting and about 10 min after appt time we got a notification that the provider had canceled the appt. We didn't get a call, the appt was just canceled due to the provider's connectivity problem.",
            "I have had many telehealth appointments and always something happens with the connection or the volume of the voice. It's very difficult when you are trying to do psychotherapy about trauma and halfway through the connection dies or you can't hear your provider anymore. This needs lots of work!",
            "The only frustrating part was they say they treat everything...except earaches...go figure. My doc office didnt want to see me, they sent me to this app....I've lived long enough to know I dont like this techno filled world. Just too odd for this old gal. Now headed to instacare."

Also can add collaborators to read or add info to crate this awesome experience! Online baby photo book that backs up. Baby 101 info or searchable reading info that shows the source info so you can be assured that it's reliable stuff. Also baby quizzes so you can test your knowledge. Total 1 stop shop.",

The email that he receives appears to have a link that says \"Accept Invite\". However, it's not clickable. Is there another way for him to accept my invite to be added as a collaborator?",
            "I like the tracking options but I would not suggest this app to anyone. I am a nanny and have 2 babies to take care of. Half the time the app lags or doesn't save my information I put in. It is SOOOO frustrating and a waste of my time away from the babies to literally re-input 1/4 of what I already typed in. I've been using it for 10 months and I'm switching because it gets me so frustrated.",
            "this app initially worked well, but once we had over 1,000 photos for our first child and we added our second child we started having tons of issues. not worth the frustration. we are moving to a different app because of all the issues. I did like the little weekly and monthly informational bites."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

Find doctors, book appointments, and even organize all of your family’s providers in one easy-to-reach place. \r\n\r\nFind Quality Doctors and Dentists\r\nStart your search with the type of doctor you need and your location, or look up a specific doctor’s name. Use new map-based search to find providers within a specific geographic area. Filter results by factors including insurance carriers accepted, gender, patient reviews, and how far you’re willing to travel. Each profile includes important details about a doctor’s experience, education, care philosophy, board certifications, and awards--all of which help you make confident decisions about your care and select the best doctor for you. \r\n\r\nConnect With Providers Through Telehealth\r\nFilter your search to find doctors who schedule appointments via telehealth, or connect with a provider right away for on-demand telehealth appointments.\r\n\r\nEasily Book and Prepare for Appointments\r\nYou can filter your search results to view doctors who accept online appointment scheduling, or tap to call right from a doctor’s profile. Before you head out the door for your appointment, click “Get Directions” on your doctor’s profile in the app to launch navigation from your phone. For quicker check-in at your doctor’s office, store a copy of your insurance card in the app to have it readily at hand. \r\n\r\nBuild Your Family’s Medical Care Teams\r\nOnce you’ve found the right doctors--or want to keep track of the doctors you already have--you can build individual Care Teams for each member of your family. From your account, you can add a family member profile, including your spouse, children or parents for whom you manage care. No more tracking down doctor information from various places on your desktop--now you can find everything you need, for every family member, all in one easy family healthcare management tool.\r\n\r\nRead Patient Reviews and Rate Your Own Doctors\r\nSee what previous patients have said about their experiences with doctors to help decide which one is right for you. Star ratings reflect how likely patients are to recommend a doctor to a friend or family member. You can also see how patients rated office environment, staff friendliness, and wait times. After your appointment, open the app to rate and review your own doctor to help future patients like you make informed choices about their care.",

            "Nursing central is perhaps the best tool that any nursing student can use. I also love the fact that you don't need internet to use the app actively! Sometimes I get into dead zones within the hospital and that feature solves that problem. The information is also very detailed within the app and the search function works great.",
            "I loved this app ... I hate that when I set it up, I used my school email & no longer can sign into it bc I forgot my login. This app was so helpful, I'd recommend it to anyone.",
            "Love it, I use this app all the time, at school, at work, in daily conversations.... always been a very dependable app. It was a bit expensive, but no more than any other nursing textbook... Update to the above review: Upon the recent purchase of a new phone, I was informed I could not access my Nursing Central App anymore on the new device. This is due to the fact that my 2 year \"subscription\" ended in May. This makes me unhappy because I paid alot of money for this. I should be able to.",
            "Amazing. Easy to use and navigate. This helped me through school a lot. Highly recommend.",
            "Easy to use. Necessary information presented in brief summary format. Very helpful. I use it almost every shift to provide the best nursing care i can. Highly recommend to all professional nurses."

With My Medical, any and all information that is important to you is kept together in one place.\r\n\r\n✦ It's for the whole family ✦\r\nMy Medical isn't just one medical record. You can keep as many records as you want. Use it for a spouse or aging parents. Use it to keep immunization records for your children. Use it to look after a special needs child. Doctors, nurses and clinicians: use My Medical to maintain notes about your patients.\r\n\r\n✦ A medical record and more ✦\r\nAreas for emergency contacts, health insurance, doctors' contact information, and other data that are not strictly part of a traditional personal health record (PHR) are all available. And if you already have medical contacts in your address book, then perfect, because My Medical can import it in the tap of a finger. There's no need to retype it all.\r\n\r\n✦ And it works with your calendar ✦\r\nMy Medical will automatically put doctor's appointments, prescription due dates and upcoming lab tests on your phone or tablet's calendar app.\r\n\r\n✦ A digital file cabinet ✦\r\nMy Medical devotes an area to image files that can be attached to your record. You can tie files to particular items anywhere within your information. So add a picture of the pill next to a medication, or keep a copy of your insurance card alongside a provider's contact information.\r\n\r\n✦ From blood tests to X-rays ✦\r\nMy Medical provides a range of common test result templates for you to track test results. To name just a few: blood pressure; cholesterol; metabolic panels; blood sugar; CAT scan; height and weight. If that isn't enough, construct and customize your own test results to keep track of exactly what you need.\r\n\r\n✦ Visualize it ✦\r\nChart test results with sophistication; with the graphing feature you can view multiple plots simultaneously, zoom to specific ranges and identify points of interest.\r\n\r\n✦ It's secure ✦\r\nUnlike most other health record applications, data is stored right on your device, not on remote servers. So you don't need to worry about who can see your data at the other end of the line.

As a further safety measure, you may require a password in order to view all or certain parts of your information.\r\n\r\n✦ In case of emergency ✦\r\nMy Medical is a valuable aid for EMTs, first responders, or those who may need to quickly find out emergency instructions. Even if you have password-protected the app, certain information is made accessible in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n✦ We're independent ✦\r\nMy Medical is independent of hospitals, medical centers, and government. Because your records are maintained by you, their contents are whatever aspects of your health that you care to monitor. That means not having to deal with confusing, legally required information often found in the records of health care providers. In short, My Medical personal health records are for you, the patient.\r\n\r\n✦ Get the word out ✦\r\nSharing your information has never been easier.

            "I bought both the iPad, iPhone, and Android versions of this app right after I was diagnosed with cancer. It *was* great until the developer apparently decided to abandon it THREE YEARS AGO.   The features of the app were awesome. It's still *mostly* usable as long as you don't want to try to sync between devices or create an archive, and don't mind playing a guessing game when trying to enter dates since there's a problem that causes the date & time shown to not match the one entered. The freezes & crashes are a fun adventure as well. Will it save the info you just spent half an hour adding? Who knows!   The app made navigating my cancer diagnosis, treatment, & follow-up infinitely less tedious. It's a shame the developer doesn't care about those of us who've already forked over our money to them.",
            "Loved the app when i 1st downloaded it. Worked hard entering all of my stuff. Everything of medical records to x-rays, photos of surgery and wounds. I was in love. Ive searched everywhere for an app like this...But.. then i went to attach photos to blood work, surgery, and profile pic and nothing is uploading??? Will change review when fixed. I only downloaded and payed for because of that option. I and thousands others with the condition we share needs this app. And was going to recommend this.",
            "I really loved this app when I first got it because it had so many useful features. It still mostly functions but I've noticed some features are no longer working. One that I especially miss is attaching photos like an xray image. I still use it but worry about what else may stop working. I have to downgrade my review to three stars.",
            "I don't normally buy apps (FOR FEAR OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS)! HOWEVER, \"My Medical\" came very highly recommended by a family member. After spending well over an hour or two inputting data MYSELF because nothing would sync, I thought, \"this is absolutely pointless! Everytime I have an appointment, I'M going to have to put ALL THIS INFO IN MYSELF just like I'm doing now! Why would I pay for something like this when I have a FREE app that I don't have to put anything into!?\" REFUND PLS!",
            "This is probably the most comprehensive and the only Android app that you can import any file (PDF, Word, image) to supplement the information of each test result.   However, it still has a few of the user interfaces that it can improve."

I like the fact that it prevents you from wasting so much time at the clinic when you can easily access your health information anywhere and anytime. Very innovative and effective 👌 I found some really useful information on skin care which I never knew. On the contrary I did not find much information about women's health especially concerning menstrual health since many women go through agonising times during their period.",
            "It's simple and easy to use. It is a great app to use in situations where access to healthcare maybe unavailable. My only challenge is with the number of conditions the app addresses. Some common yet very reported symptoms like anaemia is not available.",
            "Great user interface, easy to navigate through what you need, but will be great if some medical terms can be put in a way to make it easier for us to understand... Or maybe u can add a medical dictionary for reference.",
            "Pretty good app. Quite detailed in terms of its purpose. Even though some pages take long to load (which I am sure will be solved), overall it's a good app to know more about your health."

Unfortunately, not all the courses are as informative as I'd hoped (BBP, ACLS, and PALS are good). I also wish one had to watch all videos before taking the exam(s) and that exams were longer on some of the courses (ACLS and PALS exams are good). Overall, it has some good courses, but they need to be more challenging. I rate 3 stars. That's the best I've rated on an online course."

            "I purchased the premium version of this App, as a 17+ yr seasoned RN, comparing this app to the free version of Epocrates- I'm very disappointed. I tried to write a detailed review, but there wasn't enough space. This app is difficult to chk specific drug interactions, has minimal reported adverse events, and is not as thorough in the meds mechanism of action. I sent an email through the App to ask for a refund, in detail stating the reasons why (twice). I never heard back.",
            "What cought my attention in this App is the Diagnostic Test Effect (DTE). Although not all drug contained here has DTE, however i appreciate the developers of this App. As a Medical Laboratory Scientist this App has helped me a great deal on how to advice and prepare my patient prior to when test will be conducted so that we won't arrive at false result of any kind. Although i still do some research on what i get from the App before applying it but still this App is awesome",
            "If you are in Canada, this book does NOT have the Canadian specific formulary. Also, does not allow copying text and the worse part; does not allow you to search in the page. Install it and within 1-3 days it will offer you 50% off buying the full license. But honestly, it's not worth it. 2 stars because it has an offline mode.",
            "I downloaded the free version to see if I wanted to purchase the premium. However, all of the screens are blank. I attempted to send a message to customer support, but it will not allow me since I did not buy the premium version. Now I will definitely not buy the premium version since you have to pay to ask a question. Ridiculous.",

Right now only morning and evening and certain ones at both. It would be nice if they had a way to highlight the meds, like green for day and red for night and grey for both...Something. My memory is toast! Thank you RxSaver! You've saved me a ton for recently losing my insurance! Kudos to your team and keep up the fantas",

Including Martin Sheen's Single Care. That one had the highest cost. Am saving again on Rx #2. $5 lower on a $45 prescription, but probably will go even lower!!!",

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "The App very easy to use. And the experience with ROKiT Telemedicine is priceless.",
            "Every doctor I have has been great and understanding! Saving me to hassle of waiting for a doctor’s appointment and helping me get what I need to help me even faster! My insurance guarantees that every visit is free which is even better! No office visit costs, just cost of medication! You will not regret downloading it!",
            "With my insurance I have a $0 copay. I’ve met the most understanding and educated doctors. They truly listen to me, and take time out of there day to explain things. I’ve used this app for appointments probably 10-20 times now for everything from pink eye to emergency refills. They can always send in orders for bloodwork or testing at facilities like Quest if needed. Never had problems with prescriptions not being filled at my pharmacy. This place saves time and money!",
            "Very pleased with the service. 5 minute wait time. No lines or having to wait in the waiting area with numerous other sick people. The doctor was very pleasant and informative of my issue. I was even able to stay in my pajamas for my visit! So much nicer then having to go in to the clinic. I give them a 5 star all the way!!"

            "I wish the app covered the amount of any given substance that may be dangerous given a dog or cat's size, health status, etc. I understand they don't want to discourage humans from seeking help when they should, though. One thing I do think should be changed: \"tylenol/acetaminophen\" is listed separately from \"pain relievers,\" and since it comes later alphabetically, a human checking the list of toxic substances could stop at \"pain relievers\" and never see the information they need.",
            "Very informative! I really appreciate the quizzes the app offers to test your knowledge and keep your skills sharp for situations where first aid is needed.",
            "Alot of very helpful information. Life saving information and more! Great app and thanks for it.",
            "🐈 A great guide for cat and dog basic first aid! 🐕 While not a replacement for proper veterinary care, this app is very well done and easy to follow, full of useful info for dealing with a large variety of problems pet owners might face - with not just facts, but also videos to guide you in performing emergency first aid properly. It even has a place to put your vet's emergency contact number for quick reference, and quizzes so you can test yourself on what you've learned. Highly recommended!"

            "Update: There was a delay and I was able to get it to work. I hope in the future they can make it so that you can still use the outdated app for a period of time after the update is pushed to avoid the issue of downtime. Original Review: App won't let me into the main menu. Keeps saying that there's an update and redirects me to Play store. Once I'm in Play store there's no option to download a newer app. I think the service is great but this error keeps happening so I can't use it.",
            "Great way to get prescriptions for issues already known to you. I'm sure they're helpful in diagnosing new issues as well. Definitely great for someone with a busy schedule.",
            "I tried a different app like this one and didn't like it at all it didn't work. so I researched and found this one, I have nothing but good things to say. My experience was way better then I expected, dr. Peppercorn was awesome, he is very knowledgeable,explains everything, makes you feel comfortable, listens to you, he cares, follows up and answers all questions quickly. He has made my experience great and I will use this app again if I need to and hopefully I get to have him again as my dr.",
            "This is awesome! Since everything is slow right now (COVID) I looked into online options. Right away they were able to tell me if they accepted my insurance and estimated my copay. I answered a few simple questions regarding my symptoms and after discussing a treatment plan with the doctor, I was able to pickup the medications prescribed at my local pharmacy next day. SO fast and easy! I will be using this anytime I need a derm.",
            "Update: Maybe it's not a scam afterall. Finally got some medication 14 days later and 38 days later for the other meds. The\"visit\" is text message format and lasted about one week because of approx. 24 hour delayed responses from skymd. Refused to refill my script I've been using for years and they never responded to the pharmacy, resulting in no medication for two weeks. It's $90 for each visit because insurance companies don't cover e-visits. If you can wait a month for meds, go for it."

It displays on Google Play as a free app. The $100 charge came as a surprise. Of course the designers KNOW they are being deveptive or they would display the cost up front. Instead it's in the terms you don't see unless you click to read the additional info. I'm sure they know most people don't do that so they get you by advertising as a 'Free' app. Get something honest.",

It is impossible to make it work, it will constantly prompt me to install an update even though there are no more updates available and won't let you continue. I've re-installed the app several times and even contacted the support line - still same issue.",

Update: I have gotten into the app now; however, every time I want to go into the app for any information I have to log in and it doesn't like my password that I know is correct. So essentially everytime I use the app, I have to reset my password. Total waste of time.",
            "I was enjoying using this app, but about a month ago I tried to log in and it said I no longer had access. I tried logging in a few more times and kept getting the same result. I even tried making a new ID in case that was the problem, but it wouldn't let me do that. When I called, I was told this was an \"ongoing issue with no resolution date\" and that my best bet was to try logging in every day and hope it works. Um... It's already been a month, I'm not going to log in every day and hope",
            "This app is incredibly frustrating. I've not been able to sign in, despite already having a username and password. It keeps stopping the sign in process at a screen that explains why they use healthsafe ids, but will not go any further than that. So far, I have not even gotten to use the app because it won't let me sign in.",
            "Good source of info, but very short weekly videos. The app has log in failed 80% of the time, very frustrating! Im afraid I wont be able to access my notes if I ever go into labor."

Risk assessment section - Here, there is an image guided assessment and an eventful feedback regarding whether or not the user of the app has a risk for developing liver damage. It ends by providing a direction for the user on what to do.\r\n\r\n2. Diet and the liver  section - gives advice for patients and health professionals regarding the best diets for liver diseased patients in general and for specific liver conditions.\r\n\r\n3. BMI - One of the rapidly developing causes of liver damage and injury of overweight or obesity. You can assess this simply by inputting your weight and height.\r\n\r\n4. Patient portal - This section deals with patients that would like to understand the implications of their abnormal liver blood tests. Once your LFTs return from the lab, take and look at it and you could by walking through leading questions, ascertain the likely reason for the abnormalities. This is intended to make your consultation with the doctors fruitful and not to replace the doctor.\r\n\r\n5 Healthcare portal - A lot of my colleagues and other health professionals do really need to understand and interpret \"abnormal LFTs\". This section seeks to answer this question and leads you within a minute or so to decide the next best strategy in regards to investigating abnormal liver function tests.\r\n\r\n6. Liver Blog and Video portals are going to be updated frequently and the most rapid developments and news in regards to liver conditions and hepatitis would be available here. Do check these sites regularly for news and updates.\r\n\r\n7. I have included the share button as well, as you might find it easier to send this to your colleagues and other co-workers this way.\r\n\r\n8. Common Liver Diseases: This section takes an in depth discussion and display of premium contents, with desire to educate anyone with keen mind that desires to keep informed regarding specific liver diseases, keep records, know about  our profile as well as email us directly for support.\r\n\r\n9. Liver Care Tips - Within the Specific Liver Disease section of the Common Liver Diseases are 4 large categories. These contain advise on how to keep a healthy liver, fatty  liver diseases, Hepatitis and cirrhosis.\r\n\r\n10. Liver Game -All work and no play makes a serious mind unproductive. This section aims at testing your knowledge of liver diseases, whilst at the same time get you to gain  some continuing medical education points  aimed at supporting your career.

I have been using this app for over a year now and will go to it for almost anything from an ear ache to muscle cramps, infections, stomach aches, the flu, head colds, you name it and this book with have the natural cure for it.",
            "Careful, reviews here were bought. Check other apps of phytotherapy and you'll find the exact same words. That aside, I still don't suggest this app, nor for beginners or professionals. For beginners there're way too many technical terms just to fill in the page. For professionals we know there'rre A LOT of danger with what they're mentioning regarding the method on how to use the plant. Cut the leaf and ingest it? What part of the leaf? How many? Unless you know what you're doing, don't risk it",
            "I have had this app several months now, I check with this app whenever some new illness or health issue arises. This app should be in every phone because doctors won't tell you \" fix yourself \" , with common products found in many homes , to solve your problem . After all they are in the pill prescription business",
            "Having studied herbalism and alternative medicine for decades I expected something more from this app. The list of herbs, while lengthy, omits a number of extremely important and useful herbs while including some that I have never heard of. Some of the recommendations are more like old folk cures and again, omit proven useful herbal remedies. I would not rely on this app for anything.",
            "I gave it 5 starts because it really is a rather comprehensive beginning herbal app. If you know nothing you will come away knowing enough to get you started. It also very well organized, which definitely supports learning. If you know most of this it is a great reference for common ailments and herbs."

            "This app has changed the game for me when it comes to going to the pharmacy. Whenever my girlfriend sick (or myself) I just put in the symptoms and it gives me medicine that will help with every symptom I have. I'm no longer having to buy five different medicines at the same time. Not only that it gives me the location where this medicine might be my local pharmacy. And the prices so I can go get the cheapest one. It also has Amazon prices in case I want to buy a lot at once if I need to use the medicine frequently. And unlike WebMD or something like that it doesn't make me feel like I have some rare disease, it gives me something country I can work with that actually helps solve my problem instead of worrying about it. 10/10 would recommend.",
            "Good app to spend money. I've tried some apps like this before but I found the app's benefit. This one is better than the others. My outstanding features and beyond my imagination. I really love it.",
            "Works all the time. I had a prescription that was well over $170 and OTCme saved the day, I only paid just under $11 for it! Thank you this tool! I highly recommend trying this app and seeing the difference for yourselves!",
            "Excellent software. After only a month of use it has saved me more than $100 with Pharmacy Coupon. Not only that but the app is well designed and easy to navigate. Cannot recommend highly enough. Let try it.",
            "Thanks for this useful app. I have nothing to complain about this app because this one is super great. This app is proof that the simplest ideas are the best ones. There is no fuss or hassle, just start trying new buying medicine experience"

It is also a serious problem in hospitals throughout the US and the world. In 2013, 1.3 million people were admitted to US hospitals for sepsis (#1 cause of index admissions!) at a total cost to the US healthcare system of $23.7 billion dollars (#1 most expensive condition!). Over 250,000 people die of sepsis in the US every year, more than from prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined. Despite its large toll on public health, public awareness of this condition is poor and the quality of treatment is highly variable often due to late recognition and treatment.\r\n\r\nIn sepsis, time is of the essence. Successful treatment hinges on prompt recognition of symptoms, correct antibiotic administration, and hemodynamic stabilization.

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."
