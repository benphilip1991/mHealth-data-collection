            "This app is great and the support team is fast and friendly and I'm having a bit of trouble finding the right course for me but I just downloaded it recently and there are thousands of courses so I'm sure I'll find something. I kind of wish they had courses for specific mental illnesses like depression anxiety and eating disorders though but that's the only really thing I can think of at the moment that I'd change.",

Sometimes I want to view it by the diary date, the created date, or title; depending on my use. Tried to do so just now but cannot find a way. Would be really useful if the feature is available.",
            "Such a cool app, but the problem is that I don't want to pay to be able to use certain things. I get it, that's how you make money and whatnot but still, I just want to write the entries like I would write them on a piece of paper. With everything available. Still the app is really cool and I love it.",
            "The app's pretty good, it has different themes, different emotes on each entry, and way, way, more. I'm not gonna complain that it isn't free (not all features are there cause I didn't pay for premium) cause I understand that companies have to find a way to make money. I really recommend this app for anyone who likes journaling or just wants to try it out!",
            "First of all, I would like to thank you so much for the existence of this journaling app! I have tried other apps in the past and I'm glad I have finally found this one! The themes are simplistic, beautiful and calming. And I really adore the quality of the stickers, it gives such an aesthetic touch to the diary entries. May I suggest a Web version for the diary? I appreciate the Google sync feature, but a Web version would do wonders. I can't write on the computer because I can't install the app and sync. If there's a Web version, surely I'll be able to write on the computer just as I would on my phone or tablet. And I would really love if you add more free stickers, I love them so much. So far, I'm giving it 5 stars. No ads or constant pop-ups to buy the premium. It's all very relaxing and appropriate for journaling. Keep it up!",
            "Everything about this app is AWESOME! I have to found any problems. I love how if you forgot your password you can type questions! Oh wait.. here's my actual problem.... Nothing! Also I'm so glad that there are no ads!"

            "I love it 😍 soooo much. At first i thought that it only had the default challenges, and i was about to look for another app to complement it. But then i realized that you can set your own challenges and tailor them to your exact needs. That is when i jumped for joy. I have needed something like this all my life ❤️ thank you so much and God bless you. Keep up the amazing work . Also after the 21 days are over you can restart the challenge ( with the same daily steps or change them).So flexible ☺",
            "An update. I removed 2 stars from my review for the following reasons: 1. Volume control/mute doesn't exist in settings. The ads are very jarring and come by surprise. 2. I created my own challenge, and none of the days saved. Every scratch was blank so I deleted it. Finally, a habit tracker that I actually like! I like how simple and streamlined the app is. Not hard to use. Easy to adapt the challenge to your individual needs if the suggestion for the day doesn't apply to you.",
            "A real app that you can use in life..I love the topics, the suggestions really work and you can tell it was made with very good intentions. I do not force myself to follow what comes up day by day, but I do return to all the unchecked ones and see what chances come to complete them in the flow of the day. A good balance between being in the flow and directing your life. I love it. Thank you.",
            "I absolutely love this app. I use it every day and it makes me so happy; especially the the tiny motivational and heartfelt quotes that you get as notifications every day, it's so wholesome to hear \"it's okay to be emotional, it's what makes you human, beautiful and powerful\" (for example) after a rough day ^^ i always smile when i receive those notifications and it makes me feel so much better",
            "My favourite thing is the daily little inspirational notification which sometimes comes at the best time to pick me up if my mood is not that great. I like the diversity of the challenges, the structure of them and although it might sound silly, I do like the idea of scratching a card to find out your daily task, it boosts the excitement and puts me in a good headspace to get the task done. Great job to the developers and implementers!! Also, I do really enjoy the colour scheme, very calming"

            "I love the concept of this app, however needs lots of work with detailed description for homes. And should charge more for extra living spaces. Some homes have more than one living space and even multiple dining rooms. Most customers will expect it to be included. But there just isn't enough time. Also time frames to get a job done is not enough then job will feel rushed. Size of home should be a requirement including sq feet. Also description should show before job acceptance.",
            "I'm enjoying the extra income, especially since I was in between jobs. It kept food on the table. However, I really REALLY believe there should be a distance filter. Honestly, who would drive 50+ miles one-way for a furniture assembly? It seems obvious to me. I also noticed that I get notifications for jobs that I don't have selected in my filters, and they're usually pretty far away.",
            "The two issues that I get the most are when clients need to 1. Reschedule work because they need to pick up some supplies for some work that needs to be done or they need to adjust the time frame of the work and they have a problem going to the app and doing so easil. Please update the app and make it so that the clients have some sort of tutorial that shows them how to make simple adjustments to make it easier for them to contact the handy pro that has claimed their work assignment.",
            "The app is buggy, I've uploaded my photo 20 times with no success. They expect you to carry a thermometer on you 24/7, because you have to tell them your temperature randomly, even if your just checking your schedule. When I respond that I didn't know my temperature, I was threatened with disciplinary action! The pay for the handyman stuff is... okay, as long as it's local, the pay for house cleaning is a joke... it's not a bad side job, and a great way to meet people who might hire you again.",
            "I am having a serious hard time with this app after installation. The company seems to be faceless as you can't reach anyone when you're stock. My application is still in review for months after completing the onboarding application process. I am taking my picture and watch the videos and it's just there for months. The annoying part is my the $20 which I paid so as to get started and there's no phone number or email for you to contact anyone."

        "comments": [
            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your users🖕",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

            "I can't speak to other peoples experiences, but I'm a young guy 22 and I turned this app on because I live in a place where there aren't a lot of twenty something year olds. I've gotten 3 phone numbers in like 4 days of using the app, went on a few days and actually like both of the girls. So for me the app really works! I think these dating apps are what you make of it and some people who don't get swiped right might get salty and leave a bad review, believe me it is very possible to get dates and enjoy fetlife!",
            "Paid subscriber. This seems super sketch. Not saying all their profiles are fake but the lions share appear to be. The people i talk to are a portion of the same ones from a different kink app I subscribe to. No one else has responded, or matched, and you get a sense that the profiles, and the photos don't really sync. Id rather see less people on that are real, rather than sift through lies.",
            "Unable to message, unless you pay. I bit the bullet, and got a 1 month subscription. But, since very few pay. It's impossible to communicate. Because, the person you're interested in, can't reply. What is the point of subscribing and supporting the app; when you get nothing for it? Pretty sure, most of the people in my geographical location (Pittsburgh) haven't used the app in over a month. What's the point of using an app, that most people cant use and give up on?",
            "No ads, most of the profiles seem real, and the subscription is not prohibitively expensive. The free use is ok, but it would be cool to be able to send one message a week or something to initiate contact. I would really like to see a way to search within a certain distance, and a way to apply the same filter for the swipe game. Unfortunately, there are a lot of females ' selling services ' or foot pics.The community seems to be on the small side. Overall, it's not bad, but it's not great.",
            "It's ok, same as all the others when it comes to being able to use very basic features until you pay. My issue is that I cannot scroll up through messages I receive. So if someone sends me a few messages in a row, I cannot go up to read them. It's incredibly dumb. Not to mention you cannot avoid being contacted by people way outside your preferred age range. I've had to block more people than I have spoken to. And they don't have to use a picture of their face to start a profile."

The paid subscription looks worth while and something I will need to subscribe to if I want to continue these weight loses. 5 star app for me and I believe it will help you as well. P.S. Tracking alchohol is super unique and useful as it is hard to track in other apps.",

            "5/5 a really great app. Other similar apps pale in comparison. The amount of personal customization is excellent and allows for good accuracy and actually achieving goals. All the food data is verified and accurate (a big problem on other apps)! As someone who struggles with designing meals the recommender is really useful. The calorie breakdown is a great feature. This app has a beautiful smooth design and includes many useful graphs and diagrams.",

Upset stomach, in general just wanting to b healthy. It's a great app. At least for me it is. It's worth it to check out if ur into stuff like this",

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

This will help you stay centered and calm during challenging situations.\r\n4.\tShare a little, care a little\r\nLearn to be more compassionate! The next time you or somebody else commits an error, let them off the hook without holding a grudge. Broaden your perspective that we all are evolving continuously and that no one’s perfect. This outlook will help you accept yourself and others better.\r\n5.\tPraise the one in front of you\r\nWhen we praise someone’s qualities out of the feeling of completeness, then it elevates our consciousness and brings enthusiasm and energy. It helps the same qualities blossom in us too and we become better individuals.\r\n6.\tCommunicate effectively\r\nWe communicate either through our presence or by expressing our feelings.

            "I read the content right after downloading the app. It's pretty good at first, I actually learned a lot, but, some content were cut some were like jumbled and some seemed like they lost their own places. I like the facts written there but it gets pretty annoying when the tip says \"here are some steps\" something like that and then there's nothing below. I hope that'll get fixed, if so, I'll gladly give you 5 stars.",
            "Life Hacks 2019 is a pretty resourceful app. My favorite thing about it is how the hacks are conveniently sorted into categories like Technology Hacks, Money Making Hacks, Health & Lifestyle Hacks, Food & Drink Hacks, etc. This app is very informative, nicely categorized, and easy to navigate. Keep up the good work guys.",
            "Finally!! You guys don't know how long I wanted this thank you guys so much other similar apps like these are deceptively online They needed to be connected to the internet to be able to use but with more bland design You guys have colorful much simpler design again I want to show my gratitude for you",

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people. Its amazing and even though not much people see it,I love it because its a diary for me but on the phone. Daily Life, your app is VERY GOOD"

It is a user friendly app. I have so much belief in Ayurveda, being the oldest healing science it has miraculous effects on our body. It feels great to know that there are people out there who are determined to change everyone's lifestyle by creating such motivational and knowledgeable apps. Appreciate your efforts guys.",
            "First of all, many Congratulations to the lead Dr Avantika for this great venture. Though the app works amazing without any technical glitches , the best thing about this is the *one of kind* recipies for a food junkie like me. 😋 As you won't gulp down the guilt with every bite if you follow the charts and varied satvik cusine. Another interesting features are Dincharya and diet plans. It's important to inform coming generations about the healthcare with the healing touch of Ayurveda and you are doing a superb job by bringing this here in smartphones 😍😘 Godspeed!!"

            "Push notifications declaring I have matches and should start conversation only to get in and there's nothing. Either don't do the push notifications like that until they've been there a little, or if it's bugging, fix it; I don't mind if someone unmatches but I'd rather know that's why they're not showing up so I'm not left thinking the app is sabotaging it? Definitely wouldn't spend money on it like that.",
            "Totally miserable experience. Repetitive match suggestions, they keep appearing even after I reject them. Overpriced super expensive extras. All my matches, conversations, media and settings were lost after a website update - I was unable to continue with my connections - no reaction from support. And that was a paid \"gold\" account! Complete waste of money, time and energy.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Dudes swipe right, in order to match but don't talk. It makes no sense. If you're interested in someone and match them, why be unresponsive? It is very immature and wastes everyone's time. Therefore I am giving a low rating. There's great potential, but people need to stop being immature and actually talk to their matches.",
            "Installed the app and cannot log on either with Facebook, phone or email. Constant errors keep popping up when trying to log into an existing account. Edit October 2020. Since found out I have been banned from Tinder. When I spoke to them, they will not tell me why I have been banned and they didn't do appeals. How can you ban someone and not tell them why or to even get their side of the story!!!",
            "Ive been on tinder acouple of times in the past and it was easy without and real problem or bug. I downloaded it again last night and it won't open and keeps saying \"we're experiencing some issues\". Who's messed around with it? I mean there's no actual chance of meeting anyone on there, but it was perfectly fine and straightforward before."

Not implemented?! My gas cooktop is off (I'm standing in front of it), but the app says it's on, and has some sort of animation which I'd normally expect to be some kind of \"refresh\" animation. There's no excuse for this kind of sloppiness in 2020.",
            "Simply can't connect to the appliance.... This app is ridiculous. It uses the same idiotic system used by Honeywell in which you have to connect to their Wi-Fi signal and jump through all these hoops. No matter what you do it still won't work because apparently it can't find your appliance in the cloud. This is a classic example of software engineers building something without any user testing or input. I fail to understand why companies can't just get this simple thing right.",
            "First, you're required to register and give up a lot of personal information right upfront. I hated it. It should have delayed all of these nosy questions until the app actually has a reason, like for a service appointment. Second, the temperature settings in the app disagree with what the front controls on the fridge show. I ended up disabling the wifi on the fridge. The bottom line, it should be more anonymous and reliable. The reply shows total ignorance, so it's a cultural issue as well.",
            "Horrible this app doesn't allow for anything i go through the motion of registering my appliances on the ge website. I download this app to control them and still nothing. The website says what you should be able to to do on the app but that's not the case here. I dont understand why they would launch an app before they work out all the kinks.",
            "So aggravating! I have been in touch with GE's support team, through phone calls and e-mail, well over a MONTH. No luck getting appliances connected. (A dishwasher & water softener.) So, doing some research, I found out that anything that can only utilize the 2.4 band on the router (such as this app requires) is what causes the problem with an IP address not getting assigned, or it being \"found in the cloud\". Also read somewhere this app doesn't work with the new mesh systems. GE, really???"

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

I find the app very easy to use, it's set out simple and straightforward and even has a feature where you can track your progress. If you haven't downloaded it yet, what are you waiting for?!",

Is everything I need to help me achieve and maintain my diet and exercise goals; 1000s of healthy tasty recipes and diet styles, personalised macro calculations, 1000s fun and varied workouts, trainers who are so positive and familiar they almost feel like friends. Speaking of friends the community message board is what sets this app apart from others. Couldn't live without this app now, the subscription fee is worth every penny, just wish I'd joined sooner xx",

I've lost 1 stone in 1 month, have made incredibly supportive new friends, am so much more confident in my own skin and am starting to love the body I'm in. It's so much more than a workout programme and I would encourage anyone to give it a try, you really won't regret it!",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

I like the ability to add and subtract areas if interest. They mark ads/sponsored posts pretty well. Pretty speedy on all devices, even somewhat older ones. Overall a nice news agragator.",
            "I've been using flipboard for years. Now like 80% of the content is videos. And NONE of those videos actually play. It's so weird. They have some new video set up, every time I click on a video, it doesn't play. Just black screen. Click on it, it goes to another black screen. So, two major problems rendering this app useless: 1. Nearly all news is now in the form of videos. I don't want videos. I want to read, and 2. Those videos don't even work. How do you not beta test this, Flipboard??",
            "If I open a page on source like golf or mma or something like that, I get articles that cover something else entirely. I'm really annoyed that I spend more time reporting articles that are not on topic and I don't know why this hasn't changed in years of reporting these articles... Please do something about this.",
            "Been using flipboard for quite some time since you can customize what news you see or just flip through all news. Biggest down side is tbe comment section is really subpar and broken up into different sections. Dont even bother commenting if you see 100 plus comments because your comment is lost at the bottom. Other than that is a nice app to see any news you want.",
            "Can't share URL if you click a link inside an article. Steps to repro: 1. Tap into an article 2. Tap any link on the page that goes to a different site 3. Observe the top toolbar shrinks from several items to 2 items. 4. Tap the share button in that toolbar 5. Pick literally anything on share sheet. 6. See \"Couldn't Share item\" error every time. If you fix this bug lmk and I'll revise my review! Update: Flipboard denied this obvious, reproducible bug. Smh. Bug does not happen on ios."

I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or \"extra features\" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",
            "Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!",
            "This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",
            "I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",
            "I like this app and I appreciate it. Just I have paid $2.99 for ads-removed from the app but the app still shows the ads and ask me to pay again for removing Ads!! I have already sent an email to the developer but I didn't get the response! I'm waiting for your reply as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and support. (UPDATE) I solved this issue by reinstalling the app. Thank you."

Lifestyle Tracker helps you to create a healthy lifestyle for yourself by reminding you to do important things that your body needs daily. Once your lifestyle is on track, it automatically gets your body to maintain calories. \r\n\r\nWhy do you need Lifestyle Tracker to remind you? That is because we want you to concentrate on your daily work life while the app takes care of your health and notifies when its time to eat, sleep, wake up, drink water, green tea, exercise and recommendations by experts.  You do not have to spend time to find the right things that you need to do in a day to live a healthy life. The app provides you information on everything you need to live a healthy lifestyle and stay on track!\r\n\r\nLet's be practical. How many hours do you spend everyday just to watch what you eat and note down the calories in your fitness apps? And to be honest, you cannot enter calories every time you eat something because it is a hassle. Everyone is thinking about calories counting but if you dive deep you will realize that your calories will automatically be on track if you follow a healthy life by eating regularly and on time, getting 8 hours sleep, exercising daily, drinking water and green tea for a high metabolism. We make this easier for you by reminding you on timely basis based on expert recommendations for all important things your body needs daily.\r\n\r\nMost of the fitness apps today concentrate on tracking calories count and entering food you intake.  But you need someone to remind you to do all the things that will help you maintain those calories. With this app you will concentrate your energy on eating, sleeping, exercising on time and the end result will be more than what you get through regular fitness apps. Once you get your daily schedule on track via lifestyle app, your fitness apps can be an addition and help you gain more results. You do not need to diet nor you need to invest time watching what you eat every minute, all you need to do is follow the routine when the app reminds you. \r\n\r\nThis app is especially built for office goers who are stuck on their desks for long hours and are so busy that at times they do not realize that they are not drinking enough cups of water throughout the day. While you are at work, this app gives you a soft reminder so that you do not ignore your body in your busy life.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 100 things you can do in a day to lead a healthy life but do we have the time to do all of those? We hear you. That is why we have given you the most important reminder tiles by default and have set reminders based on expert recommendations so that you are on your way to lead a good lifestyle. If you hear of more things that you think could help you in long term, then you are covered. We allow you to add additional reminders for things that you would like to set by your own. \r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to ensure that every individual creates a lifestyle for himself which includes important things to be completed from morning till night and follows it regularly. That's what we call as maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Once you are used to living a lifestyle where you do everything on schedule then your body and mind is trained in that direction.

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

        "description": "Lifestyle-related conditions are largely preventable. This App is aimed at contributing to the reduction of Lifestyle Diseases Unequivocal evidence exists that the combination of health policy at the societal level and health education at the individual and family level related to smoking cessation, optimal nutrition, weight control and physical activity and exercise, optimal sleep, and stress management would largely prevent, manage, and some cased reverse these conditions (Dean et al., 2011).  According to  Reddy (2002), less research has been conducted on non- communicable diseases according (Mensah, 2008). However, both infectious and NCD are significant contributors to the increased morbidity and mortality of South Africans.  In 2004, more than half of all deaths in SSA were caused by infectious conditions, and one – quarter by non-communicable diseases (NCD), which by 2030 NCO will cause 46 percent (Chopra et al., 2009). Majority of these diseases are related to lifestyles (Rosendorff et al., 2007)\r\nDiabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity have become major public health problems of global significance (Tsai et al, 2004, Adibelli et al 2008). The World Health Organization has predicted that the number of patients with diabetes will double from 143 in 1997 to about 300 million in 2025, largely because of dietary and other lifestyle factors (Ovayolu, 2010). Therefore, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity are the most decisive factors in terms of adversely affecting health-related quality of life.\r\nThe impact of obesity has become an increasingly important public health issue. By the year 2015 it was estimated that over 700 million people around the world will be obese, a problem of epidemic proportions that plays a direct role in chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain kinds of cancer (World Health Organization, 2008). However, obesity is estimated to account for nearly 10 percent of all medical spending in the United States. The prevalence of obesity is increasing in older adults, with an estimated 31 percent of those aged 60 years or older regarded to be obese in 2003 – 2004. The increased prevalence of obesity in older adults is especially concerning given the association between obesity and impaired physical function (Himes, 2000).\r\n With a changing culture facing an increasing number of teenagers with eating disorders, physical activity (PA) provides an opportunity to tackle obesity issues whilst restricting emphasis placed on dieting (Steinbeck, 2001). Certain social-demographics can play a role in the amount of PA a child is able to participate in. Individual, interpersonal, and environmental factors are associated with PA among children and adolescents. Demographic factors include sex, age, and race or ethnicity. Children from less advantaged minority families have lower levels of activity (Gorden - Larsen et al. 2000; Lee et al. 2002). The development of PA strategies that span from childhood through to young adulthood is of critical importance. A substantial amount of scientific evidence shows that older adults who engage in progressive resistance training and aerobic exercise are able to increase muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and bone density (Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing, Lee & Kampert 1994; Lee, Hsieh, Paffenbarger, 1995).  Furthermore, several randomized controlled trials show a beneficial effect of resistance training on muscle strength among frail elderly persons (Kannel, Belanger, D'Agostino &  Israel  1986;  Leon,  Connett, Jacobs  &  Rauramaa, 1987). According to  Keysor  (2003),  PA,  particularly walking, increases muscle strength and aerobic capacity and reduces functional limitations. When considering issues of morbidity and mortality, health cannot be compartmentalized into categories of NCD versus infectious disease. People living with HIV and AIDS are not spared from NCDs.",

            "Здравствуйте! Очень рада,что наткнулась на ваше приложение. Регистрация прошла быстро и успешно,само приложение очень легкое для использования. Позвонила в техподдержку по поводу вопроса, они отреагировали очень быстро,спасибо вам за это! Отлично провела время с семьей)",
            "Классное приложение, интуитивно понятная регистрация, легко разобраться как взять самокат в аренду. Был небольшой вопрос, но тех. поддержка быстро и оперативно все решила. В итоге шикарно покатались.",
            "Москва, Самокат 0340 дышит наладом, после горки даже не может набрать скорость, в другой момент не тормозит. Кнопка не нажимается , фонарик не выключается , турбо режим не включается. У других сервисов эта же модель отлично работает. Неудобная система с кодовым замком (но это не так важно, если бы все остальное работало), приложение виснет в совершенно не подходящий момент. Хотел взять попробовать другой самокат, при активации приложение вылетело. Приятные тарифы и бонусы, но остальное не очень.",
            "Очень классное приложение! Удобное и простое. Захотели с семьёй покататься на самокатах, возник вопрос, техроддержка быстро отреагировала, помогла разобраться, замечательно провели время!"
