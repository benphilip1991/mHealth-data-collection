            "Brilliant for tracking alcohol consumption. Really useful graph shows how pissed you are now, and information reminds you how useless you may be at your current level. Looking at that has stopped me having one (or more) last drinks when I see the estimated time to sober. The graphic is so striking it even works when you're not sober! I think I'm talking myself into contributing for the pro version! The history graphs and stats are brilliant. Only prob is no export to CSV",
            "Can't recommend this app enough. Interface is a bit complex at first but after a small amount of time it's easy to navigate, this really helps me manage and time my drinks throughout the week, helps me see how much I'm drinking and to be consistent with measurements instead of free pouring. I'd recommend fully! I also love the live time input you can put in to really spread your drink out.",
            "On the whole, I like this app despite its dated UI. What I find really annoying however is the graph showing weekly consumption. I have four 'dry' days a week and my weekend consumption varies between 14 and 21 units. Last Friday, I consumed just 1.42 units but the graph shows 8 or thereabouts. On Saturday, 5.84 units but the graph for that day shows about 42. On Sunday, 11.4 and the graph is off the scale (over 75). Whatever logic is being applied is not user friendly.",
            "Really great app for making it easy to see how much you're drinking and sticking to a limit. My only complaint if you can call it that is I wish it had a cumulative weekly figure rather than an estimate based on previous consumption.",
            "I have used for many years and find it vey useful. Some have complained of inaccurate BAC but if I correctly set up with weight and absorbtion rate it compares very closely to two different breathalysers that I own. To start your week on a Monday, simply enter one dummy drink on a sunday. It will then start new from the next day. Only issue is that if you put a weekly limit in of 14 units and drink 4 units in one day, it shows 200% of target, however weekly & monthly figures correct over time."

            "It's great and easy to use. It's not just a time tracker. It goes through the physical and mental effects from day one to 10 year. We know about hangovers and withdrawals...but do you know about cell regeneration or how long it take the neuron activity to take place? Interesting app. I wish it had an option for more reminders or different types (not just you've been sober now 100 hours...congratulations)",
            "This app keeps track of not just how many days you're alcohol free, but potentially how much money you have saved. The positive benefits to your health. A little distraction game to get you through a hard moment, and a way to track triggers so \"IF\" you are trying to do deep dives into the WHY of your drinking habits. Totally a neat tool whether you are doing this on your own, with a therapist, or through an organized group.",
            "Terrible app! Too many ads and you can't even use any of the sections such as how long since your last drink. This is supposed to motivate you into quitting slowly yet you can't even select sections such as how many days/ hours sober. Worthless! Uninstalling",
            "Really, really wish the icons for the badges were each different from the last. Takes away from the satisfaction of achievement if they all look the same (for me at least). Otherwise, love the app and you can honestly use it to track any addiction tbh"

            "Could not parse result. That is all I get from ordering from this app. Was great, no more. I figured it out. You can put any text into the deliver notes anywhere until after you push the order through. Huge design flaw for you if guest can't check out. Luckily,I work in data, so I think is silly things like testing different parts of the checkout process. Thanks for the quick response! I will change my 1 star to 4 star because it's your response time.",
            "Wow that was so easy. I ordered from a local business, was able to sort and view their inventory, shop by volume, flavor, and type of alcohol. Truly one of the easiest, most enjoyable app experiences I've had in a long time. Filling my cart and checking out was an absolute breeze. I might never go to a liquor store again.",
            "I really appreciate your service, and the only reason I'm rating the app 4 stars, instead of 5, is because the driver location update is really slow. I had a driver waiting outside my door for a few minutes because the app didn't update. I was watching the driver location the whole time and by the time it updated, he had already been waiting. This hinders other customer's delivery times. I don't want to be responsible for someone else waiting for their delivery. Please patch this",
            "Mostly works great. One suggestion I have is this: once you add something to the cart from a store, automatically sort the subsequent search and product listings pages by the items from the same store. Where the items from said store end, add a seperator and a header for items from other stores.",
            "Awesome app, so convenient. Docked one star because sometimes when I'm scrolling it will register a click and open a product page (but that might just be me?) It shows the discount codes on the home page but it would be sweet if it automatically put them into the checkout for you if it qualifies. Other than that I use the app all the time. Also have always had awesome delivery people."

I do wish there was a community space to share, search and up vote custom cocktails. Also, a different color scheme, but I'm just being a picky brat by this point. Great app!",
            "Great, simple app for managing my bar. I like that it's not bloated with copies of variations of the same recipes and that I can edit any recipe to suit my tastes. It would be nice if it came with or updated with more ingredients and recipes, while still keeping the bloat down. It's also a little unclear which recipes I created vs which recipes came with the app. Also I'd love to be able to organize recipes into lists within the app. But overall I love this app and I use it all the time! Thanks!",
            "I can't say more! This application is just amazing for new baristas. You can learn everything from here. You could add more non-alcoholic drinks though. The only problem I face is the quality of my drinks. I may know how to mix everything up, but usually whatever I make (and it has fruits in it) usually comes out \"thick\" and is not easily drunk. It would be interesting to add various general guides and tips, or videos in each drink. Thank you for your work!",
            "It has been super handy and fun to try new cocktails! I also love that it lists cocktails that you would only need one or two more ingredients for, so you know what to buy. I just wish they had a more extensive library or would add more cocktails, there are a few well known ones missing, as well as the more rare ones. Otherwise, I love it immensely!",
            "A great cocktail app to have all your favorite drinks. My only complaint is that there isn't an official \"lemon juice\" ingredient. I know I can add my own but I would have to change all the cocktails already listed for them to have lemon juice just because they don't have it on there already. This can be a very tedious job. So I would appreciate if the developers can add that on there. Also I love to use the metric system and I would love to be able to use 22.5 ml in the drink recipes."

If i make it past 2 weeks thatll be the longest sober ive been in years, also it shows health and how long it will take and progress bars so you can get a good idea of what your body is doing healing itself",

Highly recommend, it's a clever clever app."

            "Seeing progress in a statistical format gives it a bit more foundation to my mind. Numbers can be viewed as 12345 and there is no way to reinterpret \"1\" or \"2\" or \"3\", no matter what what our experience has conditioned us to BELIEVE or what varied cultures teach us, in any language \"1\" means \"1\". SO, I progress \"1\" day at a time!",
            "Most of the time I feel the app has everything as I need. It would be better if the graph in stats be improved. Currently I have mesrly 200+ entries and it is impossible to track my progress with it as the data points are too cramped to conclude any meaning ful information from it. Further, there is scope to add some more insightful representation under this section. Thanks you.",
            "I really love this app! The daily quotes are AMAZING and the fact you can track your sobriety from multiple addictions is exactly what i was looking for. I also really like the goals that you can attain/keep track of since each step feels like an accomplishment. Pay the 2.99 to unlock the entire app as well! You won't regret it!",
            "I thing being able to see the hours and minutes pass was therapeutic, especially the first week which is huge. Just having the reminders and the pats on the back. We don't get enough of that. I guess only reason it's not a 5 is there's not a whole lot to do, but it's free so..."

Unless it's just me being stupid and missing it. I'll update if that turns out to be true, but a basic feature like that should be available and be hard to miss.",

            "The idea is cool but the app itself would need some improvement. UI looks fine but the gameplay is quite boring. First steps need to be repeated for at least a thousand times to get somewhere (e.g. buy improvements). New machines can be purchased via in-app shopping options - at least at the beginning of the game. So after a while, I've lost my interest in spending more time playing with this app. 😥",
            "Paint drying simulator Takes forever to progress, tutorial is poorly done and the game practically forces you into microtransactions unless you want to spend forever doing anything",
            "After playing the game for a while, it becomes extremely repetitive. All I do is to keep on buying ingredients andpass them through the workshop. Also, the graphics aren't good. The animation also too slow that it look like the gaming is lagging.",

            "App frequently forgets the apartment number, even after having saved it multiple times, forcing me to either double check with each order or risk having to hunt down a lost driver. Document scanning is next to worthless, and either can't process images or simply won't scan them at all. App loads slowly--it can take minutes even on decent hardware. The app also does not retain information from the website version, even on the same account, despite being able to do so through the app across multiple devices. Other than that, this is a decent app--far better than some others I've found on the Google Play store. It just needs some polishing to work more consistently (and to work better with lower-end tablets and phones).",
            "The app was working fine until several weeks ago, when I began receiving a B10000 error, unable to authorize payment. It's never been fixed, so I guess it's a permanent issue and I won't be able to use 7now on my phone anymore. It's a shame because I liked the convenience, but it seems they got to it and blocked my ability to purchase. Scumbag gangstalkers that are in every city now, harassing millions of people for no reason. If you're being gangstalked ahead of this election, may you have the power to kill your stalkers! Kill these demon gangstalkers! Their families too! Kill them all!",
            "Don't ask for the customer to go through the motions of entering their payment information and then automatically default to a card number associated with their device. It's creepy and irritating. The most important part of an app like this is the payment portion. It said the card didn't work but charged it twice. Now I have to wait for said charges to fall off in the next 7 days. So stupid for that much stress.",

Great way to send a bottle to friends or to save a search for a liquor store to stop at on the way to a friend's house.

Also, wish was allowed in more areas for gifting nationwide, but that's a larger problem.",

            "Does what it says, simple, tracks your alcohol consumption in units, however all drinks and measures set, you cannot include different measures which would be a help, another review says you can add custom drinks, if this is true it needs to be clearer how to do this as I cant see this option, if you have a different size of beer or different alcohol percentage you just have to pick closest, so not as accurate as it could be.",
            "Really useful, makes you realise how much you are actually drinking. Easy to use, and tailor to your own fav drinks. I would like it even more if it gave a top 5 drinks in order rather than just fav only. Also if it had an average analysis of drinks per day as it does so for units. The analysis side is rather lacking, which is odd for a tool that's meant to help the person analyse and realise their true drinking habits.",
            "Great app, would love if you could order the custom drinks yourself so you could put your most used/favourite drinks at the top. Would also be nice if there was a reminder for if you forgot to press submit and we're about to move close the app.",

Thank you very much for reply, l don't know any other app that does the job l want.",

            "Great app idea. Nearly everything is listed with loads of informative reviews, with an easy to navigate interface. However, the problems are too prominent to ignore. The app is very laggy, sometimes freezing or crashing upon trying to click on a type of spirit. The search option is also very slow and glitchy, half the time I have to close and re-open the app if I want to search something, since half the time it doesn't work. Great app but definitely needs much more work.",
            "Great way to keep track of your tasting notes and see how your thoughts compare to others. They also have good articles that are very relevant. They need to add to the inventory on some occasions although most things are present.",
            "i last reviewd this app in 2018, gave it 4 stars. im dropping it to 1. ever since theyve incorporated the \"premium\" where you have to pay, nothing loads. distiller as a whole is very useful, but the app is now trash. stick to the web version.",
            "Great for saving your tastes/faves in one place! Love how it can (for the most part) find different liquors though the beta scanner. Debating on getting the pro version. I'm not anywhere near the connissuers in terms of tasting different flavors of whiskey, but trying to get there.",
            "Good feedback from the community, substantive content, only complaint is the search could be a little more precise. Still my go-to app for booze."

As a Programmer myself, I would have to say that this has been built very well and so far I haven't experienced any hiccups or software issues with the app. My only gripe, and this is just because I'm frugal, is the pricing of the Premium version. 4.99 just seems a lot to me to unlock basic customization options.",
            "This is the best of the quitting habit trackers I've tried. Nice simple yet classy UI, & adding motivational cards helps remember why I'm doing this. I have used it for ages so upgraded to premium for extra goals. I also like the dark theme. The only thing I would have liked in premium was maybe an added diary or notes, though I still think it was well worth my money.",
            "I expected a bit more features and options, but it's rather good. Good and easy UI, everything is clear and easy, cold figure out fast how it works. Edit: although it was logged in with Google Play, it did not back up my progress, lost everything.",
            "Awesome app!! Put off paying for the upgrade for a while but was worth it. What I like most is the calculation of time and money spent or saved...keeps me recording my slip ups and makes it so much more than just a clock. The calendar view is also really cool",
            "Really helps. In the past I've tried to quit smoking and bought a little $1 cigar to 'tide me over'... I always ended up returning to smoking. But I didn't this time because I didn't want to reset my progress. It really helps to see it. One week, no smokes for me!"

        "description": "For some people, kicking back with a glass or two of wine is just that. You’re out with friends, you pour, you sip, you get that warm, relaxed feeling, and that’s it.\r\n\r\nFor others, one glass becomes many, one night out becomes every night, and drinking starts taking up major mental space that becomes a focal point of your life.  \r\n\r\nIf you’re addicted to something, it doesn’t mean you’re weak or bad at willpower. Addiction lives in your brain circuitry — it’s not a personal shortcoming.\r\n\r\nAddictive substances like alcohol activate pleasure receptors in your brain. The more often you switch on your pleasure pathways, the less pleasure you feel over time. So, your brain will crave stronger and stronger stimuli to get those happy chemicals. Your brain grows accustomed to the stimulus after so much repetition, and over time you’re so used to it that you have to have your fix to function.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re starting a new habit or breaking an old one, success hinges upon three things:\r\n\r\nChanging your behavior – either starting a new behavior or stopping one\r\nWillpower – being physically and mentally resilient against weak moments and temptation\r\nOften you must change the way you see yourself in the world\r\nAlcohol addiction recovery is a whole different animal, but there is some overlap. Quitting drinking, specifically, has three distinct phases:\r\n\r\nDetox – get all of the nasty stuff that built up from years of drinking out of your system\r\nBecome abstinent\r\nStart the path of holistic recovery\r\nWith the understanding that you need all of these to work together, you can put together your plan to drop the bottle.\r\n\r\nMost people with alcohol problems do not decide to make a big change out of the blue or transform their drinking habits overnight. Recovery is usually a more gradual process. In the early stages of change, denial is a huge obstacle. Even after admitting you have a drinking problem, you may make excuses and drag your feet. It’s important to acknowledge your ambivalence about stopping drinking. If you’re not sure if you’re ready to change or you’re struggling with the decision, it can help to think about the costs and benefits of each choice.\r\n\r\nAvoid using the word ‘alcoholic’ due to the negative connections associated with this word. Instead, show you concerns by stressing the fact alcoholism is a disease that requires treatment.\r\n\r\nIf you feel you lack the ability to communicate your concerns in the manner, then another option is to stage a professional intervention. For a moderate fee, a professional interventionist will travel to your home in order to conduct this intervention.\r\n\r\nThis application feature are :-\r\n\r\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\r\n\r\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\r\n\r\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends,family and social networks.\r\n\r\nYou can copy the text from any post.\r\n\r\nYou can enable notification\r\n\r\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles",

First, create user profiles for you and your friends by entering your name, weight, and gender.

My only complaint seems to be an issue with the map. Trying to zoom out or scroll around the map to see where people are and what your friends are drinking is a little clunky, and often doesn't work. Everything else so far is great. Fix that bug and a 5 star review from me is in the bag!",

            "The app seems to be okay but needs some improvements like there is no help / contact us option. The app doesn't provide a option to either edit or cancel your order. I have placed an order 2 days ago and need to change the order and I am stuck now. Also the minimum delivery order amount of Rs. 4500 is a little on I higher side. Except for that the app appears neat. Caution:- the order placed 15 days ago still no revert. Re-review:- After unlock the delivery was immediately executed. Liked it.",

They need to be more compliant with the order delivery time. Otherwise nice app. Update: minimum purchase amount is very high"

            "The game is fun, but the free version is a tease for the game. I decided to pay the weekly charge and paid for a few weeks. When I wanted to cancel by subscription there is no place to stop the subscription and the game developers are no help when I tried to email them about my issue. Would recommend the game, just do not pay for the extended version.",
            "Cool content, but it's silly to pay a weekly subscription. Boxed games cost the same as a full month. $260 a year is outrageous. The free content is cool, but it's really just a teaser. Super repetitive, only fun for a few rounds. I feel like if you offered an unlock cost per pack, sayat most $8 and that pack is yours, you'd probably keep alot of users. I'd say make more, but from the looks of these reviews you gotta be raking it in from all the people who cant/forget to cancel their sub.",
            "So when I first bought the app it was $11.99 for full access and it was great. However recently they started charging $5.99 a week! Which I got charged. When I complained they refunded me my original $11.99 purchase and said I wouldn't be charged again. Just recently when I tried to play the game I was locked out of all the packs and it wouldn't let me play unless I resubscribed and I got charged $5.99 again...I will be unsubscribing and deleting this app as it is not worth $5.99 a week.",
            "Predatory monetisation system. They rely on users getting too drunk and forgetting they entered a 3 day trial, where they pay £4.99 every WEEK (not month!) thereafter. Disgusting recurring business model. Why not give 3 days access without this shady subscription strategy? Also, stop silently deleting this review. It's honest and fair. Thanks.",
            "Probably the most fun drinking app me and my friends have encountered! However, the price of 4.99 a month for premium is a bit too steep :( I wouldn't mind paying 1$ a week or even 5$ a month. Great app with a disappointing price tag"

        "description": "Alientoooh, the first global APP that allows the detection in voice and speech of the changes produced by excessive alcohol consumption.\r\n\r\nAt any time you can find out if you have drunk too much by simply using your voice and your mobile device or tablet\r\n\r\nAfter years of research and different tests, a fully functional model is obtained that detects the changes produced in phonation and speech, produced by excessive alcohol consumption, due to the effect it produces on the affectation of consciousness and reaction time . It has been shown that high intakes> 0.5 gr / l affect intellectual functioning, reaction time, coordination, reflexes and nerve transmission. High alcohol consumption is also linked to changes in speech production and phonation. It is these changes that allow the use of acoustic-phonetic and pronunciation indicators to detect the effects related to alcohol intoxication.\r\n\r\nThe system is based on the temporal and frequency analysis performed on a person in a normal and drunk state.

It has been shown that high intakes&gt; 0.5 gr / l affect intellectual functioning, reaction time, coordination, reflexes and nerve transmission. High alcohol consumption is also linked to changes in speech production and phonation. It is these changes that allow the use of acoustic-phonetic and pronunciation indicators to detect the effects related to alcohol intoxication.<br><br>The system is based on the temporal and frequency analysis performed on a person in a normal and drunk state.

Being able to get snacks or a drink or a little something I'm craving and it's at my door, at the MOST, in about 15 minutes? Amazing. Also, they're very good about paying attention to your requests. I asked one night for my driver to knock lightly, as my roommates were asleep and they absolutely did. Great company.",
            "Great service, however, the app is kind of bad. Like everything takes forever to load, especially when trying to search something. Sometimes you have to press one of the buttons multiple times for it to actually recognize that you are. It isn't deal breaking, but it is a slight announce",
            "Fantastic service with minimal fees and reasonable prices compared to other delivery services. Unfortunately my app has been unusable for awhile now. Will only show the puffer fish loading icon. Have uninstalled the app and reinstalled multiple times to no effect. It's a shame because I did enjoy using this while it worked.",
            "I really enjoyed the driver contact button and help chat button you used to have. My order is 30 min late, and I have no way except the help number to cancel my order or find out where my driver is. It feels much more impersonal, and more like another run-of-the-mill mechanical delivery service :(",
            "This app is absolutely terrible. The user experience is clunky and slow. The wait times are never consistently updated, but will always be at least 20 minutes longer than originally estimated. The prices are jacked up. Just find another way."

            "Much improved from the last app I used but two major flaws. First, shots and double shots are half sized by default, which can lead you to a DUI. You need to add custom drinks and delete the defaults if this isn't fixed yet. Second, if you want to track a friend, you must change your own personal weight, height, gender, etc. and delete your own drinks. This app doesn't yet support tracking multiple people at once. The improvements over the other app = adding a start and finish time per drink.",
            "Easy to set presets to track during a night out. Really like the average over time stats.",
            "I tried many apps to track alcohol consumption send this one is easiest to use. Default drinks are perfect and changing them when needed is easy.",

            "DL'ed this cuz of the amazing reviews - and I'm so glad! I'm getting so much more use out of it than I thought. There are SO many ways it keeps you motivated, so you never forget what you're working towards. It helps you see how much $ you're saving, how much health you're gaining day by day, and a place to enter your triggers or personal motivators. Plus like 20 other functions lol I just cannot say enough good things about this app! I paid for Pro cuz I want to support what u guys are doing ✊",
            "Excellent app. Sadly when I upgraded to the paid version I stopped getting notifications. This feature is very important to me. I'm happy to report that Mario, the developer, has been very responsive. I'm confident that he will make it work properly! I'll update this review when we get it fixed.",
            "This app really is helping me more than group sessions ever did. I find the money saved function from not drinking to be especially motivating. I'm 33 and have been drinking dangerous levels of spirits daily since my early 20s but it's time to go clean. Recommended.",
            "First app that actually shows rewards for not drinking. Shows the benefits and helps keep focus on what your goals may be. I especially like the journal. Been off booze for four days after a very stressful time in my life. You need to be personally motivated as this is just a tool for focus and reflection.",
            "It helps to have a physical view of my progress. I like that when you relapse it gives you the option to start over or keep going. I always pick start over. But it makes it easier."

Update 1st September 2020, still unable to see full month, if the 31st of the month is not visible, I am unable to record a dry day and this then wipes out my day streaks. Using a Sony Ericsson Xperia. Now sorted, if you have the phone display settings on anything above default, ie Large, the bottom line will not display. Change",
            "Was s good app initially but now it won't let me enter anything!! I just keep getting a message saying 'it looks like somethings gone wrong', so will have to uninstall",
            "Good, but too January focused. I can't track a four week period beginning in the middle of a month. Or say I want to do a dry February for example, can't do that. This reinforces harmful beliefs that taking care of your health is a periodic thing you do then stop and can only be done as part of groupthink. There are some other goals, but they are not that useful. Like 20 or 50 non consecutive dry days, what's the point of that? Edit: logged out like everyone else says. Can't log back in. Deleted",
            "I love this app, it is motivating, BUT it keeps crashing when I open it from the notification or shortcut. I have to keep going into Play Store and opening from there 😡 Update 14/1/20. So now the app has lost my login, I've had to create a new account and lost all my data - uninstalling, can't be bothered! I'll keep a check in my diary now. Rather annoyed as it has always been good in the past! 😡",
            "Every time the app receives an update you have to enter your details again and ironically since the start of January it takes ages to do anything and keeps crashing. Not what you need if you're already tense trying not to have a drink. UPDATE : now the app is failing to log me in even after a password reset. Utterly useless and extremely frustrating. (I'm actually a software developer myself and if our company released a bug laden product like this we'd be out of business)"

            "It has been a while since I last played iPuke. I used to really like the game and bought all but one expansion packs. Somehow, during the last update, they all got lost amd the app says I have not bought any expansion packs. I do not see a 'restore privious purchases' button. Is there any way to do this?",
            "Very good game, all packs are super fun and will make an awesome night. It's also not a subscription service so you're not paying 5$ a week (like other games). You just pay for what you want, I love it.",
            "Not only have I been enjoying this game since the trail came out in 2015 and has it been one of the best experiences of my life each time me and my friends play, I recently encountered my first problem when the gane updated and I couldn't access previously bought decks, I emailed the support team and a screenshot of my google play account and looking for my receipts, but the service was so amazing friendly and fast and in a moment all my problems were sorted. Thank you Ipuke!!",
            "This is a great game, although when you combine packs the points awarded can be really scewed.",
            "If you like to drink and aren't scared of life, play it. Your welcome! Love the game. Been playing for years."

Would like the option to have imperial/US calendar though, this UK/ Canadian calendar that lists day/month/year can be confusing at times. GUI could also use some updating, it's pretty plain and basic but it gets the job done.",
            "Great app. IMO needs some tweaking. I would like to have a more precise bottle size option instead of 'long neck', 'stubbie', or 'keg'. Being able to input my own bottle sizes would be good. I.e. 1 litre, 750ml, 1 pint, etc.",
            "For the brewer who doesn't need to take that much detail, this is a very good app. However if you want a more detailed app like mashing, amd and fermenting detail, check brewfather but for the novice or just hobbyist to brewing this a better solution.",
            "Useful app! The workflow takes a few minutes to get your head around buy it actually fits well with multiple brews on the go. Very cool.",

            "This app is awesome.......when it works! There have been many times it will not load an let me see adjustments being made with my groceries. Luckily for me the store contacts me personally to go over changes. However, I wouldn't expect them to need to do that with every customer. ^ Last week Today same thing...I was unable to approve changes to my groceries bc instacart was not working. My store was texting me pictures of changes being made. When I click the link it pop up a sad milk jug🤦‍♀️",
            "Great app! Easy to navigate through and they offer lots of promotions that help offset the cost of any delivery fees. Our grocery store choices are limited, so this really helps being able to pick up at places that do not offer those options in store. Also, the communication while your order is being picked is by far the best compared to any others I have used!",
            "I love Instacart, but recently the item photos do not always match with the product description. For instance, a photo will show a candy bar yet the description will say \"cat food\", and when you click the photo of the candy bar it indeed takes you to cat food instead. Very frustrating. Also, products do not always line up with the category being searched for. If I type \"ibuprofen\", I get results showing protein bars and toilet paper among the ibuprofen. My app is up to date.",
            "Unfortunately I have to drop my rating of the app from 5 stars to 3. 🥺 Since the new update 10/22/20 I don't see where you can add \"special requests\" if you don't see the item you're looking for. That option especially comes in handy when you know the store sells a specific item at the store that not be very popular. Very frustrating Please fix. Thank you.",
            "Love this! No more running to the store! I love that the shoppers keep in touch with you during shopping for replacement or to add a forgotten item. Refunds are quick and easy if there is an error, damaged item, or something is just not right...but i haven't had to use this feature much.. I also love that I get to choose my own substitutions, unlike ×××Mart, I no longer allow substitutions on most of my orders with them due to too many messed up items."

My order was delivered with 5 items to be exact missing, I contacted the app's support team and the person assisting me said the driver will be back with the remaining stuff. I driver came back with only 2 items and said the rest was out of stock. However the invoice was not amended to show that there are items missing from the order. When I called again to ask for the refund was not helped",
            "Have used the app a few times in the past month and I'm happy with it. Easy to use, refunds done as promised, delivery very fast. Have had a few \"App has encountered an error\" glitches but restores fairly quickly. It would be great if some of the product specials on the PnP site did pull through on the App and if we had the opportunity to still earn Smart Shopper points, but the daily Promos the App runs do sort of make up for it :-)",
            "Check your delivery items shown on the invoice are not always delivered, again i have just had a short delivery. (Uodate)- Much improved and no more short deliveries, best thing about this is the service from bottles when they recieve a complaint they act without hesitation and rectify the problem, great app service.",
            "Not the most customer centric app I've ever seen. Items in wrong categories. Items that are unavailable are allowed to be added to carts and paid for. Then someone calls you to tell you the product is unavailable and the transaction is reversed. The support function is copy and paste, and they couldn't care less about resolving the issues at hand. Sixty60 a much better bet."

            "The app is just Ok. Many beers have incorrect alcohol content. Custom quantity input doesn't allow decimals to accommodate brewers movement to 11.2 ounce bottles. Input of drink time is ambiguos. Does it expect the time you got the drink, or finished it? Huge difference in BAC calculations.  The app needs some work.",
            "Guys... if you \"ADD\" a drink and then remove it... it does not remove it from your BAC!  Also if you edit drink it does not update the BAC correctly.  I had to reset my night and re enter all my drinks :(   PLEASE FIX! love this app!",
            "The biggest flaw is that you log the drink time once.  When should you add the drink?.  When i start or finish? For example I took my first sip, and the app said I was almost at the limit.  This is completely incorrect.  Alcohol is absorbed over time at a rate which differs by gender.  Alcohol is metabolized at a consistent rate.  For this app to be even remotely useful you need to enter a start time and end time.  All this simulates is me injecting 2 oz of alcohol into a vein.  Useless...",
            "Very wild calculations especially after midnight.  .33 after four beers in 5 hours and 17 hours until I can drive is way off a good estimate. I do get what you are doing though so get it right."

Plus, I'm not even at work, have never ordered from work, so after a frustrating 20 minutes, I gave up. Do not reccomend!",

I installed the app on my iPhone and it works just fine. Android needs the same energy you have for iOS fresh direct",

            "As a bartender this has helped massively with both my job and home. I often make cocktails in work that are requested by customers, some of which, are off the menu and with this app I no longer have to scroll through 5 Googled recipes. At home I make cocktails for friends and family and this makes finding available cocktails with what ingredients I have available so much easier.",
            "The lack of an ability to filter for cocktails that you can make ruins the utility of this otherwise amazing app. There is no good reason for the \"cocktails by ingredient/strength/color/era\" and \"cocktails I can make\" to be separate lists. By separating them, the utility of both are ruined. If you decide, \"I want to make something strong with rum tonight\" you need to flip back and forth between the two views (3 clicks apart) and scan both lists with your eyeballs to find a match",
            "This app comes highly rated but I find it is suffering from the premium program. A lot of basic stuff is blocked unless you pay which is offered for free by other apps.",
            "this app used to be free and offer way more then what they offer now. it's ashame they used to sell random holiday based packs but now everything is locked behind a pay wall. this app is very well put together and I loved it in the past but unfortunately since coming to android from when I had it way back on my windows phone I won't be using an app I can look up recipes on google for free especially at the price this app is charging",
            "Best $20 i ever spent. In addition to cocktail recipes, it tracks what i have on hand and suggests drinks from that. It also lets you track your variations on the beverages. Im very pleased,"

Therefore it's a bit more dangerous than another calculator that has a little bit more functionality.",

Can you guys make it possible to remove drinks without resetting? Getting pretty annoying to have to reset, reenter information, and then test again. :P Just a suggestion.",

I also love how the app tells you what state laws are/where you're in violation as you go up in BAC. I'm giving this app 5 stars because it's super useful, but I'd definitely like to see more drink options added.",

It wasn't a game but it was still kind of fun to play around with the height and weight and stuff. I'm basically 15 so I don't really have a use for it, but I guess it'll help someone else."

Simply track your drinks on any occasion (e.g. Party) and watch your blood alcohol level increasing, but keep within reasonable limits! Alcohol Level Coach tries to imitate the whole process of alcohol absorption and takes several factors into account: Personal details (e.g. weight, height, age and gender), drinking speed, state of stomach, delay of absorption and custom drink mixtures. Altogether the resulting alcohol level provided by ALC should be a reasonable, but still theoretical estimate of your actual alcohol level. \r\nAlcohol consumption on a regular basis can be interpreted as addiction. This apps` goal is to raise your awareness for excessive alcohol consumption and its consequences. Find out what impact a certain amount of alcohol can have on your body and how long it takes to get rid of this poisonous liquid. Always keep in mind that blood alcohol values provided by this app are based on computation and therefore they must not be interpreted as reliable evidence for any purpose.\r\nThe purpose of ALC is to provide a theoretical alcohol level tester whereas other alcohol testing devices like professional breathalyser or an actual blood alcohol test will provide a more precise result of your alcohol level. Whenever you are comparing the results of ALC against a breathalyser, make sure you read the instructions of the breathalyser first. Usually you have to stop drinking for a couple of minutes before using a breathalyser in order to not distort the measurement.",

            "It's functional, but lacks a few very useful features like: 1. a global search, not just for a restaurant name (e.g. a particular product/dish); 2. in-app tipping possibilities; 3. an option to set favourite restaurants. The UI is also a bit counterintuitive, navigation isn't always easy and there are no customisable filters. And since transport cost is calculated depending on distance and whatnot, you could allow delivery from any restaurant - let me decide if I'm willing to pay/wait. :) Thanks",
            "Well this is the 4th time I have download this app and..when I entered my cell no...I'm waiting on the code...but no code as been sent at four time...so I can gladly say this app is not working and I have waisted my data on it...I'm very disappointed..so I will give it a thumbs down.",
            "delivery time is always much longer, ETA changing randomly every few minutes. Food was ready in 4 minutes delivery for 1.5 km takes 45 minutes... ETA is 10 minutes, 8, 10, 7, 12... car on the map jumps to start position and freezes for 10 min, jumps to half way... ETA 7 min... 8... And very hard to find food in app - shows restaurants in unknown logic - only circlek and restaurants on another side of city... where is nearest ones?",
            "I like the app better than the rest,worked fine for me so far, i like that the delivery is not that expensive. One thing i would add: the ability to tip the person who delivers via the application. I usually like to tip but lately i don't have cash available.",
            "Love this app. It's great that so many restaurants deliver to my location. I just wish there were some promotions and coupons for free delivery or discounts for users like me who order so frequently..."

Originally I left a more informative review hoping that the developers read it and address the issues with the app. but after seeing that my complaints are identical to those posted here more than a year ago, I just have one thing to say : the android app sucks, there's a reason it's got a 2 star average, and there's a 30% chance that it'll work on your phone thoug!

            "Absolutely fantastic App. I have a very well stocked home bar and have tried every app to keep track of what I have and what I can make. This by far is the best one out there. Easy to use. I can view/change/update everything on my cell phone and my guests can view everything on my tablet in the bar/man cave. Perfect for my needs. There are only a few things that would make it even better, however 5 stars for the best app out there. 1. More cocktails either by default or maybe extra \"bundles\" to download. (Heck, I'd be happy to purchase these bundles for a few bucks). 2. Some type of mirrored web version to add / view. Typing in my own custom cocktails and ingredients on my phone takes FOREVER! 3.

        "description": "This health education App explains the physiological effects of alcohol on the developing brain. A 7 minute video with captivating 3D animations, voiceover & graphics, takes you on a guided tour of the anatomical structures of the brain, to educate about what happens to specific structures in the brain when alcohol is consumed in excess. This information will equip the viewer to make informed choices in relation to alcohol consumption. The anatomical brain structures include the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, medulla, frontal lobes, hypothalamus, & nerve cells. We take a look inside the developing brain, to examine the effects alcohol has on these structures as they grow & develop, & how the physiological effects of alcohol can produce behavioural changes.\r\n\r\nWe also examine BAC, or Blood Alcohol Concentration, & how you can estimate what your BAC might be when consuming alcohol. After viewing the video, to assist your understanding of this topic, you can complete a Quiz consisting of 20 multiple choice questions. The Quiz includes an optional \"Hint\" button which enables you to review the portion of the video related to the question. However if a \"Hint\" is used to answer the question, the maximum score out of 1 for a correct answer will be .5.  You also have the option to Tweet your results to others.\r\n\r\nThis video was originally produced for a target audience of 18-25 year olds, however it contains valuable educational information for all ages. This App can be used by parents & teachers to educate a younger audience on the dangers of excess alcohol consumption. It can also be used by undergraduate medical, physiotherapy, health science, nursing, pharmacology & exercise science students to understand this topic. Additionally, health professionals can \"Airplay\" this App to youth health education groups, following up with a group discussion on the Quiz section.\r\n\r\n2013 Winner - Gold Communicator Award\r\n2012 Winner - Queensland iAward (Innovation)\r\n2011 The Global Awards - Finalist \r\n\r\nBackground to this production:\r\n\r\n3Dme & the Australian Lions Drug Awareness Foundation (ALDAF) share a common vision to improve the targetting, quality, accuracy & reach of drug awareness educational initiatives. This relationship was formally recognised by the Gold Coast Mayor when he awarded 3Dme the '2010 Mayor's Corporate Social Responsibility Award'. In 2011 3Dme company founders Luke & Sonya Brannelly were presented with the Dr Harry Jenkins Fellowship Award, which is the highest recognition Lions Clubs International can bestow on an individual for outstanding service. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the Australian Lions Drug Awareness Foundation (ALDAF) www.lionsclubs.org.au/aldaf is:\r\n- To promote awareness & prevention of abuse of alcohol & other drugs especially the factors predisposing it\r\n- Develop education and prevention activities, especially in local communities \r\n- Participate in campaigns in line with the aim of the Foundation\r\n- Actively promote and support counselling and rehabilitation programmes.\r\n\r\nMore products available on 3Dme Store http://store.3dme.com.au/\r\nStock Footage\r\nStock Images\r\nLearning Clips\r\nLearning Modules\r\nApps and iBooks",

            "This is a useful way to see if you are ok to drive after drinking. The app has an extensive collection of alcoholic drinks with their alcohol percentage quantities. All you do is enter what you drank, how much and what time and the app tells you if you are sober at the time of the query. You do have to enter your personal body characteristics so that the algorithm can be correctly applied to you. Nice job developer!",

If you could just type the measure in that would be better. Also, if you log a drink several times it would be better if you could just store presets rather than having to reselect from the same annoying sliding bar or you could just set the bar to the same as the last drink logged.",

            "I'm a real person, finally an app that actually helps...not just track your drinking, a few I tried were complicated! I just started..love it.  I do wish it had a place where you could put how much you spent...so you could watch savings.  But not like the other apps that only do it by each drink... You should be able to put how much you spent whether 1 or a 4 pack of wine or 1 bottle. :) Thanks for creating this! Xo",
            "I've been using the app for several weeks now and find it useful, but the user experience could be improved.  Here's a few suggestions:  - When tracking a drink, once you change the type of drink, the date and time resets to current (from the one that was chosen beforehand). This is very impractical when tracking yesterday's drinks, for example.  - ‎The volume slider gets frustrating very fast, as it's difficult to set the exact round number. Clicking on the volume value does nothing. Instead, this could be an input field to enter a numeric value manually - much faster and precise than fiddling with the slider.  Other than that, a very good app."

If I then add a second beer, it treats it as if my body didn't metabolize any of the first and estimated my BAC at 0.1 - which is fine, because it's just a spot check and not a breathalyzer or anything - and it's better to estimate high. It's not bad.",
            "I will update it to 4 stars based on the response from the developer, and possibly update it to 5 stars after the next time I get to use it for it's intended purpose. The fact that you can enter custom drinks, which I didn't see on my first use, is definitely a plus!",
            "Works well. One suggestion, if I'm out drinking and I order a mixed drink, it's usually done by 1 ounce mix ratios. I have not a clue how many ml that would be. Sure I could look it up, but the likelihood of me actually doing so after 2 drinks is pretty minimal.",

            "Outstanding! This app has (nearly) everything you need. The filter menus are superb and have an app that you can filter by type of cocktail, base ingredients and by alcohol type is amazing. The only thing I would add is being able to add favourites and have a section for your own personal cocktails too. I like to experiment and would love a section where you could submit your own recipes",

L’application s’appuie sur des techniques de soins validées scientifiquement, basées sur des méthodes motivationnelles, thérapies comportementales, l’utilisation d’un journal de consommation, le suivi régulier et les informations ciblées. \r\n\r\n\r\nLES FONCTIONNALITÉS DE MYDÉFI\r\n\r\n- Carnet de consommation d’alcool : Chaque jour, renseignez votre consommation journalière d’alcool ;\r\n- Graphiques : Analyser l’évolution de la courbe de votre consommation, depuis le début de votre inscription ;\r\n- Conseils personnalisés : Recevez des conseils personnalisés en fonction de votre consommation d’alcool ;\r\n- Un soutien quotidien : MyDéfi vous soutient quotidiennement pour vous aider à reprendre le contrôle de votre vie ; \r\n- Pistes de réflexion : MyDéfi vous aide à mieux discerner le lien entre la consommation d’alcool et les effets négatifs qu’elle entraine, et inversement, le lien entre la diminution de consommation et l’amélioration de nombreux facteurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOURQUOI UTILISER MYDÉFI ?\r\n\r\nLa consommation excessive d’alcool est responsable de nombreuses complications, physiques, psychologiques et sociales. L’arrêt total de consommation est parfois indiqué, mais n’est ni nécessaire ni souhaitée pour tous les consommateurs. Une diminution de consommation permet de réduire les risques de complications ainsi que les effets négatifs liés à la consommation excessive. MyDéfi vous accompagne dans cette démarche qui vous permettra de reprendre le contrôle de votre vie.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENT UTILISER MYDÉFI ?\r\n\r\nMyDefi peut être utilisé indépendamment ou en association à une prise en charge médicale. Votre seule tâche sera de renseigner, chaque jour, la consommation d’alcool de la veille. Des messages personnalisés et des conseils divers vous seront donnés. \r\nAppropriez-vous ces messages et ces pistes de réflexion, et adaptez-les à vos besoins pour pouvoir avancer.\r\nSi vous êtes suivi par un médecin, vous pourrez lui montrer l’évolution de votre consommation via MyDefi.",

            "I really have nothing else to say. The app is a lost cause. I made a point many years ago when the app was first launched about the app kept messing up the syncing process between the quantity or record of a wine entry with the record at the database server. This problem was never fixed! Today I found the same error with the quantity of a wine I have just couple days ago, and I found the quantity of the wine was unchanged. Can u trust a tech company can't even get its database syncing right?",
            "This should allow two ratings. For looking up wines and getting descriptions and reviews, this app is great. You can even take a photo of the label and most of the time it'll find it. This has kept me away from accidentally buying sweet wines (not my gig). Love it for this use. Then I used Vivino for ordering wine - I have done it twice. Once the order was placed and weeks later it didn't ship. No notice why or if it would be shipped. Cancelled that. Later I tried again, ordering a case of one of my go-to wines from a different sub-retailer in Vivino. The order was shipped in a very reasonable time this order, but upon opening it they had substituted for the entire case with a different wine. No warning, just did it. Were it one bottle, I would be (only) ok with this, but for a case, without warning, this is unacceptable. The thing that has ended my ordering on Vivino is that, having had this happen, I can't get Vivino to even answer an email or respond to the 'contact' tab on their site. I frankly don't know if anyone works there anymore, certainly nobody is manning the email address or contact input. I have reached out both ways for the third time today and will be calling the credit card to have the charges reversed.",
            "Why only 4 stars?! The application is good, pretty sure I'll use it for several times, but the 1st thing I noticed, that the tutorial after the \"see how it works\" button is completely unreadable (at least for me it is..). Light brownish background with small grey text. Please take into consideration to change it. :)",
            "Love it and recommend it often. It's a great way to broaden your palette. I've tried so many new wines based on a decent rating and generally been happy I did. Also helped me to avoid a few bad ones.",
            "Used to be a good app, but now it's just annoying when it takes over your screen to install a non-existent update, that usually comes along a week after the first red screen appears. Suggestions to remove the annoyance have gone unheard (contacted via the app)"
