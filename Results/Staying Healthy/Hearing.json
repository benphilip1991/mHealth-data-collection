            "I was impressed with this app! I expected it to be another cheesy app falsely advertising like the majority off apps out there. To my surprise it did exactly what it said, better even. I was able to hear ALL sounds, much better and louder than I figured. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who needs it.",
            "Bad ass!!! I can LITERALLY hear everything!!! Perfect if you're looking for that, \"fly on the wall,\" effect on something happening a couple rooms away with a loud ass football game and music on. I could still hear a whispered conversation in that environment I just described up above.",
            "**My actual rating for this app is 4.75 stars** The app does an amazing job of picking up and amplifying the sounds in the area your device is located! Not only was I gifted with super-human hearing but it gave me a measure of clairevoyancy (predicting future occurrences fairly accurately) as well...let me briefly explain. Using this app I was able to tell, with practice, who was approaching my room, who was ordering food in the next room and who was about to enter the house.",
            "So, I guess if you're looking to go deaf by listening to all the high-pitched sounds you DON'T want to hear while not being able to hear ANY of the sounds you might actually WANT to hear, this app is for you. As a chauffeur for a limo company, I had planned to use it to amplify the voices of my soft-spoken clients when I am in the larger vehicles. Yeah, right! That will not work!",
            "At times, I use this app multiple times a day. I only gave it 4 stars regarding my timing because there is no warning as to when I'll get next to another device n I'm suddenly wondering about the loud screech that's blinding me. Not to often but does happen."

So it is not any good to watch TV as all you will hear is echos and delayed voices which means when watching their mouths and scenes does no match what you see. Be ok to leave your device next to others to hear better but delayed Shame, would be a good app if they get rid of the DELAY .I won't be using it but if that gets fixed be good.",

            "Excellent for the hard of hearing This is a great app for those times when I forget to bring a spare battery and my hearing amplifier goes dead. The sound is accurately reproduced and not garbled at all. Like every other hearing app, there is a lag of about a second, but this can be overcome by using a BT headset or plug-in headphones. With both ears covered, you don't notice the lag nearly as much.",
            "I tried other apps. This one's the best. My 91 year old mother spent most of the day in urgent care because she's lost most her hearing. Could not have a conversation and TV was so loud it would drive me out of the house. I put the ear buds in her ear and she could hear me talk in a normal voice anywhere in the house. TV is perfect for her on setting 9 instead of 40. She perked up and smiles. She's like she was 10 years ago. Thank you"

This app is designed only to be used for safety purposes only.\r\n\r\nThis app will turn your Headphones into Noise Un-Cancelling Headphones which will allow you to hear background noises and Car Horns while listening to Music. Now you can use your headphones in public places without worrying about safety. This app can also be used as a hearing aid if anyone with hearing loss\r\n\r\nThis app works like Quick Ambient Mode in Galaxy Buds where you can briefly hear your surroundings without turning the music off completely.\r\n\r\nThis app also improves your hearing ability to hear audible sounds more clear and loud directly into your ears.

            "Juat trying it out but I know having audio on blast while talking to someone and/or walking around traffic is something that irritates or endangers yourself. Having an app that keeps you connected with the world is something that might save my life and will keep me in tune with my surrounding environment. So far I'm able to listen to my music and hear someone speak to me. It picks up on things as small as my breathing and relays it through my earbuds so I can listen to my music and hear someone.",
            "This app works amazingly well. It seriously kills all background noises completely & allows me to hear other sounds. Very impressive. Only downside which is the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that you can NOT turn it off at all. Exiting the app won't do it, closing the app won't bit even killing the app. Literally the only way to turn it off is to uninstall it & then I have to reinstall it again when I want to use it again. Please fix this please thank you",
            "This is good but is missing a killer feature, boost mode. If I wanted to I could use this as a hearing aid, but only with the current settings set to their absolute maximum. The option to go even higher would allow one to use this app to help with hearing in a pinch. Haven't seen an app with latency this low on the store.",
            "I was almost disappointed that I couldn't find any app that can produce ambient sound since the one that came with my A7 doesn't work with my ear buds and boom! I found this. This is almost close to the real thing. However a boost to volumes would be nice also, add the Bluetooth microphone options and make the sound match the frequency of it's recoding. Thank you for such amazing app.",
            "Does as advertised, lets u hear surrounding sounds while listening to music on your headphones/earpiece. There is gain control to regulate amount of background noise you hear which is nice. Only gripe is that the app uses the phone mic as opposed to the Wired/Bluetooth earpiece mic, rendering it useless if i want to be able to hear ambient sound while on the go while listening to music at the same time."

But the biggest thing I noticed while using the app was that for devices using bluetooth it wouldn't pull audio from it but instead the phone itself. Presenting unnecessary sounds when held in a pocket or other spaces. If it were possible to input an option for which mic to use that would be fantastic.",

            "It's a great boon to people like me, who need a hearing aid. This app is a great one. But off late, I changed my phone fro Lenovo to Samsung A10S, and I am not able to hear once the mobile goes on standby mode. Could you please suggest a solution?",
            "Excellent app - I rarely bother to rate apps but I felt like I needed to.",
            "This app offers a wider spectrum of frequency to base it's EQ on. With the Ear Booster hearing amplification application, you can calibrate your phone and effectively pinpoint even distant whispers ,when done correctly. Think of this app like the \"PREDATOR\" movie heat vision .Each iteration of frequency offers a different EQ to customize. You can use a Bluetooth headset and use the built in microphone physically located on the phone as your input location. This app is the best I've found yet",
            "I don't know if I can recommend this app, even though it works really well.  The things that discourage me is that 1. It doesn't appear with my applications, which I normally associate with dodgy software.  I had to look up the app on Play Store again and uninstall it from there.  2. It runs on my phone continuously, even when the app is closed.  Enabling noise cancelling activates the sound boost instead, and when I make or receive a phone call, it also boosts the volume of my voice and the sounds around me.",
            "it's nice that I can hear some things but I can only here muffled sounds even with said \"noise maker\" directly in front of me. Also, I attempted recording like it says possible. However, there are no audio files no matter where I look or any other sort of file that can produce sound."

            "I really like idea .. but can it actually replace pure tone audiometry(although bone conduction not possible)..if yes then even paying a premium shouldn't be a problem Since we are using frequencies , what about monosyllables and checking speech reception threshold , speech discrimination score, sisi score, tone decay test. It doesn't need to be the exact thing ..just something that could be performed easily on opd hours as a screening",
            "There are no instructions! Do I hold down 'I Can Hear\" until the beeping stops or tap for each beep? Do I have to hit 'I Cannot Hear' once the beeping stops or can I just stop pressing 'I Can Hear'? When do I hit the Barely Audible button - when the sound is actually barely audible or is this just a badly named Confirm/Next button? Also I would prefer to use the Hide Results option but you cant pause. If I go into settings to select Hide Result, I miss beeps.",
            "Works good. But the results can be deviated to the better ear thresholds if the person has asymmetrical thresholds. For eg. left ear has severe and right has normal hearing , the app displays erroneous results in poorer ear. Any suggestion for presentation of noise to better ear to avoid its participation?",
            "This is wonderful, easy to read and use. it's results are closely accurate too. However I would suggest that naming of files should be enabled in the app to aid file differentiation. Thank you."

            "Hey there. This app works quite well BUT I actually came looking for a noise cancellation app. People spend tons of money on headphones that cancel noise. If you managed to get even half the quality of some of the products out there, so I can achieve noise cancellation from my phone, I would happily pay $5-10 for that app. Is it possible to achieve this by reducing latency to sub 30 ms and phase cancelling? Who knows, might give you a whole new use for your app!",
            "This is a very good app i like it with cheap dollar tree head phones makes a lot of ecose but with bluetooth head set it is very quality its good with either i give it 5 stars",

After adjusting each frequency for both ears, the app asked if I wanted to apply the changes to the devices. I tapped yes and I had to pull the hearing aids from my ears. The app had set the volume controls to max and I got feedback whistle. 2. The hearing aids were new to me and caused me to make high frequencies too loud. Using earphones instead helped me set up the devices much better.",

            "It works except... Big problem is sound latency. It makes conversion difficult because the sound is behind by about 1/2 seconds. You also have to turn it off to say anything because the sound latency make it very difficult to speak. And it is difficult follow other people when they speak because their lips are out of sync with the sound. Fix this and it would be a 5 star rating.",
            "Super ear allows me to experience the best of the best audible clear sounds. With ear scout new equalizer setting hearing to little sounds becomes more easy. No dealy or such thing occured. Definitely going to use this application for a very long time.",
            "I've used many hearing aid apps, this hearing aid application is one of the top hearing applications I've ever found. I was looking an app to enhances my hearing quality. Highly recommend this hearing aid application. Thank you!",
            "I was trying to test it with you tube. The only thing that I could get to work was the volume. I have aux out to a nice pair of gaming headphones with the mic switch off. Everything else like the EQ settings, the bass, the 3D, none of that worked. Furthermore I was getting this app to try to boost the upper mids and highs in my right ear. No panning option available. I'm on a Galaxy S7, that is optimized and updated often.",
            "App works well, except shortly after my screen locks it stops working entirely until I turn it off and back on again. Would be 5 star if that didn't happen."

Thanks to all from the bottom of my heart for this app. You have changed this old woman's life for the better. I can now hear when my grand babies say I love you.",

            "I loved the app at first because I could listen to the birds really well with it. But then it had begun to get really staticy and hard to hear the birds singing. It was peaceful while it lasted.",

But the coolness goes away quick when you start to notice the latency(audio delay) between the source and your ears. Meaning when someone talks there is like a second and a half delay from when the person talks and you hear it. Its kind of weird."

The ad should either fade up to give you time to adjust the volume or the volume should go back to whatever it was before you activated the listening function. I did buy the no ads upgrade after that experience. But seriously this did cause a little hearing damage and might badly startle someone who is driving...",

The app description should state this deficiency.",

            "Downloaded 5 similar apps, only this one is simple, reliable and clear, the rest either volume too low, delayed or echoing. Only problem is when the phone was rotated the app stops immediately. If without this issue, this is a 5 star app! Screen turns off the app still works, this is great. My 108 years old grandpa needs this with a Bluetooth headphones to have a normal conversation with us, loved this more than his hearing aids.

I personally beleive the \"cardio\" helps to link still intact hair cells in the ear to synapse nerves that may have been damaged. Definately worth the 2 week trial. Use it everyday, at least one hour per day. You should see a good result!",

Admittedly I wasnt using it everyday, but even 4/5 days a weeks ended up helping my hearing. Def worth a shot and there's a free trial too. Hoping this keeps improving my hearing.",

            "I have the Signia rechargable hearing aides They work great except for one major problem. They will not let me use my phone to make or receive calls or listen to music without an external speaker. I do have the speaker but it would be so much more convenient for direct connect to my Pixel phone. This app has not been updated in over two years. App will not let me raise volume in only one hearing aid at a time. Frustrated. Thank you Kristine Drumm",
            "When I first got these hearing aids they I worked well. I just had to get used to them. The app that was put on when I first got them allowed me to change the volume separately for the left and right ear. Now the app appears to just change a general sound for both sides. And no you can't just change the volume and think it's going to be the same on each side because it isn't",
            "10/18/2020, I've done everything Signia via email recommended and this app simple does not work. Had my hearing technician reset the app again and still the app will not work. The app simply does not work. It would be very professional of someone if you can get the app working correctly. Please advise what to do. I have a Samgung A50 phone. Thank you. 3/17/2020 Follow up, STIll not working. I followed your advice, didn't solve problem. I would appreciate some help.",
            "bluetooth. compatible is only for iPhone which doesnt help android users. It shouldn't be hard to be able to have a bluetooth compatibility and in always on the phone and this would help out tremendously for the ones that actually prefer androids over iPhones. sorry but not many of us like iPhones as it is. I shouldn't have to buy another phone because of my hearing aids that I pay out of pocket for and have to pay out of pocket for an iPhone as well.",
            "Switching from 1 to 2 is easy. Volume control also works well. Further control such as area covered is nonexistent. You can't direct the sound as you want and eliminate the extraneous sounds from all other sources. For me #1 is useless as it is ruined by any outside source. I find I am restricted to #2 solely. Big disappointment."

            "Update 10/9/20 Upgraded to Galaxy S10+ . Now the app only sees 1 of the aids. Troubleshooting is useless and Oticon does not have a Support number. Sad my hearing remains diminished! Won't pair with Bluetooth I use a Samsung Galaxy S5 mobile and a Samsung Chromebook Plus. This app just will not pair with Bluetooth no matter what I do. I remove and re-insert batteries, turn Bluetooth off and on again...nothing works. The user manual does not say much about this and only references Apple IOS.",
            "I very much like the funtionality but this app is terrible with its BT connection. Pairing to my LG (less than 2 yrs old) is extremly difficult and unreliable. I dont belive Oticon is properly supporting android users like it does with apple phones. Also the BT connection to the TV is not reliable. Also why cant you stream phone calls and music without the need for the connect clip, which is awkward to use??. Apple users do not need a connect clip.",
            "Hi, I've used this app for about 2 weeks now and would like to leave some tips and requests to its product team. My phone, Android, is a Samsung, less than 1 year old. 1. the app does not capture accurately the battery usage and loss. The % of use does not decrease daily. I get a replacement notice only when it is basically dead, when the device beeps. 2. the Hearing Fitness area also does not capture accurately the hours I use the device. For most days, it counts much less time than I used it (for instance, I use 10 hs and it counts 2hs.). It would be nice to see these two features working well. Thanks.",
            "The app is nice. Works fine on my Samsung Galaxy J5 Pro (2017). Connected by turning on Bluetooth, starting the app, followed the prompts (open and closing the battery compartment when told), and it all connected. What would be nice, now, would be to enable audio pass through so when playing audio (through music apps or audiobooks) or video (e.g. YouTube) that it came through on the hearing aid. I'm not sure why this is taking so long to achieve since audio passthrough on Bluetooth is something that has been a capability for a long time now. Plus, Android occupies are fair size of the market, and not everyone has iPhones (or can afford them). So, please, we are literally begging you, enable media support/audio pass through for hearing aids connected to android phones (note: no, getting a connect clip is not the answer, as this another device to carry that can quite easily be lost).",
            "21 October 2020. This issue has reappeared. Tried reinstall with no success. App appears to be broken in latest update on Galaxy S10. When I open the app I see a gray rectangle and nothing else. Sound control and listening environment settings in notification area still work. Pairing works too."

Oh and there are buttons that are by default switched on tried pressing all 3 and nothing happens except a Little side note pops up saying they are on.. as if the red light on the button being lit didn't already mean that . Idk wasn't what i was hoping 4 so uninstalling n continuing on with my search",

I have 30 days to decide on a full refund of my $6,800.00. If these issues are not resolved within that time period my money will be better spent on a different company's product.",
            "Works . . . Sometimes. Clunky. \"Pairing\" only produces a tone my left ear; I assume that this is enough since the volume setting works for both. But only when it works! Trying repeated small adjustments caused it to stop responding, and the app had to be restarted to continue. I'm not impressed by the tone control, but it can be used to cut the uncomfortable treble in some situations. I had no expectation of taking calls from the phone, since my hearing aids aren't Bluetooth equipped.",
            "Disappointed. I have worn hearing aids for 12 years. After spending over $35,000.00 over 12 years I thought these Hearing aids were going to be the best. Not so. I am continuously adjusting. The app helps somewhat but the it does not keep the adjustments. I have to continually readjust. My audiologist works well with me but I don't like going in all the time. Wish I had not bought them.",
            "I hate this app! I have to reconnect it every time it opens and that is really frustrating. It looses the settings and has to be reset every time. Please Signia, fix this app and make it functional. I would also like to see independent volume controls for left and right.",
            "Not that great, the sound volume always get back to 8 if you shot down or change, doesn't hold the volume ## on the same level , hope get better improvement.The earing aids in my personal opinion should be the best one, for this price almost $8000, but is NOT, I don't believe exist earing aids that good to help to improve hearing.My android doesn't work well with this earing aids 😒, they said works better with iPhone, really???

The HA-802 with this app is far superior to the $4,000.00 hearing aids. Setup and operation is easy, straightforward and gives all of the necessary adjustments needed to customize for individual preferences.",

Almost every time, if over several hours, when I want to change the mode or the volume in a mode the app has to recouple to the hearing amplifiers in both ears instead of running in the background and being ready for a change.

            "Mimi has right approach to taking the measurements. However, the app gives poor strange summary on your hearing. I am almost one side deaf without hearing aids and have a moderate-severe high frequency hearing loss on both ears. The app said that I have average hearing with some difficulties in hearing in background noise and in hesring of high sounds. But I have real significant problems with that stuff. Not avarage. I should not buy the Beyerdynamic Lagoon with Mimi on board. It is gimmick.",
            "Dangerous app. The app showed the wrong volume on the bar letting me think the phones volume was on a low setting. Upon playing the background noise for the test the noise came out at full volume of 107 db with 4000 hz painful frequency and hurt my ears and pulled out headphones within 4 seconds. This app has ruined my life, I am having what may seem like chronic tinnitus over this exposure well over 2 months. This background noise seems a bit harmful and piercing in its frequency.",
            "Mimi has right approach to taking the measurements. However, the app gives poor strange summary on your hearing.",
            "this app has very respectful design, but its results seem pretty bogus. I have diagnosed hearing damage and scored fine to good in every range. All three of these stars are for not forcing me to make an account.",
            "the set up of the app is great but no matter how far away my results are from the \"normal\" range for that test my results always say I have \"very good tuning\" in that area??"

            "It works when it's connected to the hearing aids, BUT the app stops working for no apparent reason. I have to restart my phone throughout the day, then it works again. It's not bluetooth as that is always on. Not sure if it's a glitch in the app or not, but beware of that flaw, the settings you have set revert to something else and the hearing aids don't seem to work the way they should. This app is actually WORTHLESS!!",
            "It's better than nothing, but not by much. If you have only one Bluetooth device ( other than your hearing aids), you can leave it connected all the time, and the app works ok. But if you live in a multi-bluetooth world, switching between the devices is a huge pain in the petunia. Sometime the only solution is to power off the phone and all the devices, then start pairing with the device you want to use. In particular I want to use an Android phone and Streamline TV... but that's 2 devices.",
            "What the hell happened? When I first installed the app back in March everything worked, it was awsome. Now nothing, I can't change the hearing situations (theater, cafe, outdoors), everything is grayed out and can't be used. I've email the app developers and no response. I deleted it, reinstalled it, still the same. The app is basically now useless and no one is helping.",
            "The options reallyreally work! I was skeptical at first....but when I played with the options I was impressed with the improvement...especially with the tv and group conversations... thanks much...my friends saw the difference right away! I struggle much less to hear ....and am more connected to what's being discussed!",
            "Very useful being able to control my hearing aids from my phone. Would like it if hearing volume could be controlled by incrementally clicks, rather than by sliding. Everything else is great. Latest version doesn't have the audible battery test. I miss hearing the three beeps each morning as a hearing aid test."

            "Brilliant application, it's great for learning about ear anatomy. Unfortunately I rare it a 4 star due to its lack of information(in other terms, it doesn't have everything you need to know about ear anatomy. For instance, the ear drum is often referred to as the timmpanic membrane). In conclusion. The app isn't truly bad, however I would rather recommend \"Human Anatomy Atlas 2018/2019\"",
            "I didn't stay for long since I'm 13 but I've always had hearing problems and I've had operations and I've got one coming up in January, this has helped me understand the hearing mechanism a bit better, team, can you add animations that shows whatever surgeries that can be performed on the ear, I think it would be nice to know what goes on during my surgery but also see other surgeries that have happened on others also with hearing problems",

            "My hearing aid is pairing but only the system sounds can be played through my hearing aid while sounds from music and media come through my phone's speaker. Update: Unfortunately, just learned that my hearing aid (ENZO 3D) is compatible with iPhone only. However, I will be eligible for an upgrade in 2021 and by then, I'll be able to get a new pair of ReSound ENZO Q.",
            "When it works it is great but the Bluetooth connection is totally unreliable. Sometimes only the streaming function works and the hearing aids will not connect to your phone or only one of the two connects. I reloaded the app but after a few days of perfect operation the streaming function went away but the hearing aids connect each time.",
            "Resound ONE works great as I only have hearing loss in my left ear. However pairing with Android the Bluetooth settings do not give you an option to turn off the call and audio streaming like other bluetooth devices. I have to manually turn off bluetooth on every call and have to turn off bluetooth all together for watching anything even short videos to get sound out of the phone and not my single Resound ONE device. Please help!",
            "Finally have a phone (Google Pixel 4A) and Android version (11) allowing full use of this app with my Resound Preza (Costco) hearing aids. Phone ringing and call audio, video/music players, notification sounds..they all come to my HAs. Audio from Resound TV-2 streamer devices has lower priority, so that the audio stream fades if another sound source becomes active (e.g. notification chirp) and then resumes when the higher priority sound completes. And I don't have to use a phone clip.",
            "Enjoy the app and sound from TV Streamer 2 with my GN hearing aids. Recently however, my S9+ phone calls and media player only send audio to the right aid. About a month ago both aids worked with the phone. I get much better comprehension (25%) and enjoyment with both aids receiving sound. My wish is to have this android glitch corrected. Thank you for this nice product. Update: simple instructions from tech support fixed my android problems, many thanks Resound Tech Support Rocks!"

            "Even though I haven't tried the app yet, with the headset on, even through my phone speaker it is obvious to me this is a well-thought-out and professionally-made app to test your hearing. It's become harder & harder over time for me to understand other people speaking. Wondering whether those frequencies are getting harder me to be able to hear. Even with my phone speaker; I found out that it's true. (I looked up the frequencies of average human speech on a medical website)",
            "First off, this is the best free hearing test app available. No doubt about that, and a comparison to my actual hearing test from my audiologist shows a startling accuracy that I was not expecting. This app does however have a couple of areas where improvements can be made, including server connectivity problems and occasional loud hissing/static if the Hz are out of your device's threshold. But seriously, if used correctly, this app is incredibly accurate, especially for no money! Recommended.",
            "Great APP, I like it so far, Default calibration for original headset works accurate. Results give you a good idea of hearing status according to user age. I get recurrent hearing test, that's why I would recommend the developer to add an \"ear selection\" button; a \"Sound\" ON OFF button; Frequency selector button & volume control. This will give the APP the ability to test randomly each ear and to test someone else by instruct the person under test to indicate which ear hear a sound.",
            "The biological calibration process is fairly tedious, but wow it works. Using this app to self test, I received results very similar to those in a professional test booth. The fact that you can then choose recent calibration coefficients to apply to new tests means you only need to sit through the calibration process if you change headphones. This app is an excellent product.",
            "I give this app 5 stars for a very good experience. I've tested my young family, showing very plausible results. As an audio setup I've used a Bluetooth receiver with aptX HD, and the headset Cross from Roccat. Please don't use the phones analog audio output, since it can have very poor quality (signal to noise ratio for liw volume tones)."

            "Tried at least 8 different hearing aid apps here in google play but this one stands out as the best in sound amplification. Though I like the UI of others with equalizers but they're too weak. Another good one stops when the screen locks. So, I've finally chosen this app. It only lacks equalizer and a volume control while in use. I wish the developer would come out with an update with incorporated equalizer and volume control as the volume control of this version can only be adjusted before using.",
            "Obviously those who require hearing assistance will have a range of hearing impairment and I think it's unreasonable that there should be those who complain about these apps not doing enough. Personally, using a Samsung Galaxy 7 series phone, I have found this app to be tremendously beneficial and I am sincerely impressed with it and to the extent that I'm taking the time to write this review. I wish to thank the app developer for having done such a fine job, thank you.",
            "I would give this app 4.5 stars, if it had the feature of TURNING the F*** OFF when headphones are disconnected. (Warning, will very loudly feedback) And 5 stars if somewhere is explained what gold silver copper & iron are. ---@ all those who complain about delay. That's not their fault, programs only run as well, as is good the hardware running it. For me, the delay is about 1-2 seconds. - - Other than that, this app is the best I've found for listening to your surroundings. No other ones (of which I encountered) have the ability to control the decible amplification as clearly as this one. - - Give 6 stars, and my soul, if you could use the next & previous song buttons to control the amplification during listening, and play/pause button to turn on and off.",

            "It wont pair, asks for bluetooth even though silk 3NX is not bluetooth (but is designed to be used with this app.) I got these for the remote support option as it's a 5hr round trip to my hearing professional and now they wont pair I'm asked to mail them back or take a whole day driving to them at my own expense. These are not cheap hearing aides, I thought getting these was a step up. The old touch control app isn't designed for these but it works fine...but it isn't linked to the software that allows remote adjustment. Finding this the most frustrating and deflating experience. These are my first ever hearing aides and I'm left feeling sick, unsupported and basically ripped off.",

Liked my Starkey ones better . 3 months latter .they are terrible  hearing aids not at all user friendly .I am going  to give up on them. very frustrating. actually depresses me .my last pair (strkey ) blew these away",

            "This app really let's down the experience of otherwise excellent hearing aids. As mentioned by others, with the Bluetooth connection to your phone activated, any interaction with the phone(taking a call,'liking a post on Facebook,plugging in the charger etc etc), causes a default to Autosense option,which kills the settings on your aids,or the custom settings you may have defined for yourself.(This is even after switching off ALL notifications from phone) This is a major fault,and needs fixing.",
            "Slowish to connect but a useful app once it has. Easy to use. Like others Ive found the app quite frequently disconnects which does limit it use. The disconnections are more frequent and are limiting the use of the app. I've installed the updated app and it makes no difference to the disconnections.",
            "Volume doesn't stays consistent when when using the app. Have the hearing aids turned down when a message comes in the volume changes to a painful level. Tried using some of the preset programs, can't edit or save. My Resound app worked much better.",
            "At least once a week, I have to uninstall/reinstall the app because one or the other of the HAs won't connect. It's an irritant because the app controls the sound and pitch. Since I have rechargeable HAs, the app is the ONLY way to control that aspect. I give the HAs a 5star but would rate the app a 3. When it works it's very, very good. But when it doesn't it's horrid.",
            "Close to useless. It keeps disconnecting the Bluetooth and resetting back to Automatic. More trouble than it is worth sadly. Moto Android 1"

            "It's one of the best apps for hearing test on Android, I've been using it for a few years now. The developer finally released an update (thanks! it fixed that persistent crash on app closing, appreciate it!) My only gripe is with the calibration UI. The continuous tone calibration is basically useless, since it's hard to set the correct volume by up/down buttons as it keeps moving; it should've been done as a normal hearing test with subsequent value adjustments. Adjusting a test to another audiogram is much better, but the UI for it is very well hidden, and I'm not sure it works as advertised. I tried calibrating another device based on the previous I used, and the results are still widely different on the two devices. I also didn't find a way to store multiple custom adjustments (e.g. for different headphones); that would also be very useful.",
            "Using it in Demo mode, should really be called Uncalibrated mode. Using the same high quality Koss earphones and setup. Allows me to keep a progression chart and do tests after different exposure to loud sounds events. Suits my needs well.",
            "Having been tested several times by professionals (for tinnitus), I think this is a pretty good tool to check for potential issues, and see a professional.",
            "Absolutely fantastic app. this is the same like a professional hearing test.",
            "worked perfectly but just the print out issue and logo issues"

            "After the first week I have experienced zerorl problems connecting to my hearing aides, setup was easy and straightforward. I understand keeping the settings fairly simple however it would be nice for those who choose to have more \"advanced\" settings where have more frequency control and such. Would like to hopefully see more bluetooth features in the future. All in all a very good app and love the hearing aides.",
            "Update 9/10/20 - App fails to find Right aid. Swap batteries between devices and both connect. Battery level indicator ALWAYS shows Pea Green [Yellow in the manual] on both devices. Replaced batteries. App never shows anything but Pea Green until app won't connect. App might show Green for a few seconds with new batteries if the app is started within a few seconds after the battery door is closed. Without both devices connected, app is useless as it will not move past the connection screen. App version claims 2.1.4 but is more like 0.0.214 Phone app is difficult to adjust levels. \"Sliders\" jump and give annoying \"Maximum Threshold Reached\" message. HI has the most effect. MID and LOW, much less. Adjustability is fair. It takes a bit of futzing with EQ, Noise Reduction and Direction to achieve results. Aids annoyingly reset to Min and Program 1 if batteries are disconnected. Level adjustment could say L1, L2, etc. rather than just beep for levels 2 plus. Programs state Program 1, Program 2. Updated after 3 go-rounds: App is usable to configure and set various program functions. Completed the test on both devices, created profile. When I open app, no profile and it wants me to start over from scratch. The inability to remember devices is a pain. Having to depower one hearing aid so it can find the other is a joke in today's connected world. Really terrible application flow. Adjusting profile after completion based on age and gender makes no sense.",
            "Good concepts but improvements needed 1. Connection issues.. getting worst 2. Volume adjusting down randomly. 3 program is loss. Then a number appears where program icon was. What does this number mean. 4. Emailed support. Said they needed more info. If I had more info I would have sent it. 5. When all the above happens the hearing aids are telling me something. I dont know what because I cant hear. Why not have option for notifications on phone. The maybe I can give suppor more info",
            "I use the app daily with my MDHearing Core hearing aids, both right and left ear aids, and it works great. I love being able to change the program to suit my current environment, i.e. in a restaurant. One minor glitch I have discovered is that if your profile is established for both right and left ear aids, when you are only wearing one aid or if the battery is dead in one of the aids, the app refuses to sync with the one hearing aid you are wearing.",
            "So far no problem with the app. Sometimes a little slow connecting to the hearing aids. Very happy with these hearing aids."

            "Edited 10/17/20: I originally gave this app 5 stars, and for years recommended it to all my friends. Bible.is has the best audio bibles in my opinion. But the app has been giving me major problems for the last year probably. I can barely use it anymore. The app is so slow to respond to input. Audio stops suddenly and then begins throwing up error messages causing me to have to exit the app. Everything input wise is delayed making it unusable right now. Love you guys though. Samsung S7",
            "I was really happy with the app until recently. The more recent versions take a lot longer to open because of the splash screen. Additionally, when I attempt to sign in, nothing happens and I just get taken back to the blank sign in screen. This makes the app essentially unusable, since I can't download the audio without being logged in.",
            "I love the new look. Does have some glitches it seems after an update, but I find uninstalling it and reinstalling it seems to fix it. I did open an account but it keeps signing me out so it's not worth constantly signing back in. but that's fine I've been using it for a long time without an account just thought I would try it for study purposes and to be able to download/ try the other benefits of it etc.",
            "Previously gave it 5 stars but it now has a complicated and slow to load. For a bible app, I would expect the bible to be the most obvious item on the interface but you have to search to find the bible. Keeps going back to a previous chapter",
            "Has been a great app for years. For the past 3 months I have been signed out and given the error sign almost everytime I open the app. I appreciate the work that has been put in, but I can no longer hear it based on the technical issues I've been having."

            "It keeps saying an app is needed to use this device. Its installed but that same message appears even after uninstalling, and reinstalling. So I have hearing aids that have massive static, and what sounds like loud wind overpowering everything and anything people are say. My hearing loss is severe, 20% hearing in my right and 36% in my left. This helped a bit for a little while. Then I saw they were disconnected. Now it say app needed to use device but I have the app. What a mess, and stress",
            "Android support for hearing aids is poor, I have Galaxy s20 ultra and an iPhone XS plus. On the iPhone the Evoke app works perfectly as well as Com-Dex if I use the streamer. On the Galaxy Evoke pairing is a pain, drops connection, Com-Dex never connects. Widex needs to fix yes, but Android is a poor platform for those with Accessibility needs, if you really want to enjoy them get an iPhone. Calls stream perfectly and you'll enjoy your aids.",
            "I didn't see a big value in the app until I lost one of my hearing aids. Twenty four hours later, after buying a metal detector and using it all over the house and yard where I'd been working I thought about the app and wondered if it could help me find the aid. Sure enough! Great feature.",
            "This APP was already very poor and now after Sep. Android update is garbage as it no longer works at all !! I really regret having chosen widex for my hearing aid.",
            "The hearing is good but I was not informed that they only play music if you have an Apple I Phone 8 or newer! I have an android Samsung S9+ I had just purchased. I feel like I was mislead and wish I had known more about hearing aids before my accident!!!! These should be able to play music with the phone I have because it has a 2g extra setting to cover those problems. But WIDEX in their infinite wisdom hasn't bothered to fix this discriminatory practice. Overall if I had to do it again, I'd go to a more honest dealer. Just be careful, because the app became unuseable immediately after I posted this!"

            "Absolutely amazing..I'm scoring avg 82+ overall. But, elderly people or people with hearing problem would struggle to get 50+ It's a scientific approach to test your hearing. Thank you #WHO from 🇮🇳",
            "A good idea with plenty of limits that could be explained better. When one reviewer asked if the app can measure one ear at a time, the developer said it \"presents out-of-phase digits and picks up unilateral and conductive losses along with bilateral sensorineural losses\". I doubt most people would understand what you are saying, no matter how well they can hear. Please speak plainly. To calibrate the volume, how about encouraging users to lower the volume until one (differentiated) digit is no longer audible? Otherwise I could use a volume ranging from 50% to 100% and get vastly different results. Lastly, the app refers erratically to trained people and to professionals but doesn't define them. I recommend putting something in the FAQs about audiologists, Otolaryngologists etc., and how to find or identify a qualified expert (and avoid charlatans).",
            "Good ?!!! I only can hear in one ear and I scored about 43 with more than a one testing . Does it mean the other ear is damaged ?! I wish there is an option for testing only one ear .",
            "Don't waste your time! This is surprisingly terrible all it does output pink noise and the tones don't work with any headset! You'd think that it should work for all headsets and not just select ones. BTW trying to guess tones by there pitch is not a hearing test. A hearing test is based on amplitude of a pitch not how well you can recognise its frequency.  In response to the reply. First things first the message about stereo headsets is ridiculous all headsets are stereo name me one headset that is not! I'm a sound engineer and programmer the issue is not the headsets, btw I have tried about 20 pairs lying around the studio here, it is the programming of the app. What the message should say is a stereo enabled device is required, not headsets!",
            "- I would give more stars if It could evaluate separately right and left ears. - And because there is an option to chose your language but even though the speach is in English. So it's not understandable what you have to chose your language for? - Also, as you have to remember three digit sequence, the concentration or memory problems eventually could affect the results. - And, finally, I found an App \"Check your hearing\" which has many interesting features. - Thanks."

        "description": "RV Hearing Aid works like a hearing aid and assists users to listen clearly to the environmental voices without losing the important details. It makes use of your smartphone microphone to pick up environmental sound, and then processes the audio data before sending to audio output devices such as wired earphone, headphone or Bluetooth headset.\r\n\r\nThe Noise Reduction feature efficiently removes most of the noisy nuances picked up by the microphone, leaving behind clear voices with S/N ratio that is up to 30dB higher. (Do note that some phone models may not perform well using this feature, as it requires higher CPU processing power.) Alternatively, users can choose to turn off the Noise Reduction feature while in a quieter environment, simply by choosing the “Low Noise” option.\r\n\r\nUsers whose hearing needs are frequency specific may use the graphic audio equalizer feature to meet their need. At times where the audio input signals are weak, users may use the microphone pre-amp to increase audio output.   \r\n\r\nRV Hearing Aid also comes with a recording feature that allow users to record their conversations. They can go to “Records” to play or delete their recordings.\r\n\r\nTo achieve better sound quality, users may choose higher sampling rate under Settings. In some phone models, voice delay improves (reduces) with higher sampling rate. Some phone models may not perform well with higher sampling rates, as it requires higher CPU processing power.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  \r\n1)\tTake care when increasing volume. High volumes may adversely affect the ears.\r\n2)\tRV Hearing Aid does not work on every device equally well. Certain models may not run “Med Noise” and “High Noise” features well.

The PCs in the training room have the most uncomfortable headphones imaginable and after the first half hour I was fed up. Then an idea formed - I had my cell and a pair of ear buds why can't I try and pipe it through? So I placed my phone on the table and hung the computer headphone over the mic then popped my earbubs in. Worked absolutely great.",

I need to be able to trust the app and know that when I need to change my hearing aid settings, that I can do so immediately and not end up missing half the conversation while I struggle to reinstall the app. It's 2020 for goodness sake. We really shouldn't be having this issue.",

            "One step away from useless Could be so much better. Disconnects often, others have that problem too. One improvement I would suggest is to have the app store and start up with the user's preferred settings for mode, volume and tone quality. I need to adjust these settings every morning when I put them on. Maybe the one for iPhone is where they are focused."

But, it loses one star for the timer function not working-I have missed my work alarm a few times because of this, luckily my partner has been there to wake me. And it loses another star as it shuts down when your phone goes to sleep, so I have to change my phone's settings each night to never switch off and keep it on charge. I will keep the app, but I am on the look out for another unless Beltone can sort it out."

        "comments": [
            "I have a bit to say on this app. I love the idea of being able to control and fine-tune my hearing aids, but the usage is far from an optimal experience. I have an older Android, Google Pixel, running Q which when I installed the app was the latest OS available. In general, the app seems to regularly have trouble connecting and staying connected to both hearing aids. Often, I'll open the app and it's connected to one but not the other (it's usually connected to the right, not the left). It doesn't search for the left and there's no way to force the search in the app. Sometimes it's a matter of closing and re-opening the app, sometimes it's a matter of force stop and restart before it connects again. Then there's the rare but not rare enough issue of the app \"forgetting\" my hearing aids all together. The app opens and tells me no hearing aids are connected. No amount of restarting makes them find my hearing aids and I need to pair them again. When I'm home this isn't a \"big deal\", but in general, I'm adjusting my hearing aids because of a change in my environment, and having to stop to deal with a screwy app means I'm paying attention to the wrong thing. I've created some favorites. I've experimented with using GPS - I have a job with a decent amount of ambient noise so I have a setting I use at work and set the GPS location to the office. I gave the app Location permission no matter whether I'm using the app or not. To date - about a month of use - it has NEVER automatically switched when I arrive at the office, and I've given it time. This isn't a third party app, and I wonder how much Widex cares - they don't update the app with any consistency. They should recognize that the users that use the app are tech savvy and want this level of control and want it to just work. I have fewer issues with my Fitbit, and that's syncing constantly. When the app works, it works fairly well, but that's less often than 50% of the time. I do wish there was more education in the app - I can switch to Pure or Universal, but a well written app would give me an indication of what these settings do. For example, \"Better for a crowded restaurant\" or \"Enhances Speech\". Anything would be better than switching blindly and trying to listen for the subtle nuanced differences. Come on, Widex, get it together. For what hearing Aids cost, the app should not be their Achilles Heel.",
            "Like many of the reviews have mentioned I am not having much success with retaining connectivity with the ear pieces. I have an android phone. The software looks impressive but I am not able to utilise the capabilities of the product because of connectivity issue. It is very dissapointing as these are top of the range aids. It is rather pointless having customised programs for different situations when it takes 10-15 minutes to get it functioning.",
            "Contrary to the negative reviews, I'm having zero issues. The in-app pairing was simple, the sound customization options are great (I'll be playing with that for a while!). Once the streaming feature update comes to Android, 5 stars!",
            "Won't connect to my Moto G4 phone which is Android 7.0. Sees my 330 Moment hearing aids but always fails to pair. Zen Tinnitus and Tonelink apps both pair and work. Pairs and works with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet which is on Android 8.1.0 and I can create additional profiles to use other than the default Universal and Music, however no matter which new profile I have it on, the hearing aids also default back to Universal when I recharge them so is this hearing aids firmware or Moment app?",
            "When connected, works good. The issue is it takes 5 minutes or longer of un-pairing, re-paring, launching the app, closing the app. Very inconsistent and this will affect my decision on keeping or returning the Widex Moment aid. I have an Andriod btw... Update: Stopping and starting bluetooth helps but overall, this app is very unreliable. An update for Android is needed."

And of course the OnePlus series decided to jump on board with the idiotic move to get rid of headphone jacks for NO GOOD REASON. 😂😂😂 As the phone has plenty of space to add it... But monkey see, monkey do. But since this is the fault of the phone manufacturer and not devs, I couldn't logically give you a low rating because of this",

            "This is a pretty decent app. Sounds are good. And overall clarity is better than other apps I have tried out",
            "I didn't realize my hearing was that far gonee until I had to ask d someone multiple times to repeat themselves. The efficacy of the app is dependent upon the quality of the phone and the ear buds you are using. I tried multiple ear buds before finding a set that worked very wella with my LG Aristo. That being said, if there is someone that is very softspoken because their ears are hypersensitive. The Mic nor the app recognizes they said anything. Very frustrsting as my step dad does this. I have",
            "Just didnt work I wanted to be able to record and then share or save and just had hard time equalizing background noise and echo sorry work on that I'll probably be back to but in 9n the pro version"

        "description": "Q+ is a hearing app that provides you with an enhanced hearing experience. Q+ is intuitive, affordable, easily available and provides multiple listening settings for different sound environments (quiet and noisy).\r\n \r\nWith sophisticated technology inside, Q+ harnesses the processing power of your phone, giving you:\r\n \r\n* Inbuilt hearing tests calibrated for precision per ANSI standards\r\n* Intelligently-adjusted sound per hearing test results\r\n* High-quality sound enhancement by using the same algorithms as hearing aids\r\n* Wide bandwidth -up to  8000 Hz- for improved comprehension and clarity of sound\r\n* Automatic adjustment of amplification to reduce feedback (whistling sound) \r\n* Versatile controls for customizing listening experiences\r\n* Environmental noise reduction\r\n \r\nQ+ can be used with a phone's headset for improved speech comprehension and enhanced perception of environmental sounds.\r\n \r\nINBUILT HEARING TEST: The starting point for using Q+ is an inbuilt hearing test that uses a simple progression of tones played at varying intensities/pitches to get a map of hearing ability. The test is designed to be simple, yet exact, and is calibrated for accuracy per ANSI standards for audiometry. It intelligently performs audiometry and monitors ambient noise to check if the location is too loud for a test. Users who have access to their audiogram can enter their known hearing thresholds as a starting point instead of taking the test.\r\n \r\nQuadio recommends taking the test in a quiet environment for accurate results.\r\n \r\nINTELLIGENT SOUND ENHANCEMENT: Based on the results of the test, Q+ uses proprietary audio algorithms to process sounds signals according to hearing requirements. The algorithms have been developed after significant research and provide a clear, comfortable and crisp listening experience.\r\n \r\nCUSTOMIZABLE SETTINGS:  Control your listening experience in different environments. Choose from three baseline sound quality types (bass/midrange/treble boost), switch noise reduction on/off, and fine-tune the sound type by controlling how different types of sounds are treated (soft, loud, speech and distant sounds).\r\n \r\nADAPTIVE FEEDBACK CANCELLATION: Q+ performs adaptive feedback cancellation to eliminate whistling/howling sounds that emanate because of the high amplification performed inside the app coupled with close proximity of the headset mic to the speakers. If needed, you can choose to use the phone mic instead of the one in the headset.\r\n \r\nCOMPATIBILITY: While the Q+ app is available for all smartphones operating on Android 5.0 and above, it is currently calibrated and works optimally for LG Nexus 5X when using the stock headset.\r\n \r\nQ+ works most effectively with an Android operating system with a latency of less than 50 milliseconds (ms). For some phones the delay is much more than 50 ms, which results in lip-sync issues and a feeling of slurring of speech for the user. Android powers hundreds of models of phones, each with its own unique hardware. The Q+ signal processing software runs on a phone's hardware and must be calibrated for each phone with its headset to ensure that the app output is optimal. \r\n\r\nCertified and tested releases will be announced on our website (www.quadio.in), Twitter (@QuadioHearing) and Facebook (www.facebook.com/quadio/) web pages. \r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Before using any hearing correction mechanism, responsible self healthcare mandates having your ears/hearing health assessed by a medical professional to rule out any treatable causes of hearing loss and identify rightly the requirement for a hearing correction mechanism.\r\n\r\nThough the Q+ hearing test is designed to be accurate, results may vary based on the depth of insertion of earphones into the ears and ambient noise. Test results should not be construed as a substitute for an audiological evaluation performed by an audiologist.\r\n \r\nQ+ limits the sound output levels based on hearing loss but care should be taken to ensure that the loudness of the output is comfortable.",

For hearing aids that cost $7,000 a pair, it's dispicable that the quality of programming is so poor, considering my $30 Bluetooth earpiece connects every single time without fail. Shameful. New update- I worked with the manufacturer tech support for 30 minutes and they tried a bunch of things but couldn't fix it, I don't even think they understand how it works or what is wrong.",
            "I am 100% deaf in my right ear so purchasing a controllable hearing aid for my left ear was critical for quality of life with family & friends. I LOVE this digital hearing aid used with the Attune app. It is so comfortable, allows me to change settings for different scenarios, and so much more. The charger is a plus- batteries aren't needed and it cleans the hearing aid overnight. There is a learning curve with the app, but once understood, so easy to use. What a wonderful creation!!!",
            "Can not get app to pair with my Samsung Note 9 for phone or music. Will only pair with the ReSound link for tv. When is this expected to be working?",
            "I have an AGXR Q-series hearing aid. This app does most everything I need it to do - adjust volume, focus on speech, tinnitus management, etc. But as others have said it is lousy at pairing with my Android Pixel 3. The only reliable way I can get the hearing aid to connect to the phone is to restart my Pixel and then turn the hearing aid on. It is sort of a pain to have to do this every morning. For a 3K+ device you would think AGX could employ Android developers that could do a more professional job. Update : Seems to pay to write a bad review. A day or so after I wrote how bad pairing between my phone and my hearing aid was everything changed. Now it seems the app and my hearing aid are always connected. So I have upgraded my score from 2 to 3.",

        "description": "7-day free trial for Hearing Aid for Oreo 8.1:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stereomatch.hearing.aid.oreo\r\n\r\nHearing Aid for Oreo uses audio capabilities of Android Oreo 8.1 to deliver lowest-latency, fastest-response Hearing Aid app on Google Play!\r\n\r\n- Use headset or device microphones\r\n- Listen on earphones or device earpiece/speakers\r\n\r\n- Uses Oreo low latency audio for a practically usable Hearing Aid app!\r\n- Runs in background, even with screen off!\r\n- Tested: 10 hour continuous use on single battery charge (Nexus 4 - Oreo 8.1)\r\n\r\n- Easy swiping between Volume, Equalizer and Settings screens\r\n- Use Volume screen for overall volume setting\r\n- Boost Hi-Band on Equalizer to compensate for age-related hearing loss\r\n- Use Settings screen to choose which microphone and speaker to use.\r\n\r\n- TalkBack friendly for blind users\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:  Not a medical device.  Get hearing tested, and use devices prescribed by professionals.  Try this app to explore how apps can improve speech comprehension.\r\n\r\nWhen you first use the app, be careful not to increase volume too high.  Volume can be adjusted using your Android volume buttons.  But if you don't want to change your Android volume levels, you should use the Volume screen to set overall volume depending on the environment you are in, and use the Equalizer screen to customize for each ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss usually affects the high frequency range of hearing.  Hearing aid devices can compensate for this by increasing the volume on the Hi-Band.  This can improve comprehension of fricative sounds like 't' and 'sh' ('show' and 'sow' or 'table' and 'cable' are often confused, if you have age-related hearing loss).\r\n\r\nHowever, hearing loss may not always be at the high-frequency end, and may affect younger people as well.  Which is why testing is important, to figure out which frequency bands require boosting to compensate for the specific hearing loss in each ear.  The Hearing Aid device is then programmed to boost the frequency bands which require compensation.\r\n\r\nThis app provides a simple 3-band Equalizer.  Since it only has 3 volume settings to adjust, it may be easier for users to judge which settings work better for them.  Usually for age-related hearing loss, you will improve comprehension by boosting the Hi-Band on the Equalizer.  Other users may prefer other settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarphones/headset, Lapel mic, or device microphone\r\n\r\nUse earphones or headset for best results.  In a pinch, you can use the Android device's built-in earpiece to listen, while using the same device's built-in microphone - however, this approach will lead to feedback at higher volumes (the device microphone will hear the output of the device's earpiece or speaker, which is a feedback loop, which creates an unpleasant whine sound).  If you use an external lapel microphone, then you can use the built-in earphones on device to listen.\r\n\r\nIt is best to use earphones to listen, while using the device microphones to record.  Or use a lapel microphone, or USB microphone for better quality.  Whichever configuration you choose, test for latency - some combinations give lower latency (better) than others.  Usually this will give the lowest latency: using a headset (with built-in mic) or plugging a Y-splitter into the android earphone jack, and plugging in separate earphone and separate microphone into the Y-splitter.\r\n\r\nBluetooth headsets can be used, but usually have much higher latencies (bluetooth latency is high on android), so may be more confusing to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLow latency / Fast response (Oreo Audio)\r\n\r\nThis app makes use of the audio improvements in Android Oreo.\r\n\r\nIf you like the low latency quality of the app, please support by purchasing the app.\r\n\r\nIf you paid for the app, but are not satisfied, please click Menu - Contact to e-mail us for a refund.

Volume can be adjusted using your Android volume buttons.  But if you don&#39;t want to change your Android volume levels, you should use the Volume screen to set overall volume depending on the environment you are in, and use the Equalizer screen to customize for each ear.<br><br><br>Age-related hearing loss<br><br>Age-related hearing loss usually affects the high frequency range of hearing.  Hearing aid devices can compensate for this by increasing the volume on the Hi-Band.  This can improve comprehension of fricative sounds like &#39;t&#39; and &#39;sh&#39; (&#39;show&#39; and &#39;sow&#39; or &#39;table&#39; and &#39;cable&#39; are often confused, if you have age-related hearing loss).<br><br>However, hearing loss may not always be at the high-frequency end, and may affect younger people as well.  Which is why testing is important, to figure out which frequency bands require boosting to compensate for the specific hearing loss in each ear.  The Hearing Aid device is then programmed to boost the frequency bands which require compensation.<br><br>This app provides a simple 3-band Equalizer.  Since it only has 3 volume settings to adjust, it may be easier for users to judge which settings work better for them.  Usually for age-related hearing loss, you will improve comprehension by boosting the Hi-Band on the Equalizer.  Other users may prefer other settings.<br><br><br>Earphones/headset, Lapel mic, or device microphone<br><br>Use earphones or headset for best results.  In a pinch, you can use the Android device&#39;s built-in earpiece to listen, while using the same device&#39;s built-in microphone - however, this approach will lead to feedback at higher volumes (the device microphone will hear the output of the device&#39;s earpiece or speaker, which is a feedback loop, which creates an unpleasant whine sound).  If you use an external lapel microphone, then you can use the built-in earphones on device to listen.<br><br>It is best to use earphones to listen, while using the device microphones to record.  Or use a lapel microphone, or USB microphone for better quality.  Whichever configuration you choose, test for latency - some combinations give lower latency (better) than others.  Usually this will give the lowest latency: using a headset (with built-in mic) or plugging a Y-splitter into the android earphone jack, and plugging in separate earphone and separate microphone into the Y-splitter.<br><br>Bluetooth headsets can be used, but usually have much higher latencies (bluetooth latency is high on android), so may be more confusing to use.<br><br><br>Low latency / Fast response (Oreo Audio)<br><br>This app makes use of the audio improvements in Android Oreo.<br><br>If you like the low latency quality of the app, please support by purchasing the app.<br><br>If you paid for the app, but are not satisfied, please click Menu - Contact to e-mail us for a refund.

            "Despite the hearing aids costing £3k, unless you have an iPhone it is a waste of time (certainly on my Android - Huawai - which is, a good phone) as it constantly drops out so doesn't work unless re-paired with the aids which is not always possible. It is about time manufactures did something about this as apparently (like Oticon) they are really designed for iPhone - they should realise there are millions of people out there who don't want or own an iPhone!",
            "This app since update has not connected as well as previous. I'm in COVID lock down and I noted it wasn't finding LH aid of a morning (RH was okay), checked battery etc. I was ready to get LH aid serviced. Then after I closing the app and restarting it, it found both aids and is okay. It is 7 am here and I just enabled both aids and it connected okay. Since update I have had to fiddle on a number of occasions and restart phone. Satisfactory connection is a cornerstone of this product - it MUST work, and work well!",
            "We constantly had issues with the app not finding the hearing aids. After two frustrating years we purchased a Samsung tab A and everything finally worked. Less than two months later a revised version of the app was pushed. Now we can't even use the new Tab A to connect. We contacted Bernifone by email and followed their instructions to the letter. No fix. So far all they have done is add a message to the download that the app may not work correctly with the device.",
            "When it works, this app is fine. But I cannot get it to connect to my Zerena 9 hearing aids for more than a day. Just this morning I uninstalled and then reinstalled it to get a connection to my hearing aids. I went to check the battery level just now and it will not connect to them. This happens all the time. I have to uninstall and reinstall it to get a connection. Is there any way for the developer to make this app more reliable? After all the money we pay for hearing aids, you'd think we could get reliable phone apps.",

Reasonably useful for controlling hearing aids, but sound environment tracking function is unreliable because the app ceases to function frequently, requiring a restart. You won't know this until you try to change the hearing aid settings. I've used this app on both Android and iPhone with similar results. Doesn't look like this app is updated regularly.",
            "Too often you have to reset it I. order for it to accurately change and click. I find the bass going down to nothing and I haven't touched it. The app keeps shutting down my bass no matter what even my phone sits on the table. Half the time it works but when it changes settings on it's own I only know when I can't hear right. Don't like it",

        "description": "Altersbedingter Hörverlust (Presbyakusis) ensteht durch alters- und lärmbedingte Veränderungen im Innenohr und in der Hörrinde des Gehirns. Bei vielen Menschen entsteht Presbyakusis schon im Alter von ca. 40-50 Jahren und nimmt über das Alter hinweg stetig zu. Bereits ungefähr 50% der über 80-Jährigen unserer Bevölkerung werden mit mindestens einer leichten Form von Presbyakusis diagnostiziert. Oft führt dies dazu, dass die Betroffenen Schwierigkeiten haben, einem Gespräch zu folgen und das Gegenüber zu verstehen. Besonders in Situationen mit vielen Nebengeräuschen wie zum Beispiel in einem Restaurant oder am Bahnhof oder wenn das Gegenüber undeutlich spricht, wird das Verstehen von Sprache umso anstrengender und teilweise fast unmöglich. Oft berichten betroffene Personen, dass sie durch die Anstrengung schnell ermüden und beispielsweise Mühe haben, die lauten Nebengeräusche auszublenden und sich nur auf das Gegenüber zu konzentrieren. \r\nDie Folgen von Hörverlust schwanken also stark je nach Situation, in der man sich befindet (z.B. im lauten Restaurant oder in einer sehr ruhigen Umgebung) und beeinträchtigen über den Tag hinweg mal stärker und mal schwächer. Weitere Gründe für Schwankungen können aber auch die Tageszeit, die aktuelle Tätigkeit, die aktuelle Stressempfindung und vieles mehr sein. Viele Menschen können eine gute Einschätzung dieser Schwankungen abgeben und den Zeitverlauf aus dem Gedächtnis rekonstruieren - eine exakte Messung dieser Schwankungen ist damit aber nicht gegeben. Eine systematische Erfassung des Hörverlusts und ihrer Schwankungen im Einfluss auf das Sprachverstehen über mehrere Wochen war bislang noch nicht möglich.\r\nMit diesem Forschungsprojekt wollen wir eine Möglichkeit bieten, die individuellen Schwankungen des Hörvermögens mittels einer Smartphone-App zu erfassen. Mit Hilfe Ihres Smartphones können Sie die Schwankungen Ihres Hörvermögens und deren Folgen systematisch messen und herausfinden, wie diese mit Ihrem Tagesablauf und Ihren Aktivitäten zusammenhängen. Über die Internetseite können Sie den Verlauf Ihrer eigenen Daten einsehen und gegebenenfalls mit Ihrem behandelnden Arzt oder Therapeuten besprechen.\r\nMit Ihrer Teilnahme unterstützen Sie unser Forschungsprojekt, die Schwankungen des Hörvermögens, dessen Ursachen und Wirkung besser zu verstehen.\r\n\r\n\r\nÜber das Team\r\n\r\nTrackYourHearing wurde von der Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI), dem Institut für Datenbanken und Informationssysteme (DBIS) der Universität Ulm und der Forschungsgruppe Neuroplastizitäts- und Lernforschung des gesunden Alterns (HAB LAB) der Universität Zürich entwickelt.

Oft berichten betroffene Personen, dass sie durch die Anstrengung schnell ermüden und beispielsweise Mühe haben, die lauten Nebengeräusche auszublenden und sich nur auf das Gegenüber zu konzentrieren. <br>Die Folgen von Hörverlust schwanken also stark je nach Situation, in der man sich befindet (z.B. im lauten Restaurant oder in einer sehr ruhigen Umgebung) und beeinträchtigen über den Tag hinweg mal stärker und mal schwächer. Weitere Gründe für Schwankungen können aber auch die Tageszeit, die aktuelle Tätigkeit, die aktuelle Stressempfindung und vieles mehr sein. Viele Menschen können eine gute Einschätzung dieser Schwankungen abgeben und den Zeitverlauf aus dem Gedächtnis rekonstruieren - eine exakte Messung dieser Schwankungen ist damit aber nicht gegeben. Eine systematische Erfassung des Hörverlusts und ihrer Schwankungen im Einfluss auf das Sprachverstehen über mehrere Wochen war bislang noch nicht möglich.<br>Mit diesem Forschungsprojekt wollen wir eine Möglichkeit bieten, die individuellen Schwankungen des Hörvermögens mittels einer Smartphone-App zu erfassen. Mit Hilfe Ihres Smartphones können Sie die Schwankungen Ihres Hörvermögens und deren Folgen systematisch messen und herausfinden, wie diese mit Ihrem Tagesablauf und Ihren Aktivitäten zusammenhängen. Über die Internetseite können Sie den Verlauf Ihrer eigenen Daten einsehen und gegebenenfalls mit Ihrem behandelnden Arzt oder Therapeuten besprechen.<br>Mit Ihrer Teilnahme unterstützen Sie unser Forschungsprojekt, die Schwankungen des Hörvermögens, dessen Ursachen und Wirkung besser zu verstehen.<br><br><br>Über das Team<br><br>TrackYourHearing wurde von der Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI), dem Institut für Datenbanken und Informationssysteme (DBIS) der Universität Ulm und der Forschungsgruppe Neuroplastizitäts- und Lernforschung des gesunden Alterns (HAB LAB) der Universität Zürich entwickelt.

            "The app worked fine on my LG G6 for about a month then it would not connect to my hearing aids.  I tried deleting and reinstalling the app but still no luck.  Also, why does the app need location services enabled?  All it needs to do is connect to my hearing aids so what does my location have to do with that?  UPDATE:  The app was not working due to location services being disabled.  Now it works with new batteries but once they are a few days old it won't connect.",
            "App works on my Nexus 7 tablet but sometimes aids won't connect. Can't use app on Samsung Luna phone cuz there are no connect buttons visible on screen. Today I discovered that double tapping left side of screen connected my left aid, and on right side it connected right aid. Eureka!Both devices run Android 6.0.1. Once connected, controls work. I wish it would remember whether I'm adjusting both aids or one until I change it.",
            "I like the hearing aids and they work well . But i think they should develop a better app with more user control. I would like to contol tones and other options. In other words I would like full control over my hearing aids instead of driving 100 miles to have them adjusted.",
            "At first I was unable to get the right hearing aid to connect and was told there was a known android problem. So I uninstalled and reinstalled and now they both connect for some unknown reason."

Phillip's reply that I should check their compatability list is no help. My ipad pro is listed as compatible, but detects and connects to one hearing aid, the same issue as my other devices. The older aids connected. The new one does not.",
            "Doesn't work on Samsung. Not happy. Should have no star. It even warns you before you install that it's a low reputation app. Update: do not buy Philips. Zero stars. Update still sucks. I was in contact with Philips for 2 months... they finally gave up. Lmao Do not buy Philips. I've been robbed. Update: still sucks. Update... DO NOT BUY!!!",
            "Connecting is hit or miss on andriod. I just got a replacement hearing aid. Now it won't link at all. Downloaded latest version of this program. No better.",

            "This app is great for adjusting the volume, BUT it does not have a way to quit the app, keeping it running constantly on the Android. In fact, when my hearing aids are removed, batteries out, it still reports the hearing aid. When it is wrong (says an aid is disconnected), you have to restart your phone because the app doesn't refresh. Needs improvement. Doesn't appear to have a way to email the developers."

            "I was able to connect both of my ears but after loading this new version of Remote Link I can not get to my ears. It just goes into a cycle trying to connect with no success. Is it possible to go back to the previous level of this product. It was working fine for me? I am currently having problems again. One hearing aid connects and the the product indicates that it is waiting on the other aid. This is very annoying. The original program worked fine until it was updated. 5/29/20.",
            "I am using the android. This app does not sync consistently. When it finally does sync with the hearing aids, the connection is sporatic at best. I have had my hearing aids for 3 weeks and have been told Remotelink is the only app that is authorized with these hearing aids. It is a waste of time to use this app. It is a shame that I cannot access the full function of the hearing aids through the app. There are times when I want to increase the volume and times I want to decrease it. Not everyone can do the iphone.",
            "For no reason, the hearing aids get \"disconnected\". Attempts to reconnect fail, despite turning aids on/off (several times). Also, \"find my hearing aids\" option is complete nonsense: It indicates that aids are about 1 mile away when they are on my person! The app worked for a while, right after downloading, but has failed for the last 3 days. Good thing this app is free. You get what you pay for.",
            "Works Well. I have the Costco Burnafon aids and my phone is a Moto E5 Play with Android 8.0. The app connected to my aids without issue. I woukd like the ability to turn the app completey off to save my phone battery. So I force it to stop via the app manager. When it starts up it finds and connects to my aids right away. I wouldnt call this a feature rich app, but it does control volume in each aid or both and switch programs. The locate function is silly.",
            "This app is awful, it sucks for my Android phone. I'm constantly having to restart it after reconnecting my hearing aids 1 or 2 days, 3 days if I'm lucky, then if that doesn't work I have to completely restart my phone. Are you ever going to develop a way for this app to work with Android phones?? Not everyone has an iPhone!! It pisses me off that I have to, restart the app because it isn't compatible with Android phones every single day!! If I could find another app that would work I'd use it."

            "Well, it SORT OF works, I guess. I really wouldn't know, because I HAVE NO CLUE as to how some of the controls work. I mean, sure I understand \"Left/Right Ear Volumes,\" and, of course \"Phone Volume.\" I am glad to have known about 1 more control, which was \"dB Gain.\" It is really just about the same as the other volumes except that it has a real unit of measurement, the Decibel (dB). A whisper is about 30, while 50-60 is a normal, relaxed conversation. A jackhammer or a power saw is about 100-110, and Rock concerts, jet engines, and shotgun blasts can all be between 120-145. And, believe it or not, the loudest sound any human is likely to hear (and live to talk about it) is a Humpback Whale at a (very likely) permanently damaging 168 decibels! And if you are unlucky enough to hear that under the water where sound actually travels 5 times faster than it does through the air, you may well never hear anything again. And if do end up hearing anything but a loud hiss for the rest of your life, it would qualify for being a miracle.   WOW, did I go off-subject. Sorry. Things like that are just so awesome to me. So, yeah I would like to know what those other controls do, exactly, and what they mean, or are for. It is easy to forget that if you are in some line of work where you pretty much have your own language, it is important to remember that not everyone can understand what all this stuff means.",

Now Friday and very happy to say problem fixed thanks, happy again now 😁",

The last adjustment on the right for clarity does absolutely nothing. These aides are a complete waste of your money. And there seems to be very little concern by anyone to help improve the issues. Calling Widex help line is a complete waste of time and effort.",
            "If only the telephone input to the hearing aid was available to Android phones it would be 5 stars.",
            "Widex is deceiving Android users into thinking streaming will work with devices listed. I have Galaxy S7 and I was told a year ago, that they are working on it to stream Nothing yet, they are ignoring the Android users Almost 3 years now and no Android streaming, for a European company you're ignoring a large sector of the market",
            "I set my \"favorite\" setting as both ears, the low, middle, and high all the all the way up because, by default, these things barely help. If I accidentally hit a button on them or get done listening to something through them, they refer back to their worthless \"normal\" setting. No! Go back to how I see it! I shouldn't have to open this stupid app! Also, it really pisses me off that I have to buy a comdex because this medical device has exclusivity with Apple! Widex, how greedy. Shame on you!",
            "These hearing aids get the job done but the Bluetooth compatibility is extremely frustrating. I cannot take my hearing aids on and off all day to use my Bluetooth piece. My rep (San Francisco Hearing and Speech Center) told me android would become available. Its been over a year and nothing. The app is useful if you want to adjust audio settings. I uninstalled it because I never use it. Please work to get Android users Bluetooth compatibility. I believe $6,000+ is a high price to pay!"

        "description": "Test using 'Hearing Aid for Oreo 8.1 Free' before purchase:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stereomatch.hearing.aid.oreo.demo\r\n\r\nHearing Aid for Oreo uses audio capabilities of Android Oreo 8.1 to deliver lowest-latency, fastest-response Hearing Aid app on Google Play!\r\n\r\n- Use headset or device microphones\r\n- Listen on earphones or device earpiece/speakers\r\n\r\n- Uses Oreo low latency audio for a practically usable Hearing Aid app!\r\n- Runs in background, even with screen off!\r\n- Tested: 10 hour continuous use on single battery charge (Nexus 4 - Oreo 8.1)\r\n\r\n- Easy swiping between Volume, Equalizer and Settings screens\r\n- Use Volume screen for overall volume setting\r\n- Boost Hi-Band on Equalizer to compensate for age-related hearing loss\r\n- Use Settings screen to choose which microphone and speaker to use.\r\n\r\n- TalkBack friendly for blind users\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:  Not a medical device.  Get hearing tested, and use devices prescribed by professionals.  Try this app to explore how apps can improve speech comprehension.\r\n\r\nWhen you first use the app, be careful not to increase volume too high.  Volume can be adjusted using your Android volume buttons.  But if you don't want to change your Android volume levels, you should use the Volume screen to set overall volume depending on the environment you are in, and use the Equalizer screen to customize for each ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss usually affects the high frequency range of hearing.  Hearing aid devices can compensate for this by increasing the volume on the Hi-Band.  This can improve comprehension of fricative sounds like 't' and 'sh' ('show' and 'sow' or 'table' and 'cable' are often confused, if you have age-related hearing loss).\r\n\r\nHowever, hearing loss may not always be at the high-frequency end, and may affect younger people as well.  Which is why testing is important, to figure out which frequency bands require boosting to compensate for the specific hearing loss in each ear.  The Hearing Aid device is then programmed to boost the frequency bands which require compensation.\r\n\r\nThis app provides a simple 3-band Equalizer.  Since it only has 3 volume settings to adjust, it may be easier for users to judge which settings work better for them.  Usually for age-related hearing loss, you will improve comprehension by boosting the Hi-Band on the Equalizer.  Other users may prefer other settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarphones/headset, Lapel mic, or device microphone\r\n\r\nUse earphones or headset for best results.  In a pinch, you can use the Android device's built-in earpiece to listen, while using the same device's built-in microphone - however, this approach will lead to feedback at higher volumes (the device microphone will hear the output of the device's earpiece or speaker, which is a feedback loop, which creates an unpleasant whine sound).  If you use an external lapel microphone, then you can use the built-in earphones on device to listen.\r\n\r\nIt is best to use earphones to listen, while using the device microphones to record.  Or use a lapel microphone, or USB microphone for better quality.  Whichever configuration you choose, test for latency - some combinations give lower latency (better) than others.  Usually this will give the lowest latency: using a headset (with built-in mic) or plugging a Y-splitter into the android earphone jack, and plugging in separate earphone and separate microphone into the Y-splitter.\r\n\r\nBluetooth headsets can be used, but usually have much higher latencies (bluetooth latency is high on android), so may be more confusing to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLow latency / Fast response (Oreo Audio)\r\n\r\nThis app makes use of the audio improvements in Android Oreo.\r\n\r\nIf you like the low latency quality of the app, please support by purchasing the app.\r\n\r\nIf you paid for the app, but are not satisfied, please click Menu - Contact to e-mail us for a refund.

Other users may prefer other settings.<br><br><br>Earphones/headset, Lapel mic, or device microphone<br><br>Use earphones or headset for best results.  In a pinch, you can use the Android device&#39;s built-in earpiece to listen, while using the same device&#39;s built-in microphone - however, this approach will lead to feedback at higher volumes (the device microphone will hear the output of the device&#39;s earpiece or speaker, which is a feedback loop, which creates an unpleasant whine sound).  If you use an external lapel microphone, then you can use the built-in earphones on device to listen.<br><br>It is best to use earphones to listen, while using the device microphones to record.  Or use a lapel microphone, or USB microphone for better quality.  Whichever configuration you choose, test for latency - some combinations give lower latency (better) than others.  Usually this will give the lowest latency: using a headset (with built-in mic) or plugging a Y-splitter into the android earphone jack, and plugging in separate earphone and separate microphone into the Y-splitter.<br><br>Bluetooth headsets can be used, but usually have much higher latencies (bluetooth latency is high on android), so may be more confusing to use.<br><br><br>Low latency / Fast response (Oreo Audio)<br><br>This app makes use of the audio improvements in Android Oreo.<br><br>If you like the low latency quality of the app, please support by purchasing the app.<br><br>If you paid for the app, but are not satisfied, please click Menu - Contact to e-mail us for a refund.

Can't watch TV, can't use the phone, literally ruining my life because some clever guy thought it a good idea to lock the app into a cloud account. Even when it works it regularly logs me out and when we go abroad with no internet it's useless and for the sole reason that they wanted to lock me into their \"cloud\". Rediculous. Makes me so mad!",
            "The app has been down since Tuesday and I've been told you're 'working on it' but this is now a significant amount of time. I can't stream and have since struggled with phone calls unable to do so. My remote has never been used so isn't an option and unlikely to be up to date for use. This has made the last few days quite difficult with no known duration of the app being unavailable.",
            "Not operational, maybe you should be HoH (Hard of Hearing) to test this before making it official, it's was good till the moment it's permanently disconnected, tried force stopping, reinstalling none work, but when I reinstalled and attempt to relogin, it tells me that it has maintance? Wish I know that before I uninstalled it... Not happy how not operational you guy work on this, do better.",

I got Android samsung A50 won't connect audio streaming while my girlfriend got samsung A70 and work great on it. What is the difference between these 2 phone. Would give a 5 star if have audio streaming working."

            "Edit: syfy still not working Garbage app ive scanned 10 different channels that are supported and each time it tunes me in to some random channel it selects that is nowhere close to what I'm watching. I tried syfy channel it gave me baseball on some random espn2 feed. Why can't I just select the channel I'm on and you tune in to it? If you support all those channels I should be able to select my channel that I'm on. Don't waste your time with this app its all over the place",
            "Used to like it. It's a great idea. Sad that you get to watch ads on TV and then this app ads more ads every 10 seconds. I considered premium until I realized it's a monthly thing. There are bluetooth options at Walmart that do this exactly what this app does for $14.99. Buy it once and use it until it breaks or you lose it. Ditch the ads. 2.99 a month? I don't think I'll use it that much. Thanks but I'll move on.",
            "Have not used in a while. Thought I would try it again. I understand the need to try and get people to subscribe. But the trial version is so aggravating with the stoppages trying you make you sign up, it is useless to even try. Seems to work, but if you are going to do a 7 day trial, do a trial. Don't stop it every 10 minutes and make me go through steps to get it working again . Permanently deleting now. Correction, now it seems to be every 2 minutes.",
            "TOO. MANY. ADS! Seriously, if you can't offer ad-based service without a 30-second video interruption - including missing the show - several times an hour, don't bother. And in dozens of uses, I don't think I've ever had error-free audio and am constantly out-of-sync. If there was another option, I'd use it.",
            "Too many ads, and too many bugs. The app can't even connect to the server which is embarrassing for the developers. This app used to be great, but now it's turned into a sham and cash grab for the company, and a waste of storage space on our phones. Deleting the app very soon unless you can show me that this app will function as intended."

            "This app is totally useless! So far not impressed. Same complaint as many others. App does not keep settings while changing screens on your phone. My phones Bluetooth stays connected but app does not keep settings. Bringing these back ASAP! It's a shame because I like the hearing aids but your software is useless. Apparently they blame the phones instead of their own inability to be compatible. Why stay in business then? Fix the app or go away!",
            "I've used this app for over a year, when it connects and works it's great. However that's when it connects. There is no rhyme or reason to when or why it connects / disconnects. Every morning the equipment connects fine via bluetooth, however when I launch the comdex app, things disconnect and if I'm lucky incan get it to reconnect. Most days it doesn't like today.... I reboot my phone reboot all devices and still won't connect. But it might tomorrow. It's such an asset when it works"

The noise cancelling seems to work, I am not very sure, while in earphone, I can still hear the noisy traffic, just a bit reduced. Also does not have option to use SD card as music source. Also not sure what normalizer exactly does, it seems to just increase the volume",
            "Best app in my life for regulating earphones. As told denoiser wasn't working in closed environment it mute the audio playing on the device have to try on other regions. One minor drawback in wireless earphones is when disconnected, the audio resumes playing compared to other music players.",
            "I can't play from Soundcloud. Every time i click \"Soundcloud\", the app crashes and i have to re-enter the app. Still doesnt work even after a few tries",
            "Its really cool but if u could record it would be much better please let us be able to record while singing to the song",
            "In my opinion mobile phones aren't very fast at processing sound from the microphone.Active noise cancellation is basically the mic sound but the phase is inverted. When these inverted waveforms are played over the environment noises they cancel each other out (0dB). This requires extremely low latency. A few microseconds of latency will cause an unsuccessful noise cancellation. That's why active noise cancellation can't be executed digitally. Op-amps can be used since they are analogue devices."

            "This is my updated review 7/31/2020. I have increased a star. The app is user friendly and easy to use. It is so nice to be able to use my aids as buds. I like the drop down menu to change volume/mode of hearing instead of having to go into the app itself when watching YouTube etc. It does not randomly disconnect as much anymore. I rarely use this app for calls. Battery life is not great 2 to 3 days but that changed after custom molds I was getting 4 to 5 days.",
            "I'm new to hearing aids as of Friday 1/3/2020 and this app. This app was suggested by my audiologist. My list of cons are below for this app. 1. Burns my Motorola Z Force 3 battery down and fast. 2. Really, really wish that I could stream music and link phone calls and texts through my hearing aids which is a big plus with me. 3. Whatever Apple users can do on their cell phones, tablets and iPods, Android users should be able to do the same.",
            "Sure would be nice to be able to answer phone calls through the app. Even just to hear the phone ring would be really nice without having to send more money on a device to connect the two together. When using to control the volume I have to remember if I want to adjust the right side to use the left side of the the phone. The left is the right and the right is the left.",
            "Newest update has screwed everything up. Woke up the other day to find out there's a new update. Now my hearing aids spontaneously disconnect, won't reconnect, won't respond to volume control, and takes forever connect hearing aids when batteries aee changed. Why can't we do everything that Apple users can do. I want to stream music and answer phone calls through my hearing aids.",
            "I would like to see additional functionality for android phones, linking cell phone for calls and streaming media. Similar to what is in the apple app. The functions I have now are pretty much limited to adjusting volume and battery level. UPDATE After using the app for a while, it needs a major overhaul. It randomly disconnects from one or both hearing aids, can't connect at all and I have to restart both aids and the app more than once to get the connection back."

We offer simple to use interface that needs very little explanations. It is self explanatory. And it is elegant.\r\n\r\nWhy Neutralizer?\r\n\r\nIf you would like to improve your listening experience on a mobile device, you would mostly come into conclusion that you need a better hardware. Although in most situations it might be true you don’t always know why. \r\nThis is because of so many parameters you have to take into account like: the digital to analog conversion, the signal frequency range, the amplification path, the speakers (or headphones) frequency response, the psychoacoustics and so on. You can measure each of the parameters, but to measure them all you only have one device—your ears.\r\n\r\nOne way to improve your hearing ability is to use sound enhancers like equalizers. Most of them distort sound quality but if you use it wisely, you can minimize the deficiencies of your acoustic tract. The key word here is “wisely”. \r\nIn order to do it wisely you have to make some tests to discover the problem. \r\nAnd that’s what Neutralizer does. It tests your hearing ability in key frequency ranges and adapts the system equalizer to take it into account. As simple as that.\r\n\r\nCurrent limitations: the sad fact is that Neutralizer will not work for everybody. There are mobile devices not compatible with our solution that don’t allow third party apps to control system equalizer. We are working towards a solution to satisfy everybody, but for the time being your mileage may vary. It is, what it is. Please don’t give us bad rating because of this. We told you so.",

            "*** THIS IS A 6⭐APP***Does exactly what it says it will. And honestly it not only does it's job well, but it does a better job than some audio enhancement apps that I have paid $10 a month subscription fees for, just to be sorely disappointed down the road. Uses a clever approach to frequency isolation and adjustment, to give each user a near perfect listening experience. No better app of its type out there. DEFINITELY AM EXAMPLE TO BE FOLLOWED BY OTHER DEVELOPERS IN IT'S CLASS!!! GOOD JOB",
            "I very very rarely leave reviews, but after using this, I definitely had to give this 5 stars. I'm really big into sound, and to be able to tune sound to my ears is a really awesome thing to be able to do. The app is alittle confusing at first, but to keep it short and sweet, you raise and lower the volume until you can't hear the sound it emits. You do this for every hertz range until you are finished. Turn it on and forget it's running! Go download this now.",
            "Probably one of the best EQ out there because you can adjust many bands. But the only downside is that for it to run, you will need to keep it on the recent apps and don't kill it because even if there's the notification saying that it's running, it's not. I'm rooting for this app 'cause it has the potential to be one of the best equalizers out there.",
            "I like my Pixel 4XL and bought some really nice Sony wireless buds. Liked the combo but felt like sound could be a little better. Installed the free version of this app and teste out. 10 minutes later, I upgraded to the Premium version. All I can say is WOW!!! With premium, I was able to set up separate profiles for my car and my BT portable speaker. Your developers are GOOD!",
            "This is really good literally it was like wearing glasses for the first time but with sound you could literally hear the beat way better you definitely need to try this app it did decrease the sound which made it less noticeable you should also turn it off and on and focus on the music make sure you set it up right tho"

Get hearing tested, and use devices prescribed by professionals.  Try this app to explore how apps can improve speech comprehension.\r\n\r\nWhen you first use the app, be careful not to increase volume too high.  Volume can be adjusted using your Android volume buttons.  But if you don't want to change your Android volume levels, you should use the Volume screen to set overall volume depending on the environment you are in, and use the Equalizer screen to customize for each ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss usually affects the high frequency range of hearing.  Hearing aid devices can compensate for this by increasing the volume on the Hi-Band.  This can improve comprehension of fricative sounds like 't' and 'sh' ('show' and 'sow' or 'table' and 'cable' are often confused, if you have age-related hearing loss).\r\n\r\nHowever, hearing loss may not always be at the high-frequency end, and may affect younger people as well.  Which is why testing is important, to figure out which frequency bands require boosting to compensate for the specific hearing loss in each ear.  The Hearing Aid device is then programmed to boost the frequency bands which require compensation.\r\n\r\nThis app provides a simple 3-band Equalizer.  Since it only has 3 volume settings to adjust, it may be easier for users to judge which settings work better for them.  Usually for age-related hearing loss, you will improve comprehension by boosting the Hi-Band on the Equalizer.  Other users may prefer other settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarphones/headset, Lapel mic, or device microphone\r\n\r\nUse earphones or headset for best results.  In a pinch, you can use the Android device's built-in earpiece to listen, while using the same device's built-in microphone - however, this approach will lead to feedback at higher volumes (the device microphone will hear the output of the device's earpiece or speaker, which is a feedback loop, which creates an unpleasant whine sound).  If you use an external lapel microphone, then you can use the built-in earphones on device to listen.\r\n\r\nIt is best to use earphones to listen, while using the device microphones to record.  Or use a lapel microphone, or USB microphone for better quality.  Whichever configuration you choose, test for latency - some combinations give lower latency (better) than others.  Usually this will give the lowest latency: using a headset (with built-in mic) or plugging a Y-splitter into the android earphone jack, and plugging in separate earphone and separate microphone into the Y-splitter.\r\n\r\nBluetooth headsets can be used, but usually have much higher latencies (bluetooth latency is high on android), so may be more confusing to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLow latency / Fast response (Oreo Audio)\r\n\r\nThis app makes use of the audio improvements in Android Oreo.\r\n\r\nIf you like the low latency quality of the app, please support by purchasing the app.\r\n\r\nIf you paid for the app, but are not satisfied, please click Menu - Contact to e-mail us for a refund.

        "description": "Convert your mobile phone into a remote control for your HANSATON hearing system: \r\nwith the miniMedia app.\r\n\r\nWorth knowing\r\nThe brand new miniMedia app sets new standards. This is because in combination with HANSATON miniMedia, the app allows not only for easy volume adjustment and program selection on your hearing system. With the miniMedia app, you can also select audio sources that are connected to the miniMedia via cable, transmitter or Bluetooth®, and which can thus stream directly into your hearing system. In this manner, your hearing system becomes a headset for your Bluetooth-enabled Smartphone, or even turns into cordless headphones with an almost perfect sound.\r\n\r\nNote: HANSATON hearing systems require that the miniMedia app be used together with Bi-Com technology and miniMedia (Firmware Version 5 or newer) as bases. \r\n\r\nREMOTE CONTROL: All available miniMedia functions can be controlled from your mobile phone.\r\n\r\nDIRECT ACCESS: The miniMedia app offers you the possibility of switching between different program settings.

With the miniMedia app, you can also select audio sources that are connected to the miniMedia via cable, transmitter or Bluetooth®, and which can thus stream directly into your hearing system. In this manner, your hearing system becomes a headset for your Bluetooth-enabled Smartphone, or even turns into cordless headphones with an almost perfect sound.<br><br>Note: HANSATON hearing systems require that the miniMedia app be used together with Bi-Com technology and miniMedia (Firmware Version 5 or newer) as bases. <br><br>REMOTE CONTROL: All available miniMedia functions can be controlled from your mobile phone.<br><br>DIRECT ACCESS: The miniMedia app offers you the possibility of switching between different program settings.

Therefore, the app is not ideal for me, as I learn music in the Romanic system. I will give you five if you correct that. French is not available.",
