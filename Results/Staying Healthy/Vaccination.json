            "Incomplete information, for example the list of adverse side effects. Watch dr. Suzanne Humphries videos you will get a way better picture than this app. A little example: There have been above 500 deaths of the Gardasil vaccine in addition to many cases of paralysis, still death and paralysis is NOT listed as a adverse reaction. This is brainwashing people!",
            "I wish there was a 0 stars. This is a pile of misinformation and highlights out of context. If you want to be mislead, this is the app for you. If you actually want to learn, read the inserts and the why of the components. Visit a graveyard from before the vaccine for diptheria. Witness the countless tombstones for children. Learn all you can from people who understand that the dose makes the poison. Or, have a measles party and end up in the ICU. Google it.",
            "The author does not know the difference between adverse reactions and adverse events, and conflating the two is a sure sign that the author is an amateur in this arena, along with the fact that he includes the Vitamin K shot in the list of vaccines. Guess anything that comes from a needle is a \"vaccine.\" Author also fails to note the rate of adverse events in the vaccinated group versus the placebo group - in many cases, they are virtually the same. The app seems to have been created in order to sell their MLM-based \"TRS Detox\" spray, as the \"vaccine help\" link contains that information and nothing else. There is no need for the author to respond with the copy/paste paragraph about vaccine court compensation. Everyone acknowledges that the vaccine court has paid out approximately 4 billion dollars to approximately 6,000 claimants since 1986. In the same time period, several hundred million vaccines have been administered, so the court payout data supports the statistics stating that true vaccine reactions are less than 1 in 1,000,000.",
            "It's nice to have a tool for easy accessibility to factual information on the subject of vaccines without the information being filtered or screened or removed. I will be sharing wity everyone I know to ensure they have access to informed consent. Thank you for creating this app.",
            "Very informative & unbiased. Makes it easy to research the vaccine ingredients & reactions all in one place, straight from the manufactures' package inserts. There are ads. I'm going to pay the 1.99 for the ad free version!"

Also if ypu can add in the dewormer section the dosage administered and if it is a shot rather than capsul or liquid! Other than that the app is great and easy to use!",
            "Wasn't impressed. For being a no frills app, it's not as easy to set up as it should be. Wouldn't let me input a wt on the 3mos age because \"this age already exists\"... uh, no kidding, but there's no weight there beside the age, umm, hello? Couldn't change the wt from kg to lbs either. I'm just looking for a basic vaccine & weight record app, that's not connected to my vet, & that's SIMPLE 2 use... sorry but this isn't it.",

I can't remember all that stuff and lose the paperwork, so this is great for me. Also comes in handy at the vet if I need to describe any symptoms; they're already in my notes in the app. I really like that it's streamlined and categorizes my info clearly. Highly recommend. Have not downloaded the upgrades, as I don't want to take the chance any of my data will be affected.",
            "There are limited good apps for pet management. this app is very good with an easy interface. I strongly recommend it for pet owners that don't need to share the info with someone else. However for two partners caring for a pet it becomes cumbersome as the changes aren't shared across the cloud. Please add this feature!",

Negatives:  - Dates can be tedious to enter using calendar (scrolling forwards/backwards a month at a time, especially for DOB!).  - No feedback when saving some info (eg update User Details, setting \"next due\" date for a vaccine).  Press the \"save\" button, nothing seems to happen, but it turns out the info has actually been saved.  I'd prefer it to return to previous screen  - Have to pay for Backup Option, that's OK, but I'd want more options than DropBox if I have to pay for it (eg Google Drive, local folder).

It's confusing as you open it to confirm that you have done something (ie: given meds at the right time) but you can't click \"done\" there and then as it takes you to a future repeat instead of the one you want.",
            "I use this app to track my pets' medications and grooming. It is awesome. Also, their support staff is very responsive to feedback, and the app has only gotten better over the year or so that I have been using it.",
            "I find it very usefull and it helps me a lot not to forget the monthly medications of my dog. However, I did not find option to fill out dog's pregnancy and to set an alarm for the expected period of delivery. It would be nice to have this added as an feature.",
            "It would be great app if reminders were working. I have set medication cycles but no notification comes up when its due. I also changed it to be alarm and use system alarm, but nothing here, too. Also \"feedback and suggestions\" link is just opening sharing screen and not some contact form. Failed to upload picture from both camera or gallery, sent the error reports. Blog and Help sections are just giving me \"failed to connect wifi\" although the app is syncing without problems. (Pixel 3)",
            "What an amazing app! I've had pets for over 25 years, but on getting a new smartphone was looking for something exactly like this to keep track of things. It is feature-rich, easy to use and with great support. Thank you for developing it. 🤠 Edit... I have used this app for some months now and I've come to the conclusion that it is just far too complicated to use! Everytime I go to do something simple it is not intuitive to use."

This app should be showing Cumulative egg collection by week, month and year... That will be more helpful for us. And please try to solve crashing app when I edit the expenditure... It crashes every time. And sold out chickens from particular batches should be counted in flock management and to be removed in counting of overall chickens.",

Recomende",
            "it doesn't let me edit the date i collected eggs if i forgot to enter a day. whenever I pick a different date and hit save, it defaults to the current date. same if i edit an entry. it updates the date to the current date instead of keeping the date it was entered. and i dont like that there is no monthly summaries for collection. just running summaries."

The app allows the health workers to use a tablet to register children for vaccination services. The app also allows longitudinal follow up of children until they are 5 years irrespective of which health facility they receive services. Some of the services recorded through the app includes: child registration, vaccinations, weight, vitamin A, deworming, and insecticide treated nets (ITNs). The key benefits for the health worker using the app includes: reduced time to search patients at the clinic through use of tablets, clinical decision support, longitudinal follow up of children for the entire immunization schedule irrespective of which facilities they attend, quick identification of defaulters for follow up, reduced burden of daily and monthly aggregate reporting which will be available through the tablet. The expected outcome is improved coverage and timeliness of vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe KIP app is built using Open Smart Register Platform (OpenSRP) which is android based open-source software that has previously been deployed for immunization platforms in other countries.",

The same thing happens to \"Resend Confirmation Email\", though it actually says that an email is sent when I haven't received anything in four days. Please help. Beyond frustrating.",
            "Updated: Support contacted me right away and helped me determine that it was the font size setting on my phone..not the app itself! Thank you for the quick response! I have had the app for just over a year now, but recently I have been unable to schedule appointments through the request section. It will let me select all the information but there is no option to submit the request.",
            "Like it so far. Have 2 pets on it and easy to find what I need to know about their health needs. Con: Very hard to read the text, needs to be brighter; headings are fine but the detailed text just too light....please correct this. Wish I could pull this app up on my laptop for easier reading but still like it even if it's on mobile.",
            "I'm new to the app so when I swipe to accept the terms and conditions, it doesn't progress. It just stays on that page and I can't scroll or anything...",
            "A handy app especially if you have more than one pet. It needs some big improvements on the menu text colors. Text colors are so light it makes it hard to see and read. Try adding some options to overcome this."

            "Makes such an important difference going to the Dr when you can say exactly when something started and you can report symptoms you forgot about. Unfortunately • I can't load a photo in the profile (\"Unable to load photo\" error message). • I'd love a search feature so I can tell the Dr when a particular event last happened. • It would be nice to also be able to change symptom icons too. Fix these 3 things and I'll rate a well deserved 5/5.",
            "This app is exactly what I needed! I've been using a notebook to record all the symtoms, medication, doctor visit, etc. in the past two years. I no longer need to write them anymore. Love the electronic recording app! Thank you developers for this great app! I highly recommended!!",
            "You can't add notes without upgrading, which is kind of a basic feature. I want to simply mark if they are healthy or sick for the day. If they are sick then second level would be something like \"has a sore throat\", or fever. I don't want to look through a list of 50 illness to find fever. It just didn't work for me.",
            "I'm using Medicalog to keep track of my kids' conditions and Medications, especially when treating them at home and they are all sick. Con- the entries come under a date, but without a time stamp. I have to add the times of the medication given manually as a note.",
            "Does not work! I upgraded to full version in order to get full benefit of the app. Will not let me add any medications. Have to scroll through a huge list of obscure diseases just to get to something simple like fever."

            "Good app but could be better. I love that more than one person can track activities for the dog. That was the feature I missed in the other app I use. There are a lot more options for tracking compared to other apps (eg. Play, training, walk, etc). A major limitation that is preventing me from switching completely to this app is that you can't track overnight sleeps. If my dog started sleeping at 11pm and woke up at 7am - this app will say it is not a valid time.",
            "So far I'm really loving this app. I would like to keep up with the times that my pup uses the restroom and would like to keep her on a schedule. Cons: The log for the activities shows the start of the day of the day at the bottom of the list. And has the entry part blocking it so you can't even see it. No reminders the app glitches and shuts down. I wish there was a way you can add an activity for multiple pups so you don't have to go into each individual account to add the same thing.",
            "I wish it worked. It seems perfect but when I try to set a reminder it exits out of the app and doesn't set my reminder. Please fix asap. I would love to use this.",

            "Does the job. Easy to use. Wish you could add/edit your own activities like vomit and turn off/delete those that aren't useful. Adding multiple at the same time would make this a great app."

            "I absolutely LOVE this app I use it every single day, it's gotten to the point where if we're having a really busy day I definitely rely on the app to tell me when it's time for a bottle or diaper, I love that it gives you a timeline and that you can adjust and tweak everything down to the minute but also the app is very easy to navigate. Fantastic app and I've already recommended it to my other expecting mom friends!",
            "just found this app and after some testing it seems very nice & super easy to use BUT with no ability to sync data between the two parents (or even two devices). I'm impressed with the \"dad\" setting but what's the use of it if it doesn't sync with the \"mom\" in order to know what's my next action, let's say? is this a paid option or.. am I blind? overall seems a well-designed and pretty easy to use, app!",
            "Does exactly what I need: lets me easily log feeds as I'm doing them, including which breast I'm feeding from. Really helpful with the diapering as well- allows you to just log what's in the nappy (pee, poo or both) but with the option to add comments about the diapers as well. It's very simple to use and the summary displays are helpful for keeping track of what's happening. I'm a first time mum, and it helps keep my anxiety low to have an accurate record of what is going in and out!",
            "So easy to use. Makes tracking a breeze especially when you're half asleep at 3am feeding. The edit feature is also great if you forget to log off. Love that you can add in photos and chart growth/ sleeping patterns. The only improvement I can think of would be a pause button when feeding. I highly recommend this free app!.",
            "This app has been a life saver. As a mum to multiple children my mummy brain has kicked in and I can't remember when I last did anything or which side I last fed on. With this app I'm able to check in seconds when something was last done and its suprising how often I think its only been an hour and its actually been several hours. I'm also able to monitor his general health and it gives me peace of mind. Its a very well made app, very useful and simple enough to use. Thank you."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Awesome so far! 👶 OMG the way you can track your child's growth chart even see the % of their growth compared to normal babies. Also can add collaborators to read or add info to crate this awesome experience! Online baby photo book that backs up. Baby 101 info or searchable reading info that shows the source info so you can be assured that it's reliable stuff. Also baby quizzes so you can test your knowledge. Total 1 stop shop.",
            "We loved this app for our first child. However, our new baby is 3 weeks old and I have not been able to add my husband as a collaborator, so it's kind of useless until I can. The email that he receives appears to have a link that says \"Accept Invite\". However, it's not clickable. Is there another way for him to accept my invite to be added as a collaborator?",
            "I like the tracking options but I would not suggest this app to anyone. I am a nanny and have 2 babies to take care of. Half the time the app lags or doesn't save my information I put in. It is SOOOO frustrating and a waste of my time away from the babies to literally re-input 1/4 of what I already typed in. I've been using it for 10 months and I'm switching because it gets me so frustrated.",
            "this app initially worked well, but once we had over 1,000 photos for our first child and we added our second child we started having tons of issues. not worth the frustration. we are moving to a different app because of all the issues. I did like the little weekly and monthly informational bites."

Also, there is no option to store the information on the phone's SD card. It would be nice if you could attach several photos to your pet's profile. And it would be nice to have a separate shot record for each pet, so an owner could look up the date of the last Rabies vaccine shot.",

The simple user interface makes it a great tool even for those not so familiar with modern technology.\r\n\r\n✓ This app is perfect for patients of all ages. Particularly for seniors to eliminate missing a dose.\r\n\r\n✓ It enables you to schedule various medications with multiple doses at different times of day.\r\n\r\n✓ It Offers simple, modern and clean user interface.\r\n\r\n✓ Website access available at https://web.pillreminderapp.com\r\n\r\n✓ It securely stores your medication history and you can generate weekly, monthly, or yearly reports to help your specialist with the progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe app comprises 5 major sections: \r\n\r\n\r\n💢 Medication Reminder\r\n💢 New Measurements\r\n💢 Doctor Visit\r\n💢 Vaccine Reminders\r\n💢 Water intake & Diet Tracker\r\n\r\nHere’s what each section does:\r\n\r\nMEDICATION REMINDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is where you manage all of your medications. Here you set reminders for each medication to avoid missing doses. Notifications remind you to follow your medication regimen.\r\n\r\nTo set reminders, you will first need to indicate whether you are taking pills, syrups, or injections. You can set reminders on them collectively or separately, depending on how you use them. Daily reminders, weekly reminders, monthly reminders, and yearly reminders are all available.\r\n\r\nAnother great feature of this section is Inventory Setting. Here you can enter the number of medications left in your medical box and tell it to send an alert when you are left with a certain number.

For example, the normal blood pressure reading is 120/80. Also, this section creates a timeline of each reading on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Using this timeline, your physician can easily monitor your results.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTOR VISITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a great feature that helps you to set reminders in order to keep track of upcoming doctor appointments.\r\n\r\nFirst thing you will need to do is to add the doctor to the Pill Tracker App. Next, you will enter the date and time at which the visit will occur.\r\n\r\n💢 An awesome thing about this section is that it lets you record the audio of the entire conversation between you and doctor by their consent. \r\n\r\nDoctors often give you a lot of information quickly. This will help you keep record of the doctor’s advice and replay as necessary to confirm your understanding. Also, the Important Note feature in this section helps you take written notes of everything that the doctor says. \r\n\r\nVACCINE REMINDERS\r\n\r\nTimely vaccinations are important to ensure healthy growth of your child. To make things easier, use the\r\n\r\nVaccine Reminder feature \r\n\r\nof our app. Here you will find numerous vaccination schedule templates.\r\n\r\nThe section has two features:\r\n\r\n✓Active Vaccines\r\n✓Schedule Vaccines\r\n\r\nIn Active Vaccines, there is a list of vaccines that you can select from to indicate the ones your child has already received.

Also I have to calculate the days on the calendar till the exact day for the med will last, while you could simply ask for the number of days.",
            "This app would be ok if you are only taking one medication at each notification. I take 6 different meds at 8:30. It's a pain to mark one, then have to scroll back down the list the mark the next one. And it's very hard to change the time for a med. As soon as I find another one, I will delete this app.",
            "It could be great. But the reminder only goes off one time. If you don't hear it, it will not remind you again. would be nice if it would alert every few minutes until you respond, at least a few times.",
            "I'm impressed by the sophistication of the app, and how great the level of detail is when creating medications and setting up reminders. Unfortunately this isn't matched by its usability: navigating the different sections is quite clunky. The most frustrating aspect of this app is confirming medications were correctly admnistered, using the controls inside the notifications pop-ups. These are a great idea, however they don't work as expected, which in my case resulted in inaccurate stats.",
            "It's a really good app. However I'm taking away 1 star for some annoying features. When you get the pop-up you can click you've taken it or to snooze it (cool feature) but then it takes you to the app (WHY?!), instead of going away like a normal notification. And then, whenever you wanna exit the app, it asks you for confirmation. Both things are annoying and unnecessary!"

            "Otp through message never came. Finally after 4-5 tries got opt via call. Since then it's stuck at validating credential. Tried clearing out cache etc but nothing seems to be helping. Worst experience. Don't say it it's internet issue. If I can put review means internet working. Tried will other no as well. Also on other device as well",
            "Their home vaccination service is just a mess! They have an app to book appointments and yet, you cannot book a home vaccination through the app. You have to email their representative for it. When you email their representative, you receive no reply! To book a simple home visit is a pointlessly huge hassle! The home visit is more like a raid because the staff are reluctant to reveal when they will come to your house. They come all of a sudden when you least expect it. Very unprofessional!",
            "Not working... Not able to register online. Neither does the OTP come, nor does the \"OTP over call\" work. Waste of time. Update: Tried with a diff number too. still doesn't work. Went to the hospital, tried the same in front of Reception staff (well they made me do it, kept trying for 15 mins at reception). Still same. Then they did manual billing. Other users also had similar issue. So you need to do some work guys. I have no interest in this app, just helped by providing this feedback.",
            "Good app for video consultations with doctor. Also got my kid home vaccinated on schedule and hassle free.",
            "This is a terrible way to lure people to pay 750 for an econsultation that goes on for 4 mins where the doc says please come to the hospital for consultation, it's safe. You go there and get charged another 900 for consultation/ vaccination and this happens less than 24 hrs after online consultation. You don't know when the doctor will show up for the e-apointment and you have to keep it on till she comes. We waited for 40mins. A big thumbs down for this haphazardly made bridge gap arrangement."

            "Edit: nearly a year later, we're still using it every day. It's been great to review my kiddo's trends over time as we evaluate sleep needs with daycare and weaning to solid foods. After a rough start to our baby's first few days, we had to keep close watch over her food intake and wet/dirty diapers. This app with its Alexa integration has made it easy to log and view the data we need, completely hands-free while changing diapers or calming a screaming baby. Highly recommend!",
            "This app is generally good but there are bugs with timings (started a nursing timer, tried to finish it after the time has passed and it messes up the duration. I frequently have to delete the entry and reenter it manually and sometimes even then it messes up!)",
            "The app makes it easy to track everything. My wife has an iPhone, so it is incredible that it works on Android, iOS and web. The Google Assistant integration is amazing, since your hands are always full. It seems like everything I want is possible: * How long since the last feed? The time is overlaid on the feeding icon. * How is today going at a glance? Tap the summary tab. * How has the last week been? Tap the graph tab. etc",
            "Overall good but no difference between day/night logs! It would be great if there was a way to differentiate between day and night. It doesn't help me to see the intervals of nursing, sleep etc. in a 24h period! It would make the app a lot more attractive to have that difference of day and night logs",
            "So helpful to remember when you've last fed baby and therefore when you next expect to feed again. Loved that it could also be linked to my partners phone."

            "Excellent, well thought out app. Got everything you will need to track things. Great that there are versions for other platforms too. My wife has an iPhone and I have android and this syncs perfectly between the two. Been a huge help for both of our children. My daughter had bowel surgery and we struggled with feeding, and this app meant we had all the data at our fingertips when we talked to doctors and dieticians about her progress. So thank you, whoever built this. I highly recommend it.",
            "Amazing for ADHD mom's!! Or busy ones!! Has a widget and you don't have to pay!!! Such a blessing!! Only 2 suggestions - 1. Fix the timers to where they will go off if the app is \"sleeping\" and 2. Have a running clock for nursing with a stop button on the lock screen! That would be amazing!! But absolutely love this app!",
            "So helpful for a new mom who would never carry around a paper chart nor remember last feeding start time or side. I love that the timer continues to run even when I leave the app since sometimes I use my phone for other things while feeding. Also adding a diaper change is only like 3 taps so super convenient which was especially nice in the first few days when we were counting each diaper!",
            "Very useful but sometimes doesn't save/sync entries. My husband and I both use it on our phones and sometimes it doesn't save entries from one phone to the other. Sometimes it doesn't save entries at all. This is a new issue, in the past 2 days so hopefully it can be fixed quickly.",
            "Love having the app to keep track of everything baby. I check it most often to see when was the last time I fed him when I'm too tired to remember which day is which. It also has been helpful during his check-ups when I have answers, dates and times for the pediatrician."

Off late it was crashing frequently, but after the new update, I don't see those crashes. Hope it works well.",

Also, I am unable to use decimals in the calculators. I am reviewing rhis app for a presentation and I think it has great potential. I will keep trying to work with it."

            "I use to have this app on my old phone and never had an issue. I downloaded it again when I got my Galaxy s10e and I cannot log in at all. I hit the help option to get an email to reset my password and I NEVER receive an email no matter how many times I try. It is incredibly frustrating trying to keep up with my dogs exams shots etc if I can't look online. I work log days and don't have time to sit on the phone trying to figure out appointments. Please fix this asap.",
            "The chat feature on this is enough to give 5 stars alone. 24/7 chat support with a vet is awesome. We have had some times when our dog was sick but we didn't know if it was something urgent or not. Being able to ask and get confirmation gives us peace of mind. Please never lose this feature!!",
            "Very bad. I am told about the app and I have seriously tried to sign in and create an account on several occasions and each and every time I have tried to log in to the account I have more issues than I can count. Then I have tried just signing in with my Facebook account/page and now it tells me to put in my mobile number and Facebook password, and that's not even correct. DAMNIT TO ALL HELL. WTH is up with this foolishness? I love my dog and will always love my dog, but is really insane!!!!!",
            "This app is super easy to use and I find it super convient. I like that I can schedule appointments easily, find locations, and have all of the records on hand for reference, boarding, etc. I've reccomended it to people in line at Banfield because not everyone knows about it/thinks anything of it.",
            "I cannot make an appointment. I get to the part to select a location and the date just keeps changing. Next does not highlight. App also keeps crashing. UPDATE: I did as instructed and was told that I needed to call the hospital directly to make the appointment. Even after I explained that I was instructed by the digital team to call to receive help with the app, I was told no one could do anything about issues with the app."

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "What an amazing game, a wonderful way to educate people but its a bit tough 😅. Love the Concept & gameplay. Good job guys, keep it up, looking forward to more games like this 🤗👍 Btw I heard about the game when watching the Scishow episode. Edit: Just looked at the other games you've made after i posted the review, going to install them now. Thanks guys",
            "A fun small way to educate and simplify how vaccines work and are made. But as a game though it could be expanded on more and improved. Navigation UI is terrible it's hard to get to the patients in time. Levels could also be better spaced in terms of difficulty. Otherwise a fun minigame to raise awareness.",
            "Great game but had a bad problem with the screen always going back to the last screen when i was making the vaccines. It got so annoying that i stopped playimg the game. Right now im giving it 2* because of that. Fix the problem & i will give it 5*",
            "The game did teach about how vaccines are made and it was a decent game, however it was way too short, took me about 30 minutes to finish it and it's not worth doing it again for a higher score. Learned about it from SciShow on youtube",
            "Good idea but the awkward sizing and UI mean that cows die way too quickly before you can navigate to them and give them antibiotics. I also sometimes got stuck inside a cow's mouth and couldn't go back without swanbing the disease again, wasting valuable time."

        "description": "Cards. They’ve been around for literally centuries. They have long-lasting appeal.\r\n\r\nSolitaire. Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire. If boredom was as life-threatening as children proclaim, solitaire would have saved tens, possibly hundreds, of millions of lives. No joke. \r\n\r\nTriPeaks. Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it.

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

            "Good app. I needed it to find out how much milk my little one was getting every feed. I hate having to calculate his weight to ounces, especially in the middle of the night. If I could enter pounds and ounces there this app would have gotten a 5 star rating... this was on the verge of a 3 because I'm so annoyed with that part.",
            "Very helpful app. With little sleep that moms get - the app helps to have everything recorded. User friendly, everything is intuitive. Recommend.",
            "Very good app. User friendly. Gave 4 stars as sometimes the play/pause button freezes and doesn't work.",
            "I'm a first time parent that has been using this app since Day 1 of my son's life and it's been really helpful. Might take getting used to always remember to update things on it, but works wonders. Especially when I'm tired and I want to backtrack his record for the last few hours to see what was completed and for how long. Highly recommended to first time parents. You will certainly enjoy it.",
            "Helpful. I'm using app from begging of baby adventure and I need to admit I am already addicted. Sometimes app changes language itself to English, despite I have set other one in settings."

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "UGGGHHH!!! I've been playing this for a while now and I had tons of ship parts and money and after I went and updated I lost everything I worked so hard for. I hope that glitch gets fixed. But overall I love this game but it should be easier to upgrade your ship. Thanks",
            "I have never quit a game the same day i started it, until now. And odds are more money is made by the ads than the players. I was excited when i started playing too many bugs and bad choices by the devs or management however.",
            "Predatory gambling and political ads ruin what could have been a fun experience. Edit - Cookie cutter reply from Devs fails to address my concerns. Gameplay is good, predatory ads for malware or gambling are not.",
            "Beginnings are fun, but later it's unplayable for free users. Too many ads, repetitive, unjust, unfair. At some point, progressing is limited to paying customers, upgrading your ships above certain levels is available only after buying crystals or cards. You don't receive enough of them during normal game. Ads can break the sound in the game, and pause your music. Free users are limited to 20 games at a time. Then you need to wait for energy to replenish.",
            "I updated the app to this latest version and lost all my ship and drone upgrades!!! That sucked biiiiiiiig time and deserved 1/5. 🌟 But the compensation received in the in-app mail was more than enough and deserves a 5-star rating...have your 5/5 🌟 as a sign of gratitude from yours truly."
