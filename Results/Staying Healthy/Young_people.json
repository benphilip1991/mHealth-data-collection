        "description": "HappiMe is an exciting and innovative app for Young People and Teenagers app, designed to help you to:\r\n•\tWorry less\r\n•\tBe less anxious\r\n•\tBe more confident\r\n•\tImprove your self-esteem\r\n•\tBe happier\r\n\r\nThere is also a version of this app for children and adults!\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n•\tStep One – LEARN \r\n\r\nAn engaging video that explains the way the brain works using “The Chimp and The HappiTars”. Your chimp is the part of your brain that worries and tells you that you can’t do stuff! Your HappiTar - your Happiness Avatar - is the part of your brain that cheers you on and tells you that you CAN do it! The app teaches you how to recognise who is in control, and how to tell your chimp brain to… “Back off!”\r\n\r\n•\tStep Two – RECOGNISE \r\n\r\nThe fun swipe game teaches you the difference between a helpful thought and an unhelpful one! This is where you start to recognise your unhelpful self-talk.\r\n\r\n•\tStep three – DEAL WITH YOUR EMOTIONS \r\nThe Mini-Mindful Bites section contains relaxation audios and videos on mindfulness, meditation, visualisation and HappiTapping to help you to understand - and deal with - your emotions and feelings.\r\n\r\n•\tStep four – REPLACE \r\n\r\nThe playlist feature is where you start replacing your thoughts with more helpful ways of thinking. You can create multiple playlists of helpful thoughts from hundreds of pre-recorded audios. Choose from audios to increase confidence, reduce anxiety, improve health, deal with friendship issues, develop self-belief and boost self-esteem. You can even record your own helpful thoughts if you want to! Then simply choose a backing track (or upload your own), hit 'continuously play' and listen as often as you can to start changing the way you think!\r\n \r\nThe app uses the following proven tools and techniques in a fun and engaging way, to introduce you to the power of helpful thoughts and thinking positively: \r\n•\tCBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy)\r\n•\tNLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) \r\n•\tHappiTapping (EFT - Emotional Freedom Technique) \r\n•\tMindfulness  \r\n•\tPositive Psychology \r\n•\tVisualisation (Positive Mental Rehearsal)\r\n \r\nJoin the HappiMe 30-Day Challenge to win prizes! Each time you use the app you build points... And points mean prizes! Check out the '30-Day Challenge' link on the app. \r\n\r\nThere is a children’s, teenager’s and adult’s version of this app. The apps for children and teenagers are completely free. The profit from the adult app will help pay for the free version for children and will ensure those apps remain free forever! We have managed to keep the cost of the adult version so low by creating an exact duplicate of the children’s version – with different audios, videos and playlists of course! \r\nHappiMe is a Community Interest Company – all profits from the adult version of the app are re-invested to spread the HappiMe message! \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT!\r\nHappiMe contains 100’s of audios files, so it’s a big ole app. It may be best to download it when you are using Wi-Fi! \r\nAlso, to keep the app size as small as we can, we have hosted the videos on YouTube, so you will need an internet connection to view them.\r\nDon't forget to enable push notifications so we can keep you motivated! \r\nAnd lastly, you can create multiple users per app if you would like to share the apps with your family members .\r\n\r\nGood luck!",

I absolutely love the task facility, my child has special needs so the fact that I can make appropriate, simplified tasks for her to achieve is just brilliant, and rewarding for both of us.",
            "It's good, but feels a bit steep, top up fee is same for topping up £20 or £25... Not had long enough to see if it's different for bigger amounts. Notifications are hit and miss too, sometimes coming a while after the event, reminder to tick off tasks sometimes happens, sometimes late, sometimes not at all. It's great for my kids to learn about money management, but there are some bugs",
            "Dissapointing I love the concept, then I went to activate card and load it. Its $4.99 to add $10 on top of a monthly fee thats more then i pay for my own card. Then i get to the payment page and you cant use prepaid cards like Netspend, Western Union etc. You have to have a brick and mortar bank account which is a little hypocritical considering this is a prepaid card. I was excited to use this with my son unfortunatley we wont be. Thankfully there is other options.",
            "The app is brilliant for controlling spending, it can be linked to ps4 so stops my children spending on my card. I had a problem today due to my child giving their bank details to someone (his fault) and Go Henry staff handled it so well and so efficiently, I couldn't fault them at all. The app alerted me to someone trying to spend all the money in the account so I knew there was something wrong and managed to block the card and change the password with in minutes. ☆☆☆☆☆"

In each session a member of this team introduces them to one of seven CBT concepts that unfold during the course of the game.

            "This stupid app is glitchy as hell. My camera wouldn't work in it to take a photo. I forgot password so I hit \"send code\" but I have to minimize the app to open the email and when I go back it's at the sign up or login page again...ridiculous.",

Don't waste your time.",

        "description": "NYAS stands for the National Youth Advocacy Service. NYAS is the leading national provider of advocacy for children and young people. We also provide advocacy services for children and young people in Wales. We provide lots of services and some services for adults. Our main service though is advocacy for children and young people. NYAS is a rights based charity. \r\n\r\nIf you are a care leaver, in care, have been told that there is to be  a child protection conference about you, if you are disabled, then you have the right to an advocate. You may be entitled to an advocate for another reason. We also provide mental health advocates if you are unwell and in hospital. \r\n\r\nAn independent advocate will help you to be heard when important decisions are being made about your life. An advocate will go to meetings with you if that is what you want. They will help you to talk about your wishes and feelings. If you find meetings difficult they will support you. Sometimes they will go to meetings for you if that is what you want. An advocate will help you to start, change or stop something in your life. They will also talk to you about your rights and entitlements so that you can make the right choices and decisions about your life.\r\n\r\nThe free NYAS advocacy app gives you direct contact with the NYAS helpline if you need an advocate. It also contains useful information about what your rights are if you are in care (including mental health settings), if you are a care leaver or if there are child protection issues about you. It is a quick reference for professionals too about advocacy and the services NYAS provides.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n\r\n•\tRemote access to NYAS helpline wherever you are – this means that if you have a mobile phone you can contact the helpline by phone, email or Skype. You don’t need  Wi-Fi to use the app. If you email us and want us to call you back, we will do this. Our helpline is open 9 a.m. - 8 p.m. Mondays – Fridays and 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. on Saturdays.\r\n\r\n•\tInformation for young people about getting involved with NYAS – At NYAS we have a Participation Team who provide opportunities for young people in care and care leavers to be involved in the charity and to develop their skills. For example we have trained young people as peer advocates so that they can then go on to be professional advocates. This gives them something to put on job application forms too. More information can be found on the NYAS Young person’s website at http://youngpeople.nyas.net\r\n\r\n•\tInformation about NYAS Legal Services – The legal team at NYAS support children and young people when their parents are in court because they cannot agree about which parent should look after their children. NYAS is asked to represent children and young people so that their wishes and feelings are taken into account in these proceedings.\r\n\r\n•\t Information about staying safe and links to relevant websites – It is our responsibility to make sure that you are safe whenever we are working with you. We will keep confidential what you tell us unless we believe that you may not be safe, or that another child or young person may not be safe.\r\n\r\n•\tFurther information can be found at www.nyas.net  and http://youngpeople.nyas.net\r\n\r\nFollow us on (Twitter icon) @NYASServices and (Twitter icon) @NYASFundraising\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow us on twitter @NYASServices and @NYASFundraising",

            "in theory, the idea is there. but the rules of the app is so stupid. you can't do much in the app instead of just being active tbh. the admins have way too much control, and honestly just a waste of time. you're better off finding lesbian friends somewhere else cause this definitely isn't the place.",

            "This app is amazing I made some knew friends too I'm so happy oh and it only for girl not for boy and even you can post pictures of LBTQ IT AMAZING~!!!",
            "It was Fun app, untill i got my stuff taken down though i did do nothing wrong, and then one of the admins gave me a strike even though i was priviously told there would be no strike, if this could be fixed then i will give the app better stars.",
            "In theory great idea, but in reality its against the guidelines to exclude members from groups/chats based on age. This is very inappropriate! I recently made a chat for adults only and it got deleted by admin for being against the rules to exclude underage children. For me, a 22 year old adult, it is extremely inappropriate for me to be engaging with children on the Internet in any way, there are no spaces for us to use, despite my survey showing that half the users are adults! Please respond"

            "This was pretty easy to setup for my elderly mother. If they develop this app more it would make it better..... And could charge $$ more for it. I wish you could adjust size of the icons. And my biggest gripe is that you can put icons on the main/home screen. It only has the dock at the bottom and the clock/weather on the top. There is space for at least a couple of icons. As far as functionality it's simple and easy to select which app you want to use.",
            "Though I overall enjoyed this launcher, the lack of access to notification s really limited this launcher. I really enjoyed the large icons. I would like the ability to arrange my favorite apps and the ability to create folder s. My other struggle s are that when choosing favorite apps, the apps already chosen, were not specified by a check mark by it. Also, I could not consistently open the launcher settings with TalkBack.",

            "I feel like this is a really good app, gives me a little bit of responsibility by waking up my buddy and gets me to go out and do simple but meaningful tasks. It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

There are some premade template stories you can personalised, but you can't read the story before you buy, which is disappointing. I'm not keen buying kids books without having looked through it, to ensure it's appropriate and something they would enjoy reading. But overall a great app.",

This app not only allowed me to create the gifts I wanted, the service was simply outstanding! It seemed as though they were just as concerned about me getting the finished product in time as I was! oh, and the finished product - Superb!",

Lots of pervs too; 18+ ppl message me although I'm 15. The app gives off a creepy atmosphere/vibe too. Horrible user interface as well. I don't recommend downloading this app either way. Just stick to Discord & other normal apps than this one.",

But as soon i tried to open the app again, I can't log in anymore. It only says \"Permission level: ban\". Does that mean that my acc was banned? For what? i didn't even do anything and also it's hard to put up a simple profile photo. I need to download the chat gum app too. I don't know how they're related but that's really hassle.",

When I saw some of the men didn't have to pay, that was the end for me. You cannot easily exchange emails or phone numbers. WARNING DO NOT USE THIS APP OR SITE!!!!!",

At least they should let you chat for free for at least a month after you pay your first time. But NO. IT IS PURE SCAM. I asked for a free month after my first payment and never aswered. RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN.",
            "It's really expensive ☹️. You have to pay right after you send your first message you can't see the reply of your chat mate and you can't reply either because you have to pay first for subscription. Cant it just at least give 1 month free?"

I am currently using the 14 day free Meetly premium trial which is quite good but you don't really need it. The only issue i ever had with the app,was that it kept closing every 10-15 seconds,which was such a pain but that bug seems to be fixed. I just updated the app,so should be even better. You have so many people right on your doorstep. Everyone should download it!!",

Took me forever to get passwords aligned and in place an all that bs. Just to pay to sit and watch a loading swirl laugh at me for wasting money here. Didn't even remember my password I had set for it an do not even know if I can contact the people being that it's only an email address. Nothing else. I have written the email address for help but to no avail",

            "Was an amazing app the for the past year. We have a mix of Apple and Android devices in the house. Swapped from Amazon Music tAmazon. Last year, felt it was worth the money until this month's update. Wow, it is an incredible step backwards in design and functionality. Playlists cannot be re ordered, it takes extra clicks to do any task...they have until Christmas to straighten it out or I'm back to Amazon.",
            "Great music app, no question there. The recent update to the UI has placed your library as the last item in the hotbar at the bottom. Why? The primary function of this app is for people to listen to the music they want. If people want to discover new music, they will select that tab. Don't force people to go there when they open the app. I think the Spotify app opens directly to people's library. I suggest others try Spotify first.",
            "Seems to me you ruined a good app. I don't understand the order of anything or how to get to anything. 'Listen Now' seems a bit useless & redundant, as we already have radio. Have no idea what you all were trying to do here. Also, I know it trivial, but the colors throw me off the most. You even changed the widget I keep on my phone to a bright pink. PINK. The brightness agrivates my migraines, even in dark mode. At least give people a way to change the colors or opt back to the classic app look.",
            "Good for listening. Can be a pain to get music to download to my device and I really wish I had access to podcasts within the app. The latest update is stupid annoying. The listen now, browse and radio option are all basically the same thing, put it back. I hate having my main menu on the right side now. If you're going to do an update make podcasts accessible. It also randomly will pause my music for no apparent reason.",
            "There's an issue with sorting your library. The only options are playlists, artists, albums, songs and downloaded. Theres an edit feature where you can select the desired ways to sort your library but it does not work. I would like to sort by genre. There has been plenty of updates over the years however this issue has never been fixed."

            "I love the Kindle app! Never thought I would read e-books because I prefer to read a physical copy, but with covid and recently down sizing e-books are so much easier to read, and store! They take up no space. Best of all with the free Kindle app you can read books for free. Other books do cost but you do not have to buy anything to be able to read! Book lovers need this app!",
            "This app is well done as expected from Amazon. However, my biggest frustration is that highlighting is based on whole words and not characters. There are times where I will need to highlight one word and the current highlighting system makes it impossible without highlighting other objects around it. There are apps that allow for character based highlighting. Please change this and I will change my review to 5 stars.",
            "Bug-ridden garbage. Latest update 28/1/19 just marked all my books as new & unread when most of them should be partially or wholly read. So much for \"bug fixes\"! October 2020. There's an expression, \"If it ain't bust, don't fix it.\" Doesn't apply in this case. Definitely bust. Oh, and you'll need a magnifier to see the new Aa menu.",
            "The Kindle icon recently disappeared from my screen, so I reinstalled the app. The icon has re-appeared, but when I try to open any book from my library I get a message saying that Kindle has closed. Kindle no longer works on my device (Google Nexus). Does this have anything to do with the upgrade on 15th October ? If this isn't fixed soon I'm going to be asking for a refund for all the Kindle books in my library. Not happy.",
            "App itself is ok, latest update is hot garbage. Honestly I'm amazed they haven't hotfixed it yet, considering all the people who can't use the store at all right now. Pretty tired of getting push notifications, only to select them and get an error when it tries to display a store page. My other major annoyance at the moment - they decided to default to autoscroll instead of page flip, even when you've previously turned it off. How hard is it to just set it according to what the user specified?"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

Please try to fix this, have a good day and thank you for visisting!",
            "As far as an .io game goes, Paper.io has always been one of my favourites. I used to play it way back when you could buy characters with coins. I'd recommend Paper.io to people who just want a simple, fun game to play in their spare time. It runs smoothly, doesn't take up a lot of storage space or battery. I personally don't invest a lot of energy in this game, but I know quite a few people who love it for both its simplicity and bordom-killing abilities.",
            "Paper io. was extremely good last time. Now it's extremely frustrating. Many ppl say that it's difficult to control, and it's only about your own skill and understanding of the game. But the challenges are extremely horrible now. They take a long time to load on this same device (OPPO R9) and it is very laggy when playing the challenges, causing me to crash into walls very often. The normal mode runs so smoothly, why can't the challenges do the same? Please get this fixed.",
            "The game used to be fun, but now the controls suck! It used to be so smooth where you could just glide across. But now it's 90° degree angle turns and hard to control. It was also a lot less complicated. Please make it go back to being smooth.",
            "This game is actually crazy I just wanna say that this is for those who have extra time and they get bored but if they want to play this game they can enjoy, but the worst thing is that if you die in this game you will be very angry, but some have just broked there phones because of that anger"

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

Also the mindfulness section only has 4 things to look at, it would be nice if more were added.",
            "i used clear fear for a while now and im so glad i found it because its really helping. i would give 5 stars if there wasnt this little problem that gets super annoying after while. if you log into the app the first time you answer some questions like selecting which part of the world ur from, set ur passcode and a security question and all of that stuff and i confirmed everything but if i open the app i have to answer all of the questions again, like i havent answered them. please fix that!!",
            "Good app, just two notes. When I try to type a text I cannot scrol the screen down enough to keep seeing the textbox. It disappears behind my keyboard. And I would like some excercises in it that are also in calm harm. It seems that app contains more coping strategies than just cbt and a breathing excercise it also has more interaction than clear fear. But it is a bit weird to read about harm when it is about anxiety. Another option would be to choose in the harm app what one is using it for.",
            "This was an ok app but there are only two things you can do to calm you down. A breathing activity and the same recording of a person telling you how to calm down. Other than that it's just an app to write down goals. There is also no option to record an attack after it happened and instead you must go through one of the activities and say that it helped so that you can record something. Even then it'll not show up for awhile until the week ends. There could be many improvements but its ok.",
            "I was recommended to this application by my therapist, and found the resources in this application helpful. However, I do realise that there is a bug that doesn't save your information when you close out of the application. Therefore, I would have to manually key in all my details from startup again. Other than the issue I mentioned, the application overall is great."

            "Hi, giving feedback because of the updated bible gateway site (which I noticed today is gone?) The only reason I didn't like it was because I usually read the whole chapter from the link, so when I tap to backspace the specific verse numbers, in the new version, the field is now lower on my screen, so my keyboard covers it up while I'm backspacing... it's annoying to have to have to scroll up each time. Maybe try as at the bottom for that page only? Other than that, it was fine. Thx.",

When I found this app, it made a huge improvement to my daily life since I could go to it anywhere anytime. Plus the extras that accompany the daily readings are a wonderful addition. THANK YOU!",

            "I usually read more than one commentary and like that Enduring word is the most comprehensive and usually gives more than one commentary on a scripture. I decided to download the app for easier access. Thank You! God Bless your Ministry!",
            "Absolutely love this app! It helps me understand the bible a lot better! The only thing is that English is not my home language so maybe more languages would be a lot better! But I still highly reccomend!",
            "It's a wonderful app. I have been using it for more than an year. Gives us better understanding when we don't understand the verse properly. I recommend everyone who enjoy reading the Word to download this as it gives you better understanding!!! God bless!!!",
            "Great app very useful when you want to dive deep into EVERY verse and parts of it.. However it would be useful to be able to search a specific verse to find out what that ONE VERSE means in depth and to be able to mark where you left of.. But overall its a GREAT resource for Bible study.",
            "Loving the app, but would love it if you could add the feature where when we open the app again, it takes us back to where we stopped reading. It's kind of time consuming to scroll through the whole chapter. Another feature would be to highlight or separately bookmark certain verses. I do know you have the bookmark option for the chapter. But I would suggest to add these two features as they will help better. The app is definitely informative and helpful and easy to understand. G-d bless."

App doesn't consistently save reading progress and the design is very counterintuitive if you've previously used other eReaders",
            "EDIT: Their audiobook player always jumps back to the start of the book, losing your place. The only reason I am using this app is because the Wall Street Journal provides its free ebooks through it. It constantly forgets the page I'm on, jumps back a random number of pages, and the social features (which you can turn off, thankfully) are so distracting as to make reading impossible. Also, their \"reading encouragement\" notifications are a bizarre mix of Mafia-style intimidation and begging.",
            "App is doing much better about letting me just read. Somehow they decide how much I'm suppose to read ea day but I don't remember committing to that. So I just read when I can and they don't bother me too much about it.",
            "Updated to v2.71 and login issue went away and books sync from mobile to PC. Thank you for the update! Unable to login using my WSJ account. Works just fine online. Please fix the app so I can use Glose on the go."

Please do your best to get this issue fixed.",

To anyone that might be having trouble with creating an account, maybe try using a password database app like Keepass or similar app, which makes creating, managing login info, and logging into apps/sites much easier.",
            "The concept is awesome. It looks like a single developer is implementing the dream of direct democracy. Now that the peoples party has gone from hundreds to thousands, the app can't handle the strain. I tried to vote on an open issue and it just spun. I am sure that with donations and time, this will become ready. The goal is to grow to millions. Sadly that probably means going to AWS or other huge infrastructure.",
            "I have sent an email to the developer and I hope they will see the problem and respond and let me help them figure out how to get it fixed, but as of yet I have been unable to log in and have not received my verification email that I've requested it to resend several times. I am also concerned about the fact that so many people seem to be having the same problem and it looks like there is already a vote going on, which cannot be even remotely democratic under these circumstances.",
            "Took a couple tries to register and log in, but when it worked (third try) it was very quick. The layout is a little dated like others have said but given the purpose of the app I'm MORE than willing to overlook that. I guess it takes a progressive party to figure out app voting."

            "Love this game, beautiful artwork, music, and storyline. The only thing is, the game got deleted but I had fortunately written down my account information. When I reinstalled and logged into my account, the game had been reset. After working hard for everything I had on the account its a bit of a disappointment. Although I was a free player I had fabled heroes, many outfits, fabled pets, lower one rank, etc all gone now. :/ Is there anyway I can have my account back?",
            "Simple yet super addictive game! I'm literally hooked! From the interesting storyline to the well done voice overs, the intuitive dating system and much more stuff to do! I love how players can craft their own costumes :) Only issue I currently have is the stamina. It takes quite awhile to regenerate, I wish to play longer :( Edit: Currently stuck, can't continue the story due to level & power. Need to afk grind",
            "The ads showed that in this game you can choose. So for example, pretend your goal is becoming the emperor. You pick choices to become that. But in the ACTUAL game it does not give me many choices. It makes me battle other competition more instead of choosing. What encouraged me to play the game were the ads and it looked REALLY fun. But it is very different, please change the ads to how it really looks or change the game to the same as the ads.",
            "The gameplay is unique, and i love the costumes so much. Very addictive!!! Update: After stopping to play after 1 year and coming back, I can say that this game is still very addictive and fun. Alot changed but it's still awesome. My previous character is gone though but it doesn't matter to me. I hope you improve the message/chat system because some messages or chat history automatically disappear. I hope you fix that issue.",
            "Not bad of an app, but the whole couple thing that pops up gain and again and again for people together in the game no matter what you're doing, needs to just stop. It is really, I mean HIGHLY annoying whenever it pops up over and over, messing up whatever I'm doing by blocking my view. It's not cute, just in the way. Find another way to showcase players being coupled up for a year or however long. I would rather see what I am doing, not getting blocked by stuff we don't really need"

If I try to read other stories then there is no problem but with this story only consume my time as it took more than 30 minutes but still it never download the content.",

But man I love this app because it's hard to find interactive stories that are LGBTQ friendly or in my case Lesbian friendly. Thank you for this. 5 stars, although I do wish that you made the stories be more friendly to your choices because I feel like your choices don't matter in here almost at all, but needless to say they are very touching :)"

Its previous researchers who may have added the mess by mistake. The staff are always very polite. And they can only do so much. Connect the dots before you add them to the permanent files. Save yourself from frustration.",
            "I cancelled my free trial because it wouldn't let me look up anything without saying I needed to upgrade and Suprise after my free trial although I cancelled my free trial I was still charged 129.00. So I tried once more to add a person to my family tree that they had recommended and it still tells me to upgrade so what the hell is the 129.00 for ? Now I am in a dispute to get my money back that should never had been taken. They suck and I actually rate them negative 10 stars !",
            "The site makes it hard to cancel the free description. They make u go thru 4-5 pages & u have to fill out your information & number & keep asking over & over for extra confirmation to cancel the free trial. That's so aggravating. Also, the site didn't show my family in Costa Rica, seems like it only can search in the United States.",

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

Is not worth it $11/months for premium. I don't know where i need to tell this. If I'm not wrong crunchyroll promise in 2014, they want to make all anime available in my country. In reality, until now maybe less than 10% anime available in my country compare to U.S crunchyroll",
            "Amazing app, there's loads of anime to choose from. But there's WAY too many adverts. I feel like I only get to watch half of the episode, because the rest is advertising different series.",
            "I love the app and the selection, but I think the app would benefit from a request board of some sort where people can go once a week or something like that to request a new anime they want to watch, instead of contacting you through social media or the help center. Other than this feature I do love the selection and the app and I hope you all are doing well.",
            "The app was never that functional to begin with, but recently became completely unusable. I have high speed internet, but I can't watch a single episode without buffering every 15 sec and being automatically switched to low quality. Rest of my streaming apps are fine. Casting to Chromecast was bad to begin with: it would disconnect regularly or refuse to sync, but now the video quality makes it impossible to watch on a larger screen. A video streaming service that can't stream video. Incredible.",
            "This app is really good never really had a problem with it till now, everytime I tried to watch something it always says that it can't connect to crunchyroll. My internet is high speed it has nothing to do with it, i've tried resetting everything from my phone to reinstalling the app but it always says that. I really hope I can get some help to fix this problem."

            "Good game. I noticed that I had horrible memories of other Five-BN games because of their back and forth action. In this, you can go all the way from the end to the start but most items are regional, which is a good improvement. Other than that: no \"energy\" system. Only bad thing was that you couldn't use other items for things that could clearly be done with another item.",
            "The gameplay seemed to have been designed by creating a puzzle and just randomly scattering the required pieces. I don't agree with the reviews mentioning the gameplay is relatively self-contained in each area. I seem to recall going in and out of the dark territory (lever for the chest in the dome city and the bracelet from the fox after obtaining a rubber glove). The puzzle that really annoyed me was the pattern in the desert which anyone can memorize at a glance requiring a charcoal print.",
            "Really happy with this game loving the story and happy that puzzles ect aren't a as repetitive as you in earlier games, still would just like more hidden Object scenes and when the people are talking their mouths are a bit off putting, but I can just not look I suppose. Overall though progressing with the game creation really well and I'm enjoying playing.",
            "I finally found one of these games that doesn't overwhelm me by having to go back several spots trying to remember where a new found object goes. I like the way it stops you from going back until you have a needed object (if you can't go back don't fret, you will be able to when needed). I may finally be able to find all of the collections and morphs to play the bonus games. Hopefully there will be some kind of warning that you're about to finish the game to get all the bonus objects.",
            "Well I have played all of the Darkness and Flame as well as all of the Lands of the lost. Absolutely wonderful. Great story lines and game play is easy. Puzzles are challenging but not so hard that you can't figure them out. I do wish the endings were a little more dramatic lolol. Will be waiting for number 4. Hope to see it soon. Until then I'm going to play the Legacy games. Thanks for some good entertainment."

The app should run smoother than ever. <br><br>Plus... we added a sleep timer feature for premium users!

            "Best. App. EVER!! Its amazing! Sure you cant download as many songs as you want, but they are just making buisness! Furthermore, its just great and I am listining to it as I am writing this. I can't think of a better app, spotify is way too expensive as I am a kid. But this here is just an amazing legend. It gets my 5 stars. (It deserves infinite stars though)",
            "I really hate the fact that you know have to upgrade to premium to download as much songs as you want, it really sucks, I've had this app since 2017 when you didn't have to be premium, kinda sucks now you have a limited amount of songs you can download. Also adds are getting worse and worse, need to fix that",
            "audiomack is usually a 5star App ...However, this new upgrade which only allows you to download a certain amount of premiums downloads before forcing an upgrade .... which once was free causing my rating to be as is... i am a long time customer and once im able to download an unlimited amount of download w\\o seeing certain songs being characterized as premiums my rating will increase significantly!!!!!",
            "If I'm being honest. Don't understand the complaints. The app devs need the money that they get for premium, limiting the offline Playlist to 20 isn't bad because you can still have an online one. You just need internet to play the songs and most people have data so I don't see the big deal. The app is good, you find new artist, remix and really anything you want. The staff is monitoring the app constantly from what I've seen and overall just works as a good music streaming app.",
            "First. Anybody on this app that is looking for a Apple music replacement is lame; thats why excluscivity has a fee. Second, if you use Live Mixtapes but are tired of the lack of currensy, this is the type of release access you need. Finally, I use more Audiomack than the LiveMixtapes App, the Apple Music app, because apple is...corporate. Eventually they'll pick it up but Audiomack to me is still getting the links to the streets. Like that Zayetoven release, i cant find it anywhere. Thank you."

        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

I think there are no other hookup apps that allow new users to communicate freely, except for the cougar hookup app. You have to know how important it is to have a feature that helps new and old users communicate freely, so there is no doubt 10/ 10 recommendations!! I like this popular dating app that serves mature old women. Of course, it is actually a good thing that mature women???s dating needs are being valued again. Get a opportunity to try.",
            "Hookup apps which my favorite now! When I just registered into the cougar hookup app, I felt that its operation is very simple and the function settings are also perfect. Yesterday, it helped me quickly match my current sugar baby, a young gaper, and adult friend finders. I like him very much because he is very charming. I have recommended the cougar hookup app to my friends. This is one of the best tinder hookup apps I have tried for seeking arrangement and sugar love. Old woman love it best.",
            "For me, this is a very cool milf dating app. I like to chat with all kinds of strangers from all over the world, so how to quickly find these strangers nearby is a problem that needs to be solved. The great thing is that I use the Local Flirt and Moments function to help me get fast and accurate user matching. The great thing is that after enjoying the features I like, the active adults and singles here responded quickly to my message. This is something that surprises me because it is difficult.",
            "Mature dating for older women and silver singles, what a novel concept and direction of hookup apps. Most users now have a positive attitude towards older women dating ,which is completely different from a few years ago. I am very happy to see this concept because the dating needs of older women and silver singles have been ignored for too long, Cougar life is wonderful and similar to study cougar hookup apps, the users on cougarD are very active, especially young gapers and adult friend finder.",
            "I often spend a lot of time and energy to screen some local older women and sugar women to hookup dating on other hookup apps. But after I use the cougar dating app, I can quickly find the local older women to say hi through the filter page."

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

It is more than just an international dating and hookup app for sugar daddy and sugar baby, but more of a way of lifestyle for the millionaire match with the beauties.

We are so ready to help you find that person. How about you?",

            "Undoubtedly, it is not the best of its kind, compares to seeking arrangement web version, but it suits me the best, and it is super easy to find new people around me, theres no bots, no ads etc. The best of all, if you go to a business trip, you can still find people there. Its a secret arrangement and no one will know anything about it.",
            "I paid for a monthly service 14.99 THEN bought 9.99 of coins. I did these things to unlock. Meanwhile I cant even send messages again when I could before. Cant put myself on the top of list when it says indont have coins. But I do. I bought them REFUND PLZ. I SPENT all that money and am still getting what ppl get that dont buy anything. It's like you guys are just acting like I didnt purchase. My purchases are not even showing up or allowing me to do the things it said it would. ReFunD Plz.",
            "one of reasons I rate this hookup app full stars is It allows you to initiate instant contact after signing up, and the connections are almost free of charge. I totally understand that you need money to keep your company work. So I paid the service. As a paid user, I am quite satisfied with your service and as a sugar baby, I found what I am here for and that;s enoug for me.",
            "Money making scam. Charges for messages and real interaction. Basic 'like' and match feature is available for free...but is pointless. After signing up and committing money to chase better result, I was utterly disappointed, no more confident in the users, appear to be just scams or robots and complete waste of time. Would be zero stars if possible.",
            "Loved it! Had some real nice hookup with several sugar baby found here. They would recommend you pretty sugar baby from all over the world, because for most sugar daddy, distance is really not an issue. I love travel and I would be willing to travel a far distance if I like someone. Besides, with long distance, it would guarantee a secret arrangement. So personally, I prefer to go to hookup with a sugar baby far away. It gives me a sense of security like a holiday."

It features several mini-games that toddlers and pre-K kids will love to play, and the more they do the better their math skills will become!

They'll have a great time completing games and earning stickers, and you‘ll have a great time watching them grow and learn.\r\n\r\nMath Kids features a number of puzzles that teach while your child plays, including:\r\n• Counting - Learn to count objects in this simple game of addition.\r\n• Compare - Children can build their counting and comparing skills to see which group of items is bigger or smaller.\r\n• Adding Puzzle - A fun mini-game where kids create math problems by dragging numbers on the screen.\r\n• Adding Fun - Count the objects and tap on the missing number.\r\n• Adding Quiz - Put your child's math and addition skills to the test.\r\n• Subtracting Puzzle - Fill in the missing symbols in the math problem.\r\n• Subtracting Fun - Count the items to solve the puzzle!\r\n• Subtracting Quiz - See how much your child has improved in their mathematics skills for subtraction.\r\n\r\nWhen kids can play while they're learning, they're much more likely to recall information. It also makes them want to learn more frequently, which will give them a huge boost when they start kindergarten.\r\n\r\nMath Kids also comes with a number of features that help adults monitor and manage their child's progress. Customize game modes to increase or decrease the difficulty, or check report cards to see scores for previous rounds.\r\n\r\nMath Kids is the perfect introduction to the basics of counting, addition, and subtraction. It will teach your toddler, kindergartener, 1st grader sorting, and logical skills along with early mathematics, giving them the perfect foundation for a lifetime of learning.\r\n\r\nNote to Parents:\r\nWhen creating Math Kids, we focused on building the best possible learning experience for children of all ages.

            "love the app and my daughters (7 and 5 years old) love it as well. My oldest greatly improved her math skills and quite rapidly. Also available in French (we are francophones). They love to collect stickers and stamps, and I can print certificates and activity sheets for them. Just amazing!!!",
            "This is a great app with visually appealing graphics, making it kid-friendly and fun. One suggestion would be to add more number range levels. The current levels allow for 0-5, 0-10 and 0-20, while it would be good to add ranges 5-10, 5-15, 10-15 and 15-20 as well. That way, more advanced learners could practice their skills in the higher number ranges. Furthermore, the app is fantastic. Well done! :-)",
            "My granson (who is 4 year old )loves playing this math learning game. It's great for preschoolers. It is simple, effective, and encouraging as the child learns. Above all it is fun learning numbers and math with this app. I love there are NO ADS to interrupt and distract the child while they're learning. Thank you for developing this free learning app for children.👍😃",
            "This is a very lovely app, and because of this app i helped my littke brother ALOT in math i am so happy our mother found this app(i also play it myself with my little brother🤭) Really amazing app people should make more apps like this. And there is no adds and it is completely free! Thank u for making this wonderful app🤩💝👍",
            "I find that because there is no sense of getting it right or wrong, they just try all the answers until one is correct. There is also no sense of progress before getting a sticker etc. The end result is that there is no game element and they get bored within 20 questions."

Its anoying because you need to have coins in order to unlock each chapter. I pay to become vip but i was only able to read 3 chapter of the book that i pay $25.its unsane why paying for something that you are not allowed to finish. Fot the app if the book is not finished just do us all a favor and dont make it available for readers.",
            "The stories are great but when you're in the middle of the story it's blocked because you gotta buy coins or a membership and then some books are not complete i wayed to finish reading a book but i have to wait for them to post new chaptese so whats the point of getting the VIP membership if can't finish the book because is not complete",

But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\r\n\r\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\r\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\r\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\r\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again. \r\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\r\n\r\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\r\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings.

In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos.The \"Preschool\" Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration.

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "It would be a great app... if it wasn't so petty, everything seems so strict, and they're quick to hand out bans for practically no reason it seems, and you forced to pretty much be a drama queen 24/7 or else everything gets deleted and/or u get banned, but if your too dramatic you also get everything taken down and or banned, and seeing as how the app is run by random non dev people, if they dont like you or a friend of theirs doesn't like you or anything, ban its it's stupid I'm offended by it",

            "Overall,the app is awesome for The bisexual community,but the app keeps crashing down,kindly rectify it as soon as possible,but Hindi is not supported and thats disgusting and gross....",
            "I like this app it's really nice but there's one thing I do not like about it you guys really should check their birthdays and the people's ages on here they're really young girls on here that our lives about 14 to 15 years and I thought this page was more for adults 18 and upI really don't want to get in trouble or go to jail for talking to a minor you guys are really should look into this I do like the app except for the little girls on",
            "I love the app. I has a lot of potential for growth. The UI does need a few tweaks. But kudos for making everything easily accessible. Curators on the app do abuse their power. I hope Amino looks into this. It is a really great app. 5 stars if they can fix these issues."

            "I like this app. A lot of good tracks and albums can be downloaded into the app and listened to offline. That's if you are subscribed to Amazon prime which is only $7 a month. I like that in the app there is an eq for different genres + a custom setting where I can adjust the bands on the EQ for best enjoyment of the music . Easy to navigate and user friendly app. For a lot of tracks, the lyrics are shown if you want.",
            "Try to stream a song, says it can't find on SD card?! Why would it be on the SD card if streaming online (5g connection mind you)? Ok, so I'll download it, wait, nope, won't make any progress. Just updated a few days ago, fixed nothing yet had the nerve to ask me to sign up for the monthly service?! Seriously, let me play the music I own properly and I might consider that in the future. In the mean time, get this sorted out please.",
            "What music? I can hardly play anything that I have in my music anymore, out of several thousand songs. The only thing that doesn't get auto-skipped are songs that I've got offline or the occasional song that HASN'T been made unavailable for some unknown reason. This has been an issue for months now, with no solution. As with other users, I have also had issues with the app crashing, upon attempted login or while listening to songs. Might as well use YouTube Music at this point.",
            "So unimpressed with this app, constant glitches, crashing. Try and use it to listen to a podcast while I walk the dog and it can't even manage a few sentences before it has crashed and I have to get my phone back out to touch it to start playing again. I have a very new modern phone if it doesn't work on this how would be it on an old phone with less power.",
            "Update: got update and still no \"play next\" option so i took away a star. The U.I. is garbage. A \"play next\" option after shuffling is a must. I hate having to go back and searching artists to find a song just to have that option. Also, being able to arrange songs more than a few spots at a time is a must. I've had songs cut out for several seconds at a time. Very annoying."

I thought this was a chatting/friendship/dating app based off of youtube ads. False advertising and lazy design. Uninstalling. Don't download",
            "This app is great the reason why I only give it 4 stars is because of the fact that it is easy for younger people to get through and I have had it happen to me so many times that I have had to kick and report a child just for being on the app in my stream. It's never fun but rules are rules. Also it's a little annoying how every time you use a image from your gallery for a background it makes a copy of it I have like 10 of the same image now because of that.",
            "I actually really enjoy this app but the problem is I noticed the more popular people that do live calls struggle to get on the phone with everyone because of the one person on the phone at a time thing. I think it'd be wayyyy better if you put it where mutiple people can talk on the phone like maybe 5 at once or something because if not then it gets kind of annoying and frustrating with everybody wanting to talk on the phone at once.",
            "I first got this app back when its logo was yellow and before it updated (Idk what version that was). I got rid of it to clear some space for an Azur Lane update. Now that I'm coming back to it, I'm happy to see it hasn't changed much. Thanks for this app, I may not get many viewers when I practice my piano, but I still love preforming for people. Have a great day <3",
            "By far the best live audio app I've ever downloaded. The people on this app are amazing and you're guaranteed to find an amazing community to become a part of. As a streamer myself I can only say good things about spoon for the fact that they actually listen to suggestions and do their absolute best to make sure you have a good time using the app. Spoon streamer - 👁️⃤Gildanman🏆"

DO NOT INSTALL. if you don't believe me and other people experience it yourself.",
            "Sooo many fake accounts(robots)(Bots)(AI)(Artificial Intelligence). Too many people using the same exact message. Nobody says anything real. For what it's worth the app feels nice and the programmer should be proud of their own craftsmanship.",
            "Its a good app just needs to improve more and they should think of some advantages for the senders as the senders invest huge amounts in the app",
            "Do not download. The layout is confusing, invasive, and refuses to respond through their customer service email when they have no option to permanently delete unless you want to link Facebook, google, and your phone number. I didn't read the reviews and tried on a whim. Seriously, don't install it. If there were such a thing as negative stars or turds, this app deserve the lot of those. Has anyone successfully deleted their account from there?",
            "Tiktok is BY FAR better. I spent 4 hours trying to figure out this app, and customer service did NOT help. The app DOES have potential, but the problem right now is, there needs to be an entire rescripting of the English version of this app. User guidelines are vague and not well written. FAQ does not hold enough information. The 24-7 customer service bot is all AI and there is no actual person, unless they give you an email.. which I am still waiting for.. App is fun, but still needs work."

            "I love this app for the most part, but it does have room for some what I believe would be easy add ons and changes. One of the bigger changes I’d like to see happen is age preferences. Even for just becoming friends with other people I don’t want them to be super younger then me so it’d be nice to be able to choose. Another change would be better monitoring of the pictures people put on. I’m done seeing nearly naked boys. Anyways I hope y’all read your reviews cause these would be nice changes!",
            "SMS verification is not working at all for me. I’ve tried various phone numbers, creating a new account and messaging support all to no avail. This is only an issue with this app. Please create a big ticket for this. *Update* sent an email to support asking for a bit of cache clearing for my phone number and next thing you know it worked! No I can go back to searching for my poly princess! Lol. Thanks OWD. Updated to 5 stars. I would say the “open full profile” flow is a bit unnecessary. The UX for that could be improved a bit. The pics seem cut off at the top and bottom u less that button is tapped. Maybe an “accordion” type of flow would be more effective. Tap the button and the info unfolds to reveal the remainder of the profile. Pics are most important. Great env however for alternative lifestyle dating. Thanks!",
            "I have had this app for around 6 months and it’s really cool to meet people and stuff like that but I’m having this issue where I wanted to change my pictures and when I tried to click on the picture I wanted it didn’t do anything so I clicked on the same picture like 30 times and still didn’t do anything so basically I can’t change my pictures. HELP",
            "The app and website are great for combating boredom! I play pets on my computer but haven't been able to play on my phone fora chat with people through direct message iWatch peoples livestreams but haven't done any licensed in myself get enjoying meeting people from my area in person at local restaurant but have had to put a hold on that until such time as the pendant is over",
            "The app is incredible, I meet new people everyday and have immense conversations with multiple people. But the problem is, I’m always seeing these “snapchats” that advertise child pornography and then adults selling there pornography to anyone whether they are older are younger than 18. I’ve reported multiple accounts and it just seems like more and more show up. Take control of your app."

            "It's alright, I like the many different options you have for describing yourself and the unique parts of the app that make it like a mixture of social media and a dating site. HOWEVER, it's a tad complicated, every time I go onto the app it bugs me about getting a paid membership, and without a paid membership I can't even put my distance preference for dates, cause tbh I don't want to match with someone in the USA when there are people in my area that I can match with (which it won't show me)",
            "I enjoyed the app, even paid for the sub for a couple weeks but when I didn't want to use the service anymore I cancelled the payment. It still bought it again on its own. I didn't wish to use the app anymore but still took money from my account to pay for a subscription that I had already cancelled. I cancelled it on play store. I did not uninstalled the app, heck I still have it downloaded. But i cancelled that subscription. I could say the app has some issues, but overall it's good.",
            "So painfully slow on upload its rediculous. Videos often show without audio. Videos record and dont upload AT ALL. Loads of guys hunting for money. Exhorbitant pricing . Overall a failure of promises. Extremely biased to US and Asian Markets. So many guys into extreeme kinks which you cannot filter out. All you can do is endlessly block to wade through some quite nasty people. Forced to pay to chat with local guys is ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING!",
            "So I was having a nice conversation with someone and all of a sudden -poof- both the conversation and the \"match\" vanished into thin air. Then I went through the digest to try to find the person I was speaking to and I posted this: \"How come profiles and conversations randomly disappear? Like the app is trying to force you to buy a membership 🤔\" . Then I get a message that my post was \"remoderated\" and removed. You better have a good explanation for this.",
            "App seems good, but it keeps saying I am in a wrong place, therefore I can't use it. Support told me a few ways to fix the issue and then tried to fix it themselves, but it still didn't work. Also I don't think they know that asexuals have sex too since they don't let you pick both \"asexual\" and your preferences for topping or bottoming"

Whenever I choose a specific song on my playlist it doesnt play it and ends up playing a different song on my playlist. I updated it and everything, and it still hasnt been fixed. I have no idea if it is a bug, but it needs to be fixed asap.",
            "I've had continuous problems with pandora since I got it. I download songs and playlists, then when I try to play them, it says I haven't downloaded them. It never wants to open unless it has an internet connection, even though all I ever listen to is my playlists in offline mode unless I am actively searching for new music. And now today, with no warning or reason WHATSOEVER, it has erased ALL my music and playlists!!!!! My advice is don't waste your money.",
            "I use it just about every day. The app will automatically close if I pause a song for 1 min to do something on my phone. The app will close and I have to restart it and the playlist. super annoying. I've un-installed and re-installed it, and that helped the crashes that everyone, including myself, used to have. It didn't help the pause and automatically closing issues...I've checked my phone settings on my old Samsung10 5g and they're cool...it is the app that is the issue.",
            "I've been a Pandora subscriber for several years now. I love no ads. Since Last update, Pandora just stops working and closes. I thought it was my phone. Then I changed phones, for other reasons. Still plays for about 15 minutes before having to reopen the app. I hope that bug can be fixed. I have to see all that work fine tuning my stations be all for naught.",
            "Used to work great but now it will shuffle through all songs without playing them , the songs will pop up then the next one will pop up while no music is heard or can be played. I've uninstalled multiple times and can't figure out the issue. I want my refund back because I can't use the app or listen to the song I want"

            "Great game, its a good way to pass the time. Bit difficult to grasp what to do in the beginning but once you get the hang of it then its great fun. 30/10/2020 Um.... what happened guys? This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "This game was good and creative tho. But sorry to say, it's quite troublesome (and a bit boring) to unlock next level unless you're born with high patient attitude. It takes me forever to unlock next level. (If you get one wrong then your life bar decreased more than 20% but you need to answer like 10 questions correct to kill only 20% of that monster's life bar 🙂 i hate this \"inequity\").",
            "Easy, fun, and educational. Little repiticious but I am only a few quests in. Fighter is nice but different units can also be chosen and upgraded. Continuing the adventure to see where it leads It has been several month in and the game is still really great to play.",
            "I love this concept! It makes learning Japanese fun. But it would be nice if you could add a way to switch from Japanese-English to English-Japanese too. Or if you could mix it up like that. It would also be nice if you could actually show me how much attack power each knight has. I upgrade my knights, so I've got 'low level' knights with more attack power than the 'high level' knights. I would like to be able to see this difference on their stats page. And add more words/vocab.",
            "Great App! You can enjoy learning Japanese while taking a journey to a RPG game. I would advise a change on the repetition of one on the same dungeon, I passed some understanding only 3 words. As the character have almost no impact on the level, I would appreciate more classes to play. From learning perspective, I really recommend this app, it really really helps to feel rewarded from learning",
            "This app is good, it helps me get familiarized with Katakana (I already know Hiragana when I started playing this). There are also words you can learn here, so it's great. One thing though, it would be nice if you could add another level of dungeon which consists of Kanji that are commonly used by Japanese. That is all, thank you!!"

Definitely wouldn't spend money on it like that.",

All my matches, conversations, media and settings were lost after a website update - I was unable to continue with my connections - no reaction from support. And that was a paid \"gold\" account! Complete waste of money, time and energy.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Dudes swipe right, in order to match but don't talk. It makes no sense. If you're interested in someone and match them, why be unresponsive? It is very immature and wastes everyone's time. Therefore I am giving a low rating. There's great potential, but people need to stop being immature and actually talk to their matches.",
            "Installed the app and cannot log on either with Facebook, phone or email. Constant errors keep popping up when trying to log into an existing account. Edit October 2020. Since found out I have been banned from Tinder. When I spoke to them, they will not tell me why I have been banned and they didn't do appeals. How can you ban someone and not tell them why or to even get their side of the story!!!",

I downloaded it again last night and it won't open and keeps saying \"we're experiencing some issues\". Who's messed around with it? I mean there's no actual chance of meeting anyone on there, but it was perfectly fine and straightforward before."

It automatically shows you both, which makes it even more difficult to find anyone who interests you. Download this app at your own risk, because it's absolutely preposterous.",

Highly disappointed and would not suggest. Location settings suck as well, and you can't even change who you wanna view. If I said I like women why do I see a line of men.

Hope this is figured out soon, cause now my streaks are gone 😒 Uhh I reinstalled the app cause I needed to make room for something else at the moment, and I'm trying to get it back on my phone, and it's telling me my device is not supported??? (This was all on the same day btw). It's not like I even had a choice in whether or not to update my phone cause nothing would work without the update.",
            "I've been using this app for about 3 or 4 years now and I've never had any problems until now. I renewed my Amino+ membership and it wouldn't update or let me open the shop. I tried restarting my phone a couple times and then decided to uninstall and reinstall. After reinstalling and trying to login it said that my device is not supported. I own a Google Pixel 3a. What is happening?? edit: Nothing has happened in terms of fixing this problem.",
            "\"Update: bug fixes\" Yeah I dealt with bug fixes the entire month. It would not save my minutes online at all, and my messages would sometimes take a minute or two to load and send. It got to the point where I uninstalled then reinstalled and now I'm here typing this. For some reason, amino seems to no longer support google Pixels, seeing how another pixel user had this problem. This isn't the devices problem, it's amino. Please try and fix this issue.",
            "I love this app, but recently it won't let me log in which sucks because I never got the chance to pay an artist I was commissioning. It says to update the app or that my device (a Google pixel 3a) doesn't support it. Ive updated my phone to the latest version so I really do think the app is the problem not my phone. Edit (10/31/20): nothing has happened to fix this problem. Please PLEASE! FIX IT!",
            "Everytime I try to put a YouTube video on my post, or when I do a live video screening, the link is always saying that it's \"invalid.\" I've been having this problem for months and when I try getting in contact with customer service, they just send me a link to an help center which doesn't help in the slightest!

Still not allowing me in! Have emailed the one given on this page and no response.",

Update: I keep getting red flagged and keep getting asked to verify over and over again even though I had several times. This is so stupid. Update again: they won't let me come back in! Saying I need to change passwords but they won't let me! Horrible site. I'm deleting forever and telling others to never use this site.",

I have already proved I'm one hundred percent real but this time I am trying to verify no matter what I do it's not letting me. I don't want to lose my account because I have many people I talk with. Ridiculous. The biometric is stupid and should be updated.",

I've been asked to verify twice in one week. The most recent time I was verified by picture then it asked me to change my password. Problem is I signed up with Facebook and therefore do not use a password to log in. I emailed a few times trying to resolve this issue and still am locked out.",

Randomly opens these video feeds in the corner of the screen, not sure if they're some kind of ad or someone's live stream since there's no explanation for them, but not fond of them randomly opening like that if they are live feeds, especially if it is opening up my camera and mic when it does it, but again, there's no explanation, so I've just been closing them."

I just joined today, and what a horrible experience I'm having.",

Pictures that follow the rules randomly disappear, it gives an error when trying to upload new ones, and sometimes the app simply doesn't even load. It's nothing to do with devices or connections on my end, so I know it's this app. Great idea, but execution leaves much to be desired.",

I dont super care really, but i imagine theres people out there that will be more irritated about getting C blocked by a dating app than me. Lol.",
            "Whatever cool thing mutual thought it was doing by forcing me to crop all my photos when I upload them needs to understand that I want to upload my photos at their original size as much of the picture involves more than just the person in it. Also 95% of the women I match with don't message me back when I message them. This dating app is becoming a rejection app and doing terrible for my already low self esteem."

            "Some upsides, some very big downsides. Upsides: you can chat with people from loads of countries around the world & closer to home, too. People doing live streams look generally nice. Big downsides: Diamonds which you need to send digital \"gifts\" to the broadcaster are expensive, e.g. 450 for $10 but gifts vary from 1 diamond to 9999. Another big downside is there are several scammers with fake profiles now. When they latch on, you'll just want to leave. Basically, \"a license to print graphics\".",

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "I'm surprised the app rated as highly as it did. It's useless for me. The pages jump around at random. Sometimes only a white screen shows. The table of contents never displays. The slider at the bottom doesn't work. There are many other problems as well. Books are encrypted and cannot be ported to a more usable format. Do not buy books through mymustreads.",
            "Awful. Thus dies my hope to support local bookstores; this app is absolutely useless except on my PC, destroying the portability of an e-book. I will read my current purchases on my PC and then abandon this platform. Not only does it take hours for a book to download vs. mere seconds to the kindle app, the functionality is also abysmal. Such a shame. I hate having to use Amazon as my go-to, but with competition this feeble, it's no wonder they have cornered the market. Edit: Not giving any more stars to this review: I tried shutting down and restarting, deleting and reinstalling the app on two different tablets, and letting the install run for a couple of hours with little progress. Finally, I left one tablet attempting to download for a full 24 hours. At the time I posted this review, I would have given negative stars if that were possible. However. I was given a full refund on the two books. Doesn't mean I'm going to try my luck with another purchase, but at least the customer service is responsive.",
            "I use a lot of different e-reading apps, and this is the worst. If you are looking to support indie bookstores, my local bookstore uses Kobo. My biggest complaint about this app is when I open it and it doesn't load properly, but does load a glaring white screen.",
            "It's pretty stable but I'm disappointed that it offers no highlighting capabilities just bookmarking.",
            "I'd give less than one star if possible. This is unusable. Even though I've downloaded all chapters to my phone - to start one or skip to others can take 3-5 minutes. It also randomly stops for no reason, and when I try tobstart it again, yes, it takes minutes to start and it's lost where it was. There are pieces of audio missing from the end of chapters entirely. In short, this should not have been released and is unusable."

            "I have two contradictory things to say. First, this game is the best with wonderful 3D graphics, it could be more better with other animations as others specified. Secondly, this game is so damn ADDICTIVE !!!!! It is another type of the social platform where you get to meet different people and talk to them. What I want to say is that this game is seriously not for teenage students, as they are the easy targets of addiction. So, I would request to increase the age limit to 18 years or adults.",
            "The game doesn't improve, the only thing that improves are the item prizes but for the satisfaction of the players nothing is done. Developers should focus on game optimization, faster loading screen, smoother game experience, and events to keep your players hyped (not same event that happens every year). But i don't think they ever listen to their players suggestions or complaints. Could've been a better game.",
            "What happened to the daily rewards?! U used to love the game but now it is ridiculous! The price for animations are stupidly expensive, and don't even get me started on clothes! Since there is no more daily rewards it is so hard to get coins! Also we should be able to jump and stuff like that, and be able to do poses on beds and chairs. But PLEASE add more daily rewards and make things less EXPENSIVE!!! (SO not voting for game of the year)",
            "First of all, I love this game BUT sadly, I agree with the other reviews on here that this game would much more enjoyable if all items were cheaper/affordable and there was more ways to earn coins. Wouldn't this game be so much more fun if it were like the Sims where you could get a job and earn money and get job promotion too!? I think so. Secondly, Please allow us to sell items, return or trade with others. I'm stuck with items i no longer want therefore want to clear out.Please make changes!",
            "Mostly just fashion which is fine but, I really want to play soccer. Having a bionic goalkeeper outfit is great, but I want to be able to use it. Please add a penalty kick game or a 5 on 5 game so the soccer outfits are of use. Of course i would choose to play goalkeeper. Tournaments would be even better. That would make this 5 star."

App does not deliever on what is the promised goals points noted after using for an month, A) not the proper choice of gender SELECTED. Had selected females I get guys contacting me. B) too many bots in the free ONCE YOU PAID THE PEOPLE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEAR AND YOU ARE STUCK WITH AN DEAD APP. C) Disgusting app that neither shows who online and close to your location GENDER SEL. BEWARE OF THE APP PROMISES BIG AND FALLS FAR FAR SHORT.",
            "Terrible money hungry app, that might not even have any actual females on it. The week I spent giving it a try, not a single real conversation came from it just a lot of notifications that turn out to be bots. You cannot do a single thing in this app without a pop-up to upgrade to VIP, and at least 1 ad popping up. I mean that literally, even bringing up the settings to delete my profile before I uninstalled the app was slowed down and hindered because I had to wait for an ad to finish.",
            "RUN AWAY! Don't believe the reviews, they are probably from bots, as are most \"users\" in the app. The app is also ridiculously money hungry with invasive video ads after every interaction with the app, not to mention the constant pushing for the VIP membership",
            "I had it for a few days and I didn't see even one real profile... All you're getting is fake profiles sending you some random emoji or hi or a picture which is locked but actually it's their profile picture you can see that without paying.... No point in downloading it",
            "I can't even make an account because it says I need authorization to put a pic up and I can't progress past it and try later."

I personally am not a fan of all the shorts but I understand, that's the way its meant to be, The new app looks great though! Welp, looks like the quick bites didn't work out for ya after all. Like I said full shows and movies probably would have gotten you more subscribers. Never know till you try right. Best of luck in future endeavors!",
            "Needs better shows. I liked The Most Dangerous Game. Die Hart was okay. From there it went downhill. The Fugitive, the Stranger etc seem awefully forced with dialogues written by 12 year olds. Wireless is a mess, you constantly have to turn your phone to not miss anything in the other angle, which is not enjoyable at all. Most of the other shows seem to be special interest, which is not mine. Maybe this is something for teenagers but not for anyone born before 2000.",
            "Love Rachel Hollis... Hate this app. The UI isn't friendly at all. Why pay for an app when you have to watch a beer ad before every episode? And an ad to download an episode I've already watched? I shouldn't have to scroll to find where I left off in a series. Also, if ads are necessary I'd rather not see ads for horror shows I frankly have zero desire to watch and freaks me out when all I'm trying to see is Rachel for some daily inspo.",
            "The app functions fine, but the content is so subpar. I am currently on a free trial, but I will be cancelling. I can't justify paying for another entertainment subscription when it isn't even worth it. It sucks because this did seem like an interesting concept, and there are so many big names associated. Still, I couldn't find one show that I enjoyed enough to pay money to keep watching.",
            "There was literally zero shows or movies that i wanted to watch on here, and the format was really different, im not saying that this app is bad but there isn't a large selection of shows to watch, or at least no interesting and entertaining shows, maybe when you get decent shows and movies, then maybe I'll reinstall it, but now its just a waste of space"

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that 🤭)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! 👍🏻😍😄😁"

App says to change filters, but now can't access the filters! And this is during the 14 day \"free trial\"; cancelled paid membership since pay gives you marginal additional value.",
            "I have just installed and created my profile. The next time I logged in, my account was blocked saying that I violated terms. I haven't even done anything. I tried adjusting my filters, turns out you need to pay a weekly amount. Good thing I haven't paid anything yet. To think that I Googled the 10 best and decent dating apps and it said Lumen was #2 and that it is free. That research was outdated and untrue.",
            "I've used the Lumen app intermittently for sometime and have enjoyed a number of interesting chat's - the only problem is that Covid-19 currently excludes any possibility meeting. However, all will be resolved in due course. We must all continue trying. David (Huddersfield) I'm still in contact with my friend's though Covid-19 denies personal socialisation at this juncture (04-08-20)",
            "I've rated this 1 star deserves no stars... Filters button did not work, back button did not work.... all matches were 85ish miles away as a result of above I assume... stated somewhere you could save matches for later... no button available.... Total waste of time and effort... Brian",
            "Premium service not working. I have emailed support several times, but no response. I paid £49.99 for nothing And the developers answer is to email support!!!??? What a joke."

In the process you will discover the incredible dream that God has for you. \r\n\r\nThe DECISION POINT content is like nothing we have seen before for Confirmation prep. Dynamic Catholic was founded on the idea of “meeting people where they are . . . and leading them to where God is calling them to be!” With this in mind, DECISION POINT covers everything we would traditionally teach in preparing young people for Confirmation, but the program also covers a series of life issues, helping to make a powerful connection between preparing for Confirmation and the candidates’ everyday lives.\r\n\r\nIt is also unique in that it is the first program to be rigorously tested before release. Over and over we have tested the materials in the program to find out what works and refined the content accordingly.\r\n\r\nDECISION POINT is dynamic in every way. One truly unique aspect is that it will not be static. We will be continuously improving our materials year after year based on the feedback we get from participants, DREs, priests, parents, and sponsors. This is a first for any Catholic program. Most programs are developed and then don’t change for seven to ten years. Ours will be improving constantly to better serve today’s young Catholics and the generous volunteers and staff who prepare them for Confirmation. If something isn’t working, we will improve it.\r\n\r\nHere is another first: All DECISION POINT content is available online free of charge, to anyone who wishes to use it.\r\n\r\nWe are honored to serve you and look forward to dynamic collaboration with you, your parish, and the young Catholics you are preparing for Confirmation.\r\n\r\nSend us your feedback at http://dynamiccatholic.com/confirmation/contact/\r\n\r\nVisit DECISION POINT online at: https://dynamiccatholic.com/confirmation/\r\n\r\nFor other great Catholic resources and to learn more visit Dynamic Catholic: http://dynamiccatholic.com/\r\nThe DECISION POINT app was developed with the Subsplash App Platform.",

Over and over we have tested the materials in the program to find out what works and refined the content accordingly.<br><br>DECISION POINT is dynamic in every way. One truly unique aspect is that it will not be static. We will be continuously improving our materials year after year based on the feedback we get from participants, DREs, priests, parents, and sponsors. This is a first for any Catholic program. Most programs are developed and then don’t change for seven to ten years. Ours will be improving constantly to better serve today’s young Catholics and the generous volunteers and staff who prepare them for Confirmation. If something isn’t working, we will improve it.<br><br>Here is another first: All DECISION POINT content is available online free of charge, to anyone who wishes to use it.<br><br>We are honored to serve you and look forward to dynamic collaboration with you, your parish, and the young Catholics you are preparing for Confirmation.<br><br>Send us your feedback at http://dynamiccatholic.com/confirmation/contact/<br><br>Visit DECISION POINT online at: https://dynamiccatholic.com/confirmation/<br><br>For other great Catholic resources and to learn more visit Dynamic Catholic: http://dynamiccatholic.com/<br>The DECISION POINT app was developed with the Subsplash App Platform.",

            "Quick and cool. Nice skill tree system. With some conservative grind, I managed to complete them and finish the game in less than 3 days. Final gears aren't acquired in the late dungeons, *only ridiculous gears. You could go through the game with some cooking knives hidden right in the first castle town.* Yes, I played advanced difficulty.",
            "Hi. So far, I've been enjoying the game. It's a good RPG, not that taxing on mind in regards to grinding. But I have an issue regarding the ads because I can't use them to gain exp boost or shop discounts. And funny thing is, they pop out after I save my gane, which is not where I need them to be. I hope to receive a response as to why things are like this in the game.",
            "Definitely not the best rpg, could use polishing but what can uou expect from a free game? This is a great FREE game were you don't have to watch ads every 30 seconds or so. Ads only show up after saving. Could use more info about stats such as allure bravery and faith, but overall a really solid game. Keep in mind i haven't finished it yet but as far as i've seen, its foundation is solid.",
            "Decent game, but unfortunately I wasn't able to finish it after nearly 20 hours. There's a late game dungeon with lasers blocking the way and after an hour of searching (for a third pass?) I called it quits. The game could also use an in-game guide explaining stats and item effects. I still have no idea what the Allure stat was for.",
            "This is one of the best rpg that i have ever played really. The game is really easy to play and understand its just the missions are really vague so its kinda hard to know what you need to do and the ending is really good dont get me wrong its just i wish there was an ending where we could end up with aulin instead of being with bell i know that there is a ending with auline if you chose to not attack freia ? (I think thats her name) but its not really a romance ending But it is a wonderful game"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I like this app. I really do. But I'm sorry, the watermark thing has to go. It's pointless, for what? Too much ads as well. I cant even download a pic without getting 2 or more ads. I can only download maybe like 5 pictures before my last watermark runs out. These two features are making my experience with this app lower. I understand the ads, advertising, I know. But too much ads. I just don't understand the watermark. Without the Watermark, I would've definitely rated this app 4 stars.",
            "Great app but it could be more useful if users were able to write articles with the app.",
            "Have been a user since 2014.. please stop this watermark thing no one does this it's insane I love this app but that's too much .. listen to your users. Thank you",
            "I have three suggestions: 1. Make your interface look better. It's a really early 2000s look going on and you can do better. 2. When you refresh your discover page it really does nothing but give you the same feed just with 3 or 4 new pictures at the top. I'm pretty sure you're not having a shortage of pictures or something so please improve upon this. 3. The watermark thing has to go. Period. Y'all wildin.",
            "I used to LOVE this app to the point I was a heartist for 3 years in a row, I had deleted it for a while to come back to it being a money pit; want to download so many pictures you have to buy a membership, don't want ads buy the membership, ect. its ridiculous, the app used to be a fun outlet for creativity and now half my pictures are under review and its things like plants and art, I really miss the way it used to be, dont bother getting it anymore unless you want to spend $$ over pictures 😢"

            "Don't install this app, this is just a ludicrous way to waste your money. The app takes your coins whether a call starts or not. It requêtes stupendous amount of coins to call people you're already chatting with, some of the people there feel like bots, it keeps matching you with people that aren't ready to talk while cutting your coins at the same time until it gone. It is so clear that the developers are trying to eat your cash. You've been warned!",
            "Nice and easy app, around 90% is real, at times i have faced fake accts, especially when you select girls only, mostly the first 2 ppl are fake, but Not always. But my main concern like most of the users is price that you have to pay for coins. The price should be reduced by 60-70% so we can use it freely without worrying about cash and in this way the app itself would be able to earn much more, the mangmt of this app should consider this and apply reducd prices for 2 weeks and see the results.",
            "I would give this a 0 star, a this should be shut down rating, they say you can video call for free, no you can't, it costs more to video than anything else in the app, it will cost you 120 coins per minute meaning if me and my bff were video call on this it would cost us £254 for one day, that for all the Americans out there is $300 for 1 hr of video call, change this now or you will have a lawsuit put against you for false advertisement, it is because of this that I can't talk to sum1 I met",
            "Just like every dating app there has to be a free dialogue between users without having to pay atleast 20 free messages. But asking me to pay before any service is pure evil. And Again please where is the log out menu???? It's missing and I need it as soon as possible. Thanks please 😢😢",
            "Hello.. I have a big issue.. please this is seriously a problem for me about the payment option.. about a week ago I recharged of Rs1650.. but I don't get coins after the payment..and today again I recharged of Rs 240 again it's going same.. I need those coins back other wise return the money..I will see how you take the action.. please do this favor.. thank you"

        "description": "Fasting Tracker will guide you to a new lifestyle with healthy habits. You’ll lose weight effectively and feel more active! No diet and no yo-yo effect.\r\n\r\nIS IT EFFECTIVE?\r\nIt’s proven that intermittent fasting leads to fast weight loss. During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body's \"fat-burning\" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nIS IT SAFE?\r\nYes. It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems, such as diabetes.

            "Been using it for a little over a month or so. I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or \"extra features\" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",
            "Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!",
            "This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",
            "I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",
            "I like this app and I appreciate it. Just I have paid $2.99 for ads-removed from the app but the app still shows the ads and ask me to pay again for removing Ads!! I have already sent an email to the developer but I didn't get the response! I'm waiting for your reply as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and support. (UPDATE) I solved this issue by reinstalling the app. Thank you."

            "This is a fun game, and I used to love playing it a lot, but they've decided to become obnoxious with the ads to try to annoy people enough to buy the ad free version. Each game session is two minutes. There is now a \"halftime\" in each one to force you to pause and watch another ad in addition to the ones before and after the game. I understand the need for ads, but as much as I have enjoyed this game, this move isn't making me want to upgrade. It just makes me want to find a different game.",
            "This is a very fun app once you learn how to play it i mean I get 500 usually and sometimes 700 and 800 but my higest score is 950 and trust me it's not easy. one thing I would like to add to the game is a rankboard like who is the best player and who us the second best player. Please community of the game answer me and fulfill my wish. thx for making this fun game",
            "I paid to remove the ads and I'm still dealing with the annoying ads",
            "It's a shame to see what this game has become. I've had it for quite a long time now, but the amount of ads has become ridiculous. They even feel the need to interrupt your two minute game with a half time ad. If you like watching ads, get this game, since that's all there is to do. Devs, you did a good job of screwing things up. Way to go.",
            "The game is simple fun and addictive... one drawback is that after the update, my minion count just keeps growing uselessly as i be teached the maximum level ul in all the powerups... its kindof killing the spirit of the game.. Also when we turn into that humongous minion ball, it tends to get stuck inside buidigs , in corners etc and doesnt move for quite a while. This costs precious game time..."

            "This app seems to be littered with dozens, if not, hundreds of ads that have been up for, in some cases, over 2 years. I sent one a message asking if it was available, and didn't receive a reply. After seeing that the ad was still posted, I also noticed that it was posted 2 years ago. I saw a few other listings that had the same story. I liked how LetGo didn't leave listings over a couple months old without asking the lister if it was still relevant.",
            "This app is far less usable than Letgo was. The second I click on one thing to see what it is, I am immediately bombarded with listings of similar items from ebay. If I wanted to look on ebay, I would use that app. Don't assume I need to see 20 of that item. Prices aren't listed in the browse page so I have to click to find them. And when something sells, it doesn't disappear. It just stays with the other listings and says \"Sold\". I dont need to see all the things I cannot buy.",
            "Over 70% of the messages you will get will be fraudulent scams (they are quite obvious, but it's annoying to deal with). There is not much support for when you have issues with the app and I kept getting my posts removed for items being \"intangible\", which was not true, had photos and descriptions of actual items and there was nothing I could do about it, so it just became pointless and frustrating to use. Stick with FB marketplace or CL or other platforms",
            "Titles, descriptions, and prices of items are not shown in search results, leading me to click a bunch of images only to see that the item is not what I want or out of my price range. PLEASE add titles and prices to search results page. Also the gallery of pictures that are not in any order or in one grid make it confusing to look through listings. I don't get what the intent is... To have me looking through the app forever and never finding what I am looking to buy???? Please fix the UX.",
            "The app already sucked, but now it's worse. Why would you combine 2 apps and not take the good from the other app? To many old listings, nothing expires. Messaging is a joke, you're better off talking to the wall. An speaking of messages, how can I sell something if I dont get notified? To many times I've had to open the app just to see multiple messages, days old, and the buyer long gone, thanks offer up. I remember when this app came out, that was its prime, now it's just garbage."

However, this guy's voice is so beautiful and soothing and he really makes me feel like everything is going to be okay. Even though I find the paid version of this app very expensive, however I do think it's worth it just for the very comforting voice. It's definitely worth the $10.

            "I can switch between my phone and the TV, and it's great. There are recommendations, which I usually like. If you are watching on a phone, you can minimise the screen and have it playing in a small box which you can move around, so you can play games or text at the same time as watching something. It so good, I completely recommend it, get it now! No ads disturb your watching experience either, and I really like that. You can also have multiple accounts for different people.",
            "Netflix has recently started to be a lil buggy The first issues I am having is, As I am watching my show, all of the sudden it just freezes. Second issues is that it once in a while their is a minor lagg. . I think it had started about a week or two ago. But other than that, it perfect. I hope that they fix it ASAP.",
            "This used to work fine on my phone but now for some reason the audio in some movies stops working as the video plays, video stops and audio plays, or even sometimes both audio and video stop. I try skipping ahead and going back to my spot but it rarely fixes the problem, and if it does, its only fixed for a few moments. This has happened in numerous movies ive tried to watch so i try a different movie and the same problem keeps occuring. Its getting on my nerves. Please fix it quickly.",
            "Only thing I wish you guys implement is to add a proper video resolution selection option for both streaming and downloading. Just let us control the resolution that we need. You can definitely add an algorithm to reduce the selected resolution if the network doesn't support it. Apart from that everything is great. Just look at prime video. Their app is so good. This rating will change when a proper resolution selection tool gets implemented.",
            "My only complaint is the subtitle size. I switch between my phone and TV. I like small subs on phone and normal on the TV. It doesn't make sense that I can only change subtitle size through the web and not the app itself. It should be a basic function within the app. It's very annoying that everytime I want to switch devices I have to go through the web, which takes ages to reflect. Take some inspiration from Amazon Prime app. They let you change anything about the subs. Improve please."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "It's a good game. The only issue I have so far is the asinine campaign leveling system. Need to gain levels in order to unlock new stages. I was waiting 2-3 days just to get to 68. Unlock 4-5 more stages and now it's locked until you hit 72. How long will that 3-6 days until I can progress the campaign. Afk arena or mobile legends do not have this issue at all. Go as far as you can until you can't.",
            "Not gonna lie, I finally tried this game after the apologize ad. I've seen this game ads EVERYWHERE, and all of them are either overblown, doesn't have anything to do with the game, or just being fake / false ads in general. In which make me think the game must be so bad, they need to resort to these, never wanted to try it. But after they call themselves out for this, now I wanted to try it. Turned out the game is decent, and the features are rather neat. Hopefully they'd keep the honesty.",
            "This is my straight up favorite game. It's the BEST mobile game. It's not pay to win, and although it definently boosts progress, there are frequent events and chances where you can achieve what you want. IT REQUIRES PATIENCE and strategic planning. When you start the game is boring. Its the truth. When it really becomes fun is once you unlock most of the features at lv.80. It'll take about 2 weeks, but once there its like a whole new game. As long as you do research, and WATCH how to play.",
            "This game is super rigged.... I mean the campaign gives off a very low amount of exp needed when you've reach like level 60 and that you can't advance anymore on the campaign... and so you have to wait for 4 days to reach the required level to advance... so im suggesting that they lower the required level to unlocked the next level in the campaign... and they should also add a reseting option so that the materials you've used to level up the hero will be returned to you so it wont be a waste...",
            "The game is decently fun, I won't say it's not. However, there are many things wrong. First and foremost: the fact that the campaign is level locked. I am lvl 97, and I need lvl 98 in order to play a grand total of 5 campaign levels. That doesn't sound that bad, but when there are like 3 things to do each day while you wait for passive XP to pile up, the game becomes extremely repetitive and boring. I just reinstalled after around an year, and after just 4 days I'm remembering why I uninstalled."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Ads at random time intervals are bad as it is, but if you can't get them to NOT pop up while players are in the middle of a mini game, just leave it. Losing points in a quest etc. because of an unskippable ad is pretty much the definition of annoying. Also the game got more money grabbing every update - no more update gems (instead Spike drops not even half the amount for a while), it's always the same few ponies on sale and everything else costs a fortune...",
            "I really like this game but one day it decide to forget everything i did and now i have to restart. Why cant there be passwords we choose to go with our usernames so we can log back in if it restarts or something like that. I am honestly upset about leaving a three star review but I have to. But other than that the game is great.",
            "I absolutely adore this app! I always watch the my little pony movies, seasons with my sister, and when I recently found out they had a game, I had to check it out. All the characters, their dialogues, is just spectacular. I love that there are many mini games in the game itself! Love the game.",
            "Amazing game!! I never played such a fun game, just one problem . In the events the time given is not enough last time I was just about finish the last round of the event and it finished . I humbly request to do the improvement . After all this is the best game i ever played.",
            "I love the game overall, but there is one minor thing that saddens me. They haven't added even a single new set to the Collections section the whole time I've been playing, and I joined in March. They didn't even make collections for really obvious ones like the Power Ponies."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

            "Worst game to purchase content on, even if you bond it to your FB account, they will erase your purchases even if you've purchased more than $100 worth of skins or weapons, then they will try to make up for it by giving you 14 days of VIP, delete this waste of money...........yes you do, please don't lie, I have talked to someone there and they told me that the game was updated and I didn't agree by a certain date to the update then there was nothing they could do about all my purchases.",
            "The last update is pathetic. Reducing the gold in squad wars is not helping. And it's not fair to give out loyalty points in squad wars. Considering the fact that beyond certain level you need gold for everything.... And pulse rifles are a waste of time. They don't pack a punch even if you hold for maximum power. Holding exposes you to enemy attacks. I think chillingo was doing a great job. I think introducing higher level units and guns that can be purchased by war bucks would be awesome...",
            "Grat app constantly releasing updates and improving, I have been playing for a while and I've met people from other places through the game, support team also helped me with an in game issue that was quickly resolved. Thanks a lot and keep on doing an excellent job.",
            "This game is awesome! I think it just compatible for android phone in recent in Oct 2020. I would give a thumb up for this shooting game as this game accompanied since 3 years ago. Will keep on playing it. Thank you About Fun",
            "The game got an update, I've been playing it for years and it demoted me from level 27 to level 3. I had $500,000 and 400 plus gold, now its all gone.... lame"

As a general comment, I much prefer to pay up front rather than buy coins (hints) during the game. This is why I am not so keen on other games - take, take, take and you never get to the end of the 'story', unless you are a millionaire!",
            "Another great game for this team of developers! The graphics, the storyline, the game play, and the sound makes for such an amazing game! Keep them coming!! I'm always purchasing the full game for it's worth the cost and it comes with a lengthy \"bonus round\"...... FYI, stop leaving low ratings because your phone is NOT compatible for these types of downloads..smh GET A BETTER PHONE OR DOWNLOAD ON YOUR DESKTOP IF AVAILABLE!",

I have uninstalled and installed again with no luck, it is not saving. Please assist or refund my $9.99. UPDATE: I am aware that progress is deleted when reinstalled. the process was deleting before uninstall. process is still deleting after many attempts once reinstalled.

Or maybe you want to know how they operate so you can make sure you and your loved ones don’t become victims? Murder Minute adjusts to your preferences and contains great stories with uncensored photos and videos for anyone with an interest in true crime.\r\n\r\nSome examples of stories (you will get hooked):\r\n\r\nEdmund Kemper\r\nA 6'9\" tall, 250 pound serial killer with an IQ of 145. Edmund Kemper murdered multiple women in the most gory way possible. He has lately been put in the spotlight after being featured in the TV show Mindhunter.\r\n\r\nThe Sacramento Vampire\r\nRichard Chase had an unquenchable thirst for blood. Literally. He believed Nazis were turning his blood into powder and to survive he had to replace it. To do this he made smoothies of blood, guts and gore.\r\n\r\nBTK: Bind, Torture, Kill\r\nDennis Rader was a married, normal seeming man but he murdered numerous women and children over decades and the people around him didn’t have a clue. He took pictures of himself posing with his victims’ corpses, sometimes wearing masks or bondage outfits... super creepy. He thought himself an evil mastermind but was finally arrested after sending clues to the police.\r\n\r\nThe murder of Junko Furuta\r\nThe cruel torture and murder of a Japanese school girl was so monstrous that it is almost unbelievable. Almost as chilling is the fact that all of her torturers were teenagers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bathory\r\nThe Blood Countess is rumored to have bathed in the blood of hundreds of young girls she had brutally tortured and murdered. Is it as legend state; that she bathed in the blood of virgins to maintain her youth, or is she the innocent victim of a conspiracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther famous (or rather infamous) murderers and cases include:\r\n• Ted Bundy\r\n• Broken Arrow\r\n• Charles Manson\r\n• Pedro Lopez (the monster of the Andes)\r\n• YNW Melly\r\n• The Zodiac Killer\r\n• The Golden State Killer\r\n• The KFC Massacre\r\n• The Shankill Butchers\r\n• John Wayne Gacy (the Killer Clown)\r\n• Charles Cullen (the Angel of Death)\r\n• Carmine Galante (a vicious NY mobster)\r\n• Roy Demeo (a mafia hitman who brutally killed his enemies)\r\n• David Berkowitz (the .44 Caliber Killer)\r\n• Mikhail Popkov (the Werewolf)\r\n• Tsutomu Miyazaki (the anime crazed cannibal known as the Otaku Murderer)\r\n• Luis Garavito (the Beast)\r\n• Richard Ramirez (the Night Stalker)\r\n• The kidnapping of Adam Walsh (one of America’s most high profile child abductions)\r\n• Albert Fish (The boogeyman.

I saw a review from a deaf person that said they had no choice but to install. But there is an option. I didn't see it at first. Welp. It's a good app with good stories. What else can I say? I like the dark mode and text format. Ignore my review history. I'd had a long day at work. Oops.",

            "This game is so cute. However, I bought the full version and feel a bit ripped off. The free game has lots of activities so it would lead you to think the paid portion would have just as many. This is not the case. Paid games add on have half the amount of activities and some of the same activities in each game. I'm disappointed really. I hardly ever pay for games and I wish I didn't with this one. Not worth 4 dollars.",
            "Cute graphics. No annoying ads. Not much here, though. It's a good start. Needs much more content. Music WAY too repetitive. Didn't try add-ons yet. At 3.99 each, they would need to have far more game play than this free one. We finished all the option in less than 10 minutes.",
            "Begrudgingly i have purchasedthe full version 3 times. It is cute and my kid loves it. He first played it at age 2 and at age 5 still plays it.",
            "I purchased the game a while ago, eventually deleted it from my phone, now my child wants it back BUT I get an error message when I try to restore my purchase. I paid money for the extra games and want to be able to use them. What is going wrong?",
            "It's fun for my 3 and 6 year old kids. I wish it was maybe more educational. Also, after brushing the monster's teeth, the brush sound never stops even when you switch screens, so that's irritating. Hoping that bug will resolve itself, otherwise I may delete the app."

You’ll live life always hoping for that big break that will solve all your money problems.\r\n\r\nYou really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning.\r\n\r\nIf you realize that you’re the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something, and grow wiser.\r\n\r\nRich dad said this point of view over and over, which I call lesson number one: The poor and the middle-class work for money. The rich have money work for them.\r\n\r\nHe understood that every person has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought, and he knew that every individual also had a part of their soul that was resilient and could never be bought.\r\n\r\nSo people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more security.\r\n\r\nThis rich dad poor dad book advocates the importance of financial, financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing, investing in stock markets, trading shares, starting and owning businesses and not relying on loans, as well as increasing one's financial intelligence (financial IQ) to improve one's business and financial aptitude.Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly based on authors life.\r\n\r\nRich Dad Poor Dad has sold over 32 million copies in more than 51 languages across more than 109 countries been on the New York Times bestsellers list for over six years and received positive reviews from some critics.\r\n\r\nHe states that assets generate cash inflow or income, such as stock dividends, rental income from properties, or income from businesses, and the term \"liabilities\" as things that devour cash out of ones pocket, such as one's personal residence, consumer loans, car loans, credit card payments and student loans.

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

This game seems promising I'd totally recommend it to people who would like to learn hangul vocabulary in a fun way. My only concern is when the game starts, I could not fast forward the monologue. It keeps on repeating unless I let it finish on its own.",
            "It's a decent app, but some of the translations are wrong and there are a lot of laughably bad spelling mistakes. Also, once you reach a high level trying to get gems to buy gold is pointless: 300 gems for 150,000 gold is good at first, but once you are around level 100, you'll only be able to level up once.",

        "comments": [
            "I love it, I got scammed a while back in a raffle but other than that it's a really fun game. It's fun to see that it has been updated and kept alive, it does warm my heart! It's not perfect and it has flaws, such as a lot of micro transactions and all. That wouldn't be a problem if the PVE was just as good as the pvp. It would be amazing if the campaign got some love, I get that it's a farming zone for materials. But it would be really exciting to see some more chapters and more pve content.",
            "Really Good Game I really enjoy playing as you can replay characters to gain more coins if you don't want to spend actual money purchasing coins and notes. This is fun to play since it has maturity of the South Park characters like Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters and etc. If you keep struggling you can replay a old level. Enjoy this game since I enjoy watching South Park. Hope to see more things added to this game in the future. Good work.",
            "I've loved this game up until level 12, number 59! It keeps messing up and wont play right. The 1st castle guy wont die or show his health bar. It will just keep going on and on even when I have every card playing. Please fix this. Also I've spent so much money on this game & I thought the updates was supposed to help that. It hasn't! Last thing I'll b@&%h about is the pvp matchup is very unfair. Esp. when I'm not even level 4 & u match me with others who are way higher. I just dont get that!",
            "I give this game five stars because the graphics are great. One thing I really admire about this game is the character selection. They have so many people to collect and upgrade. As some one who really loves South Park it's good to know that they still keep the creativity and negativity, I thank everyone who created the show and this amazing game.",
            "KICK A**! I see all these negative comments, but it looks as though the game has been updated and fixed. And you don't have to spend actual money on this game to have fun, they give you so many options to earn what you need to upgrade your cards, earn money and C points and more. But you guys who complain are the younger generation from me. You don't understand games like I do. Im the keyboard cowboy...ironic name, hu? Lol anyways Creators, just wanna say thnx. But mostly to Matt & Trey."

            "I had high hopes for this app and the fact it is subscription based. The advertising is very different from what is offered in the app and having the Augmented reality VR always prompt to open my brower to view it is unnecessary. And to go on a virtual tour you are requred to install separate apps. Please have everything in one app make it a stand alone experience and give people the option to try it and not have to sign up for a free trial first. Have limited options for the free experience.",
            "An exceptional experience, the VR places you right inside the story, it's quite an experience, and a fresh new perspective.  Lots of items to explore in 3d with detailed descriptions, it was a unique learning experience to be able to view and interact with the objects of Biblical times, and then to see them right in front of you. Also has puzzles, coloring, stickers, lots of content for all ages. Fantastic app!",
            "This is really cool! It's awesome to see what the tabernacle looked like or the tools made for the tabernacle right in my own living room! Or even angels appearing in my bedroom! The puzzles, sticker books, and coloring books are perfect to keep kids attention and focused on sacred things - especially while you're trying to get a little spiritual nourishment yourself! Use it as a family - experience it on your own - this app is a perfect companion to anyone's Bible study!",
            "Really enjoying this! Great way to have fun with biblical stories and content. Wholesome games and activities my kids can play without me being concerned about the content. Loving this and can't wait for more!",

Dev response to everyone is \"we can't fix an Android Samsung 10 problem\", even when people say they don't have that phone. The stock response even sounds angry. No clear desire to solve issues. **Can't run fast enough!!",

            "It was a fantastic platform until they sold out for ad placement. You used to be able to swipe right and see a list of your friends stories that was easy to navigate until they replaced it with the Discover section, leaving at least myself with a far greater struggle of navigating my friends content to the point that it makes me stop using the app at times. I'm sorry but I didn't get a private picture messaging app to try and find trendy stuff, the only reason I still use it is my friends do.",
            "Snapchat is a nice app in concept, however there are quite a few issues. Sending and receiving photos works great. But the UI adds too many extra things that are unhelpful. Quick add below my messages in the chat section? Why I just want to see my current friends and snaps. Extra stories from sources other than my friends and no way to hide them. It's labeled \"for you\" but I don't want them. Ads in-between friends stories.",
            "I have a samsung and recently the app has stopped working as it used to. For large stretches of the day I am not able to send or receive any snaps (snaps I try to send fail, and when people send me snaps they show up 'delivered', looking as if I have already viewed them when I haven't). It is not a network issue as I have tried it on 2 wifi networks as well as using data.",
            "Back to their old ways I've been using snapchat for years. Everytime they used to update, I would not receive notifications. There was a time where there was an emergency and my friend messaged me through snap, previous to this I was receiving notifications just fine but after the update my friends message did not appear on my phone. By the time I had opened the message it was too late (my friend is okay now). But the point is that snapchat has gotten crazy with updates and its affecting people",
            "It's overall a great app and I love using it but in the last month or so I haven't been able to see that people are messaging me (and my siblings are having the same problem). It will sometimes tell me that someone is typing or someone sent a snap but most of the time I'll look on snapchat and someone will have sent me a snap hours earlier and it never told me. I looked on settings to see if I had turned of notifications and I looked on certain people's names but I didn't find anything. Recent."

            "Update 5.0 replaced most battles with \"skips\". Turn the game on, Skip 700 battles, auto-pvp for 10 times in 2 modes, turn it off. As for guild war, the same pay-to-win guild has been #1 since the game's launch. The devs really need to balance things so other people have some chance. Anyone who tries their best to get that gw win just once will be sorely disappointed and might as well go play something else. Same people are always #1 in all other modes too. It's a joke.",
            "Played this game for a couple of years. It was fun! But, I slowly saw it go from time2win to pay2win. I used to just let my phone run so I could grind the best 6 star armour. Every now and then they have specialty characters I would purchase for a couple of bucks. Nothing expensive though. But now I can't even fight bosses w/o paying for a \"skip\" token? I can't even get the option to choose valor like I did before! Welp, guess it's time to move on to another mobile game.",
            "I really enjoyed this game for several months and it was the only one of these types of games I spent money on. it has been a generous game and the one experience i had with customer service was good. The latest patch however 5.0 i think, was a disappointment. It took the fun out of it for me. Adding new features is generally a positive, but not when you overwrite other features. It made it ungrindable. I haven't really been interested to play after trying the new update.",
            "With the new update you really don't have the chance to play ,the skip system won't let you see how your heirs are doing in the dungeon because don't allow to see the fights so if you don't see the fights how you gonna chose the heir that fit you . I consider the developers need to give us the option to chose between skip and use valors. Thanks",
            "Don't bother with this game, you'll soon realize you can't keep up as a f2p player. New unit every other month that is broken so they can release the next one to control it, rinse and repeat since the beginning if the game. Now with 5.0 update they completely gutted the game of what made it unique. Add in the worst type of content in gacha: gear/rune crafting. Materials for this type of content dominate drops from gear/rune dungeons, crafted gears/runes are notoriously worse than farmed version"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "Typical google chaotic mess... Google dumps apps, replacement to come at some point in the future... Don't hold your breath! Buy an app on your phone... Can't install the companion on your watch as the play store won't allow repurchase and gives no option to just install... Am at the point where I hope google does get split up by the US senate... Maybe then we will get some competition and decent freaking applications with support!! Google currently SUCKS!",
            "I have tried to connect my Oppo watch. Application freezes at 8-10% I have tried previous versions, nothing... Tried other devices the same... Disappointing. Now I must wait for Google to fix this so I can use my smartwatch.... Till then I can admire it in its box. I was a huge fan of wear os... From now on.... NEVER AGAIN :) :)",
            "Functional but I do feel it's gone backwards. I don't even have the option to show battery levels now. Must be something wrong in the licensing agreements as less and less people despite this being the future of tech seem to be using. Mobile and search being Googles main stay. Feels the same for Home platforms. I'm a Google fan but watch out for the monster that ate blackberry",
            "I recently updated this app, and none of my notifications pop up anymore! They don't even notify me until I have to open up my phone again, is there anyway possible ya'll can fix this?",
            "Ever since I update the application, I can't even receive any notifications (whatsapp, IG, Facebook, email etc). I have tried restarting my Oppo Watch four times and and my phone three times but to no avail. I don't want to do a factory reset my watch since I dont want to lose my data and especially since I can't guarantee it will works as usual. And please dont tell me to inform this on your Wear Os Community because I did emailed to you yesterday and I haven't receive any feedback from you."

        "description": "A threefold pattern of praising, listening, and responding is how Christians pray. We honor God and give thanks. Then we listen to God through Bible readings, in quiet moments of intentional waiting for God’s voice, and sometimes through other people’s words. And finally we respond to God, giving the love of our hearts and the renewed dedication of our lives, interceding for others, and receiving a blessing. Whether we are young or old, in families or as individuals, accustomed to formal prayers or spontaneous ones, Christians naturally pray in this three-part form. This collection of prayers reflects this familiar way of praying.\r\nThe words of these prayers are taken directly from the Bible or use words minimally adapted from it. In each service we read a psalm portion, a Gospel text, and another scripture passage. The structure of the services, the three calls—to praise, discipleship, and intercession—use scripture words, as do the words of thanksgiving and (in the evening) confession. Every service includes a Gospel song—of Zechariah, Mary, or Simeon—or a recitation of the Beatitudes or an early Christian hymn. In each service we pray the Lord’s Prayer and hear a biblical benediction.\r\nEarly Anabaptists learned much scripture by heart; we hope that those who use these services will be inspired to do the same. We trust that by praying these scripture-saturated prayers, you will find your moments and your days and nights suffused with “the remembered Word,” a hallmark of Anabaptist spirituality.\r\nThe prominent place given to Jesus in these prayers also resonates with a sixteenth-century Anabaptist concern: following Christ in life. The themes chosen for the prayers for ordinary time are important elements in the New Testament witness to Jesus: the Lord’s Prayer (the focus of Week 1), the Beatitudes (Week 2), the parables of Jesus (Week 3), and the signs and wonders performed by Jesus (Week 4). The prayers for the seasons of the church year focus our attention on Jesus’ coming; his cross (seen as of a piece with his preaching, teaching, and healing ministry), resurrection, and ascension; and the coming of his Spirit on the church. The focus on Jesus’ life and teachings in the services is intended to aid us in deeply internalizing Jesus’ example and his words of challenge and comfort.\r\nThe scriptures selected reflect intensive work to identify foundational texts of early Anabaptists. Selections also speak to concerns of Anabaptists today, such as peace, justice, ecology, feminist sensitivities, ecumenical commitments, and regard for each testament, in its own right, as God’s inspired word.\r\nThis collection of prayers has found a place in many settings. People use it to lead devotions at committee meetings and conferences and in small groups, congregations shape morning worship on its pattern, ministers offer pastoral prayers informed by its petitions, student groups gather around it, individuals use it for personal prayer. Families who have never held devotions report that this collection has enabled them to enjoy reading Scripture and praying together: school-age children lead their own parts of the service, and younger ones learn the repeated elements by heart and offer their own prayers of thanks and petitions in the spaces for free prayer.\r\nThis mobile app makes these prayer services available to users in an easy-to-navigate format, as close at hand as your digital device. Features include navigation to a recommended service for the date and time of day, tracking to keep your place in the sequence of services, an ability to call up particular services, introductory materials and extensive indices that enable searches for particular texts. You can also select preferred versions of repeated elements (Glory, canticles, the Lord’s Prayer), which are then embedded in the service you are praying.",

            "Love this. It's great for increasing your Spanish vocabulary. It's hard to hear the sound of the woman (or computer) saying and pronuncing the words you're studying before the game though since the background music is so loud. If you could turn the word audio up that would help or at least adda settings button to control the two volumes. Thanks.",
            "Great idea, however the english script is... Problematic. And the words don't mach perfectly, oftenly converting between singular and plurl forms. All in all though, it's a welcome change of scenery",
            "Call me a cynic but this is mostly a cash grab to get you to unlock skills/dungeons, the choice of words is completely random and just feels amateurish (some are capitals randomly) rather than trying to teach the user a language by picking the best words to learn. Not recommend. Go to Kindle and just buy a useful phrase or top 500 word guide, will be far more useful.",
            "Pretty fun game. Doesn't let me watch ads for double coins even though the option is there",

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

They change because everything that’s alive grows and changes. There is a time when girls and boys do more than just grow taller and bigger as they have done since birth. \r\n\r\nGirls start to grow into young women sometime between the ages of eight or nine and ﬁfteen. Boys start to grow into young men sometime between the ages of nine or ten and ﬁfteen. Puberty is one of the names given to this span of time. The word puberty comes from the Latin word pubertas, which means grown-up or adult. \r\n\r\nWhen people use the word puberty, they are usually talking about all the physical changes that take place in kids’ bodies during this time. Most of these changes make it physically possible for a female and a male to make a baby. The other word that is used to describe the span of time between childhood and adulthood is adolescence. \r\n\r\nThe word adolescence comes from the Latin word adolescere, which means to grow up.

Puberty, or adolescence, is an in-between time — when a boy or girl is not a child anymore but is not yet an adult. Girls often start puberty when they are nine or ten or eleven years old. \r\n\r\nBoys often start puberty a year or so later — when they are ten or eleven or twelve. For most kids, puberty takes place over a stretch of time — over a few years. This usually gives kids time to get used to their adult bodies. \r\n\r\nThe many changes that take place in our bodies during puberty are caused by hormones.

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

This is the most horrible experience I ever encountered!!!",
            "All of the reviews describe how hard it is to cancel... I also experience that.... the customer support email just kept saying I had to fax... I don't even have a fax... I mean honestly, to have to fax a termination fir a digital app is just a way to make it difficult to leave... by chance I saw that there is an unsubscribe option in the playstore.... I really hope my cancellation has worked! And your response to all these complaints is that you have multiple ways of termination.... Rubbish!!!",
            "The women are fake and you can't cancel your subscription as they give you the run around in the end I had no choice but to cancel my credit card or else they will just keep taking money from your account and they keep sending threatening emails if I dont pay so why should I pay for something that I did not subscribe further than the first month money hungry scammers is all they are!!!!!"

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 🌟 is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

            "Game features are really good and detailed. The more I play, the more features I get to discover. Joining alliance and battling with others felt the most innovative and interesting, not to mention making friends and allies just as your game character. There are different means to earn golds too which is rare. There was a huge glitch problem which wasn't allowing me to play for more than a minute or two, but thanks to the developers, it's now solved fully and I can play freely and smoothly.",
            "Really fun game! Different from how it was advertised though, but it's ok. I've been playing for around 157days, and I've been active daily. Many people commented that it's a game that requires money to achieve high ranks, but that's not really true. As long as u put ur resources in the right places, n during events, u'll be able to rank well! Like within the top 100. It's fun to challenge myself n c how high a rank I can go without paying a single cent. :) It's nice to chat with other players!",
            "Money-hungry. Servers die less than a year. I like this game because I met a lot of people and able to be friends with. I do still enjoy this game. The issue is that it really, really, really is a pay-to-win. CME will milk everything they have to offer. They even tweaked the algorithm to give out fewer shards during events. Emperor shards are even more difficult now to get. I have four decent VIP accounts (unlocked all quick buttons) on different servers. Is it worth your money? Definitely not.",
            "Just had the new update and it's disappointing tbh. I get that the game needs to come up with ways to make money so that it can keep giving out great content but can CME at least not make the events even more difficult than they already are. It's true that if you play regularly you will be rewarded but it's tiring and now I'm kind of fed up. Before update I could at least play my favourite Jade for Beauty with ease but now it's a CS event and I've got to be here at all hours to keep up rank.",
            "The new art academy to get a superheroine is a joke. You can't call that a game! I don't have a problem with the cost (even though it's absurdly expensive, it takes $500-$2,000 real money to get a superheroine). My problem is how completely boring it is to \"play\" that art academy \"game\" It just spams world chat with notifications from other players. No one in our cross servers likes the game. Reaction was 1/10, everyone hates it. Who approved of this dumb idea? We need more actual FUN mini games"

            "So far its a really good game, the graphics and animations are very well done and the storyline so far is good. Its a tad bit pricey for a mobile mystery adventure game but not terribly. will give 5 stars after I beat it if it holds up til the end. (Developers: Good work Guys! Well done)",
            "Well first off I love this game. storylines solid and the control is easy graphics r ok. I like how the scenes you have actions available are lit up green so u don't have to guess. It helps a lot. I don't like how it's only a demo and then without warning you have to purchase the gsme. By then I was hooked I had to purchase. Well played Five-BN games. Well played. Overall. I recommend this game",
            "I've been playing these Mystery games for sometime now and I love each and everyone of them I've played. The story lines are great and the graphic are awsome...these games are made to where you just have to come back and keep playing them, what I really like is seeing whats in the next game of adventure. I would recomend others to try these games I can promise you one thing you sure wont be disappointed at all. Thanks to the designers who makes these games. keep up the awsome work. Best ever !!",
            "So I love this game so far, but, I don't know why but everytime I try to flick between my items using the arrow buttons on either side of the bar, it doesn't register or takes me out of my items and it's so incredibly frustrating, I thought maybe I just have fat fingers so I tried a stylus and for some reason it's the same and I have little patience so have had to rage quit a couple times and come back when I calm down lol. Please help I really like these games :'( bigger arrows maybe?",
            "I find this game adventure most inthrawling and very well scripted as story is played out, fantastic graphics as normal, great helpful hints and no adverts, all that 5BN games are truly noted for and rightly so; this is a great game you Must purchase very very well Done and my full support for all there future games..."

I realize only a few want to create a decent game. Everybody is all about the ads. Pump out crappy games. Deleting this game too. Received all the ad revenue from me you will get.",
            "This game is not really what it advises I was expecting something completely different. It's quite buggy. But I guess it is decent when comparing to other games in this category though I've played better games like this such as meeting cats or other animals where to buy your and such to get extra so I don't know I didn't play it too long before uninstalling but it just felt meh I had no interest in it.",
            "So I downloaded this game and so far I've really liked it and intended to beat it and show my friends but as soon as I got to oberon (the 4th world) I stop getting free spins and my rare mission is stuck at 12 hours except when I'm playing it, but it might be at 11 hours and 50 minutes when I leave the game and when I come back it will have restarted the time!!!!😡😡😡",
            "Used to be a fun game that I wanted to come back to but timers only work in-game which could be an exploit for boosters but it's a disadvantage for missions. Also I remember getting three spins every few hours which I guess doesn't happen anymore? Total downgrade.",
            "Doesn't add spins with time. It says you can have up to 12 but the only way to addore is to get to 0 and add 3 with an add. Also, no timers advance when closed...neither does income. Let me know of you fix these and I'll update this review. Unplayable idle at the later stages as it is..."

If you guys do all of the advertisemend and stuffs, Inviting all of the people around the world. Updating this and thst, upgrading and making it looks more great. I'm sure s lot of people like 5 years ago will play this game and we can meet a lot of player. Please......",
            "Im rating this game 5 stars because its just gold. Best mmorpg on mobile its really sad that gameloft left it out because they can make amazing updates to this game like update it not graphicly just content. It would mean a world to all of use old rpg players the game is still alive even when you didn't update for last 2 years.",
            "Order & Chaos Online is by far a great action MMORPG mobile game, this game has lot's of quests, you can customize the character, you can also play this game with friend's, chat, battle, also duels. Their are no future updates as in not coming, with newer ones to be updated. Choices of five characters, Humans and Elves fight for Order, Orcs and Undead for Chaos, Mendels are neutral referred to as the chosen ones. This game uses lots of GB storage. You can also create guilds.",
            "Played from Release on IOS to a few weeks into the last time it was updated. The first few years were a fantastic game and I would still argue the best MMORPG mobile has ever seen was pre level70 cap if not the whole time the game didn't have any sort of paid features. Its a shame they got greedy and gave up on the game if they kept up with it or even pull up old Level 60 servers up to EHL it would compete with the best out right now.",
            "I personally am enjoying the hell out of this game!!! I started playing about 2h ago and ive been glued to the game since it really feels like world of warcraft i haf to give 4 stars though cause the joystick needs some work my guy will just stop runing in combat thats bad cause i dont always wanna fight but steller game guys :D"

            "I randomly came across this, and at this point in life, it doesn't apply to me, but I wanted to say how great a game/app this is. Though it's small and somewhat limited in its content, it is definitely very calming. The sounds of nature are peaceful and the \"rock pool\" is soothing.   I walked around for a little bit, collected a few gems, and listened to a couple stories, and it really brought me close to tears. Real people, real experiences, real time. I like how you can share your story anonymously, and have people listen to it and learn how to handle their own situations through the words of those who have moved on.   It's deep, meaningful, and private. Like a diary in a way.   Very nice app. I would recommend it to anyone struggling to find peace or closure within themselves due to loss.   Small, but worthwhile.",
            "Wow. Its not often that i rate games, but apart of me is simply too amazing to ignore. It teaches you so much, with all the great mechanics of an adventure game mixed in with touching life lessons about how to deal with loss and feelings. I wish more pure games like this existed, and i really recommend this for anyone, dealing with loss or not. Thank you for this game.",
            "This game has blown my mind, I never thought an app would help me through the grief of my partner who passed away nearly 5 years ago when I was pregnant. The crystal calming techniques help me to relax, the little messages along the way really make me feel good. Fabulous app! I'm very socially awkward and have been waiting for counseling but this is really helping me grieve. Thank you so much!!",
            "It's a bummer to see some of these negative reviews. I wonder if people are giving it a fair shot or thinking it's supposed to be a different type of game. This is such a helpful and relaxing experience. It can help with ANY type of pain/trauma/anxiety. As for the navigation being \"slow\", some of the reason is because you are doing quests to help you with your journey. You are supposed to be mindful. Well done guys!",
            "I only feel negative how wrong the introduction is worded. Loss of the love one, doesn't just mean they died. They could be very much alive and it will hit and hurt the same, if not even the worse. Game itself seems to be neatly designed and looks nice. Although, it could use performance optimization. Now whatever or not it will really help with the problem it was made for, remains to be seen it's too early to say or give an overall impression."

Genius idea, so user friendly, great layout, so simple and yet so completely wonderful! I have only one request - please please please make an iPhone version too, I'm changing phones and I can't live without this app!!!",

            "I memorize scriptures every week using your app. I wish that you had the ability to sync; I am disappointed in having to set up my multiple devices and not having them sync; unlike the scriptures — they sync using all devices that I own. If could sync I would give it a 5 rating and would even be able to send monies to you in developing other apps.",
            "I like being able to Import scripture directly from Gospel Library & Doctrinal Mastery. The ability to also add journal entries for each scripture is great. I plan to use this to not only ponder, but to track and memorize scriptures that are meaningful to me to change my life at important juncture in my life. In this manner it compliments Gospel Library which is my main course. This app allows focus on specific scriptures that I feel need to be added to my life, whereas Gospel Library allows for a broad reach of topics to research, track, correlate, tag, record, append, and move on to the next topic.",
            "Works perfectly. Love the convenience of adding verse from the Gospel Library app. Also nice to have the option of notifications, reminding you to select a new verse to ponderize. I've used this app to memorize The Family: A Proclamation to the World, one paragraph at a time. Thanks for the excellent app!"

            "This game is interesting to play. I gave it five stars because of Storyline. The Graphics was colorful and amazing! The gameplay was channeling but easy. Kudos once again to Domini Games for a work well done.",
            "DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Controls don't work, half of the buttons and places to select are off the screen, the gas witch puzzle can't be completed b/c one piece is under the task book. Selecting the piece opens the book, and exiting the book exits the puzzle, which resets your progress. Refund is processing. When it finishes, I'm uninstalling. Only 3 of your games were worth anything. The other dozen I played were either glitchy or froze up/prevented further play.",
            "I love your games, you always have things that pop out at you or touch a tree and his fly out, I enjoy those little things that you do in your games to surprise. Thanks",
            "Love these games, good value for money, great story lines with a wide range of puzzles (some easy, some difficult). Domini are especially good. I'd play them all day every day if I had my way",
            "This is an update to my previous 1-star review. After the issue I had with the game coming up with the 'unlock game' and not allowing me to continue playing, after I'd already purchased the game and was in the bonus chapter, the company responded promptly. They asked for more info. When I went into game to take a screenshot of 'unlock game- screen, it had 'miraculously' fixed itself. Weird. Whatever. I was able to finish the game without further issue. Great game otherwise."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

That was all it asked for after that there was nothing, no profiles no way of uploading a photo and my name on my profile was \"chinesedate\" also no way of deleting you profile. It was basically empty. STAY AWAY! I have flagged this app.",
            "My experience with the app has been very pleasant. The thought of starting the process of online dating was scary, but I knew it was a step I had to make because I wasn’t finding quality men on my own. The app quickly replaced my fear for dating with excitement. With each date I got less nervous and learned a little more about what I wanted and didn’t want in a man. The app asks you a lot of questions, all of which help give you matches that are similar to you and what you want. And it works, my matches are very much invested in the same things I am. It goes beyond that and also tells you how compatible you are in romance, relationship values, athleticism, accommodation, etc. My advice to you reading this is be open to online dating, give this app a try because you will be glad you did. Yes, putting yourself out there can be scary, but this app will genuinely help you find quality men that are also interested in dating and not just swiping right for the thrill. Good luck! :)",
            "I like the style this app takes with having it so the women message first, but from what I read in some of their bios a lot of the women dont under stand that they have to message first which is annoying. However the reason I am leaving 5 stars is because of the costumer service. Today I realised my account was charged when I had un subscribed and the problem was solved within 10 minutes, the customer service is great and quick!",
            "This app is fake. Before subscription, you'll be receiving messages. After that no one reply. Also, you made a match after every 4 swipe. The question is how is that logical? Google shouldn't send the developer my money but to refund."

I contacted CS and I got some message (24+hrs later) back that told me to please be patient and wait for their new version?! Doesn't really help! It would also be nice if you could swipe to answer a message",
            "Great app with lots of potential of meeting someone special from around the world. They listen to suggestions and take feedback very seriously which is a plus. You might have to buy the premium to get the full experience though but overall, I had a great experience using this.",
            "Terrible. Nothing but bots aimed to get you to spend money. I get everyone wants to make money and if this were legit I would happily pay. But it was clear in less than 12 hours that this was set up to get you spending before any real connection could even take place. Shame shame shame.",

But the thing that caused me to delete the app was the fact it lies about people's locations. I hearted a few but when I went to look at them, all thier locations were very far away. When they were presented, they said they were maybe a city away. Just because I put nearby in my filter doesn't mean you tell me people are close even when they're miles and states away.",

Tip: If someone profile looks blurry, it means they took a screenshot. But again, I love this app so much. Thank you for making it! ❤️?",

Do yourself a Favor, dump all the other Apps and join this app, you’ll be glad you did!",

I know that this is a new thing for a lot of people, but I believe this app allows us to be able to orientate ourselves into a new lifestyle. This app have served very good for me and I am encouraging others who are looking to join to join.",

The platform is unique, clean, simple, and intuitive. Hopefully this app will get more attention."

I will also note that for whatever reason I get the most attention from girls that I am attracted to on matchMe> tinder, hinge, and bumble. That is probably why I like it the most.",

I can't see why, as there is nothing inappropriate about my profile. And if there was, why in the hell wasn't something said about it when I joined the bloody app. You guys better fix this issue, you freaking goblins.",
            "Terrible app. There's no way to do a filtered search based on things most men care about. You just have to browse through what they recommend. Also you pay for a subscription and you have to buy in app currency to get noticed. Save your money and go elsewhere in my opinion. P.s. Take a look at the positive review names, it's almost like they've been auto generated hmmm."
