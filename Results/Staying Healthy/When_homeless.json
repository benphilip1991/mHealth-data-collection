            "I like it along with these types of games, although the main reason why i am typing it out is because I paid 5 bitcoin to not get spotted by police and it lasted up until i hit 15k dollars but now the effect has worn off and i get caught. Is there any way you guys can fix this??? If you do, I'll put the rating back up to 5 stars.",

            "This game is fun, BUT it stalls VERY often and needs to be restarted continually, to the point it is very difficult to play. It is extremely disappointing, because if it were not for the issues with having to restart the game over and over, this would be such a fun game, but it becomes frustrating and takes away from the game in a major way because it is SO often.",
            "The game could be good. The idea is really cool and the way it's laid out would work nicely. But. And it's a very very big but. The game relies very heavily on ads. If you're connected to the internet then you'll get ads at least every minute. If you're not connected, then you don't get access to the ads which give you money, which you will 100% need. Most of the time you won't be making profit in the game and will need the bonus, which is rather stupid. Overall, unless you love ads, leave it.",
            "It's good but there are to many Ads so for now I think 3 stars are fair",
            "Its a pretty fun game you start your life as a hobo and try to become the rich before you turn old. Which you will probably have plenty of time to do. there are a few minor adjustments that could be made to help improve the game even more. Besides that its a really fun game!! and definitly worth trying out. And im seeing a lot of reviews saying there are too many ads but you can just turn of the internet and you dont really need the ads that give you money.",
            "Main issue: way too many ads. I already have to watch ads too keep up with the money, I don't need to watch more after every little thing I do. Also, it gets to the point where you have to spend money on the game or watch ads to keep up with the money. Sure there's stocks & gambling but you can't rely on them to be able to afford anything. For me it's too stressful, especially it being a game."

            "Something is wrong with this game. Almost nothing works and I can't even tell what most things are supposed to be. There are no instructions. No labels on buttons. I was able to find a few buttons that did something among all of the different screens but that's it. One dramatically increased the coins per tap. I then tapped for quite a while to see if somethijg, anything, would happen. Nope. Especially frustrating as the buttons do behave like they are working. Art style is nice, unique.",
            "Itd be neat if there was a button that stops the story slides every time you reset Also (might be my phone not sure) I cant always access the leaderboards Also I think the pets and or backgrounds shouldnt get repeated unless having multiple give some boost another thing it would be nice if master beggar stayed active or paused or maybe like half speed when you go over to other tabs rather than just not letting you go to other tabs and a master beggar upgrade that costs gold potions would be cool",
            "Good app. The grammar is a little bit bad. Not all. Please make a free coins by watching ads. Also the potion. Please 5 or 3 potion per ads pls. Thankyou. Your apps is good. Edit: TY for reply. Hm I also want to ask if can you please make a button where we can on and off the thing below the trainer, i mean the option. So we can play it full screen. Its hard to click when phone is small. Please. I really really love your app. Im willing to watch ads to support you guys. Hehe. Staysafe!",
            "Amazing game! I've spent about $45 on it and I have to say it was money well spent. The grammar's a bit off, but I believe it's the translation. It's a tapping game, you can earn potions to benefit you (or buy them), you can hire people once you get enough coins to get money for you, you can customize your character, the background, and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Overall, really great game!"

If I may I think an income upgrade of some sort or an upgrade for the material to evolve dropping more often could be a fix for this as ive looked through all the menus and I don't see either of these as options when at least the income upgrade is a staple in most idle games.",

But if go in it again it works. Number 2, im kinda sad that the part-time-workers from beggar life are not there :( But otherwise everythings amazing!",
            "Bit Grindy but overall good but I prefer the first. It gets pretty boring after a little I suggest I little bit more action. Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",
            "Amazing idle game. It's like other idle games except it has buildings to purchase. A city you can go into with multiple things to do. And not filled with a ton of ads like Alot of other games. I personally love this game and the people who made it. Well that's all. Great game.",

Storage game data, view and manage google drive data, associate with personal info, see your personal info including your email address and your public data. Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live. Change it to cloud saves like every other idle game on the app store that is 4 stars and up.",

I cannot read the price for the upgrades, it is to hard to see (blue + green) Please make Blue and Red, I cannot read the price for part timers!!! please fix, will give 5! thank you"

            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ❤️",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

            "Amazing game but a problem when you run out of zombie places to raid you have to wait or buy to get a refill I think you shouldn't have to wait or buy",
            "Good gameplay. Only problems are that sometimes I will get an upgrade and nothing will happen. Another problem is that spikes and saws never placed. I bought them and then nothing happened.",
            "It gets difficult in the start, but then it gets a little more easier after a few plays. Here's a tip; When some of your people die during raids, you still have their guns with you when you get home. Trade those guns away for bullets. Bullets are the resources you really need, and don't go upgrading your gun until you have enough metal and wood. Always check your guys in the frontlines, because when people come back from raids, their places, with the original men, may change, which could kill ye",
            "While hard at first glance, once you actually get to know the game it is quite easy. The biggest problem I have with the game is that the difficulty doesn't ramp up. Once you get to a certain point you basically can continue forever. But other then that, this game is excellent overall.",
            "It's a fun game and all, but it's too hard to get resources. It's too hard to get through rounds and the game is overall ass. I'm sorry but the game is WAAAAY too difficult. GG fellow gamers, but this is not a really good game."

            "I'm very picky with games, and this just managed to get past that barrier with stunning graphics and controls, its just a couple things that caught me off-guard. 1. Please add an arachniphobic option for those who need it! 2. Its hard to really progress when the banner keeps coming. 3. I feel like there isn't a good way to get farther. Every time you uninstall it or stop playing for a certain amount of time, it will wipe your data! 4. Everytime you jump, sometimes it pauses it for some reason :\\",
            "The graphics are incredibly amazing for a game that does not lagg very much. I like how tjere are a lot of things to do and you can live either indoor or outdoor and can raise a family too! Though the adds banner does get reaaallly annoying. It comes like everytime I go to sleep. And the skins are quite expensive. I understand you want some money, but maybe you should lower the amount of times the banner shows up.",
            "I underestimated this game. At first, I expected it to be a low quality game like most other simulators, but I was wrong! The graphics are great, I love the family feature and the customization, and especially the house area! Of course, the game can start to feel repetitive and slow, sometimes it just depends on your mood. I think it would be interesting to have more areas (like a modern world, a park, stores), or have more landscapes, like desert and snow. Overall, this is a great game!",
            "I love this game it is the best no bugs or gitches but i do want ,new places like the basement in the house and more mushrooms not amanitas , and you can add upstairs in the house or a grocery store and i wish the cats in the game could have kittens and for the mice more babies at 1 time pls, and add humans! well nice game!",
            "Still too sensitive and now the game is way too difficult. you spend all your time gathering instead od exploring like before. and by the time you half finish one quest you're too tired and hunrgy to get much farther. in short, this game got worse since I last played it in 2017"

        "comments": [
            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

You may be suffering right now, in pain, in financial difficulty, grieving for a lost loved one, brokenhearted, sick, jobless, homeless, stressed, alone, rejected or feeling depressed.  But such times need not overcome our hope.  HOPE is not something that depends upon our circumstances, talent, skills or resources. That is reasonable expectation. Our true hope depends upon a person who loves us most and a God in whom all things are possible – JESUS CHRIST!\r\n\r\n“Then you will know that I am Yahweh and that those who hope in me will not be put to shame.” – Isaiah 49:23, CCB\r\n\r\nThis app will lead you through words of hope which includes self-help articles and even poems that will help kindle the light of hope in your heart:\r\n\r\n-When You Feel Pulled Down\r\n-A Hope That Doesn’t Disappoint Us\r\n-Things to Remember During Very Difficult Times\r\n-The Meaning of Life\r\n-My God, Why Have You Forsaken Me?\r\n-How Will God Provide For My Needs?\r\n-Why Seek The Invisible God\r\n-When You’re Too Tired to Hope\r\n-To Believe What The Eyes Cannot See\r\n-When You’re Too Tired to Hope\r\n\r\nHope is when we see something that is not yet truly there.

But I guess it is decent when comparing to other games in this category though I've played better games like this such as meeting cats or other animals where to buy your and such to get extra so I don't know I didn't play it too long before uninstalling but it just felt meh I had no interest in it.",

            "Doesn't add spins with time. It says you can have up to 12 but the only way to addore is to get to 0 and add 3 with an add. Also, no timers advance when closed...neither does income. Let me know of you fix these and I'll update this review. Unplayable idle at the later stages as it is..."

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 🌟 is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

I'm listening to my audiobook and have been tapping for 20 minutes and still there is no option to turn off the sound. It's also incredibly dumb that you can't tap tap and upgrade at the same time, and there is no \"buy max\" button. This tutorial is going on forever, I hate being railroaded by a game Edit: apparently the railroading never stops. Uninstalling",
            "It keeps you busy at night and it's just a game to keep you distracted when you need it in the game you save up money and you tap to Rainbow and the more you tap the more buildings you can buy the house gets upgraded it's really fun and I've already playing it for 2 hours",
            "Wants to give us random ads during play but when it comes time for ads to double prizes like being offline for 9 hours and double that income suddenly ads no longer will load and you lose the double income. Had daily reward and went to watch ad to exchange only to get no reward at all",

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

I can't wait and I'm so excited to hear that. So the new update will make us die at age 200. I hope that we can have family soon so our children will inherit what we've established in our life here :)",
            "Oh that's good then and there's no need to rush the updates, just wanted to make sure everything is alright, take your time with the updates. I think the game has potential, keep trying your best",
            "Great idea for a game, looking foward to the updates. But currently i cant buy any food or nothing at the markets. Is that a bug or am i doing something wrong? When i click buy nothing happens. Update: Yeah that was the problem, my bad and thanks. Changed rating to 5.",
            "I love this game! Its in a creation stage so you get to be in on the ground floor while its being designed. Very fun and imaginative, nothing like any other Ive played! Kudos to the developer!!!",
            "Truly the only thing bad about it is that it's hard to get a house. But other than that, I like the game!"

I did one piercing and I am uninstalling!! If I could rate this game lower than one star, TRUST ME!! This would have a negative 1000 star rating! Never again!",
            "This game is an absolute joke. To many ads, and even if you pass on the upgrades it will still play at least one ad after every level some times more. You spend more time watching ads then you do playing the game. I've only done 3 piercings and I will be deleting this game. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!",
            "This was a huge disappointment the game itself is a great design but after doing 2 people the game wigs out and makes it where you cant see anything so you have to close the app and reopen it , and not to mention when you're in the middle of doing something and then an add pops up not before or after no in the middle. Needs alot of work",
            "Everything is very far off from where your finger actually is on the screen. You have to watch ads to do literally anything in the game, and, on top of those ads you have to watch to progress, you also get random ones too. I get that they need ads to make money, but this is ridiculous. Why have games come to this?",
            "Yeah everybody's right about this game is way too many ads nobody should get this game cuz there's so much else you can't even play the game I got past the first episode then there's that and then I couldn't afford that because the video was so long and then I had to watch another ad before I picked it a different ear piercing and another add another another"

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection.

There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead.

Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse?

        "recentChanges": "– Added possibility to auto-clear the locations.<br>– Added random variations for many locations (currently, the number of random options is limited).<br>– Added gifts that you can get for rating the game.<br><br>– Added a level restriction on the clan chest, also new clan members will not be able to use the clan chest for 3 days after joining.<br>– The &quot;Prison&quot; location update time increased to 120 minutes.<br><br>– Added new translations.<br>– Added the option to study a recipe or learn a skill for direct payment.",

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "Great game, its a good way to pass the time. Bit difficult to grasp what to do in the beginning but once you get the hang of it then its great fun. 30/10/2020 Um.... what happened guys? This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

            "Hey guy's I'm on season 89 an I've a massive time out lost so much that i spent four hours playing the event this morning an when I went to log back in it went back to the start. So can someone please have a look at what is going on an try to fix it. I don't pay for anything I just send the time watching the ads an I've been playing trailer park boys for almost 3 years now so if you could have a look at what is going on it would be much appreciated cheers 🤘✌😎",
            "I quite enjoy the game, been playing for ages now! I love the frequent themed events put on each week. The story lines throughout are funny and the ads that people moan about aren't that imposing! I don't even know how long it's been since I started this game but I'm definitely carrying on for a long time! It's the one and only game that's lasted so long on my phone!",
            "Used to be awesome, now it's all ads, and half the ads are broken. I have played this game for years, and ever since they introduced the watch ads to double income after idle, I can't catch up with the events. I've honestly never considered deleting this until now but when half of the ads don't pay out the reward, I can't even place now, and I have tried even paying actual money, ugh. And why do I have to watch these ads now just to place in events when I used to be able to just fine? Meh",
            "The game gives the illusion of strategy. It takes advantage of TPB fans, and the only reason I played as long as I did was because I thought the devs actually cared about the players experience, but that has turned out too definitely not be the case. I had to learn that just because they respond doesn't mean they care at all if you're being ripped off.",
            "The game is fun and can be addictive if you enjoy idle games. There are some technical problems that I've run into though. Often it doesn't register daily login rewards or if you exit an event and come back to it later it won't register changes you made prior to leaving the event. I've had the game set me back hours before and that's pretty crappy when you are competing for prizes on a leaderboard."

If I was epileptic I probably would've had a seizure. The game keeps crashing, even on my other device. It's been nearly 2 hrs and I still cant play. But game looks good, so I'll rate it 3 stars at least.",
            "This game is a great resource/idle type game. The ads aren't intrusive, the art design and sound are great. This is a perfect pick up and play type of game, with the random events and nicely tuned progression more than making up for the relative lack gameplay. The in-app purchases are fairly done as well, never feeling like you're being forced into them, but also being a great way to boost impatient players. Definitely give this game a try!",
            "This is a fun little time burner and the aesthethic is charming. Gameplay is cathartic when things are made. The character are unique and give a retro feel. However this game is a bit lacking in depth, logic, and personality. For starters the equipment system is a bit rubbish, when a character get's something new, the old piece is lost to the void. It's a bit counterintuitive when survivor's can't be wasteful. It would make more sense if the old tool broke and the option to make a new one.",

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "This would be a pretty good clone of the warioware games, but there were two issues that I had with the game. First, the solution for some of the minigames aren't clear. I had trouble understanding what you were supposed to do in some of the minigames. Second, Your not given enough time to figure out each minigame. Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",
            "I don't like the game,because it asks the same questions. When you do something wrong you lose points. So I prefer you should not down load this game. It is boring to I got to say. No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!😡",

            "I adore this game, I just wish that there was an option to turn off the tilting games. As someone with shaking hands (and mine are far from the worst) I always end up dying in these rounds, and it ruins the gameplay.",
            "This app was a little bit of a disappointment to me. The app is very glitchy and I try and click things bit it just won't work. Some of the levels are hard to a aggravating way. I am definitely deleting this app. And I do not recommend this to anyone."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

I've also had a lot of issues with steps being converted to sweat coins (it will track that I've walked 12,000 steps but only convert 100). I sent a request for help and never got a reply. Read one of the responses to a review and you guys tell people to submit tickets but you have an automated message respond saying that they pretty much never check it. Wth.",
            "Love this app, its not easy to build sweatcoins but if you save them you can earn some pretty cool stuff. I walk a ton for work so its generally easy to accumulate them. The offers update every few days so it always feels fresh. They also have awesome humanitarian causes you can donate your coins to. I would rate this app 10/5 if I could. Its engaging yet not overwhelming, one of my favorites i constantly recommend the app to my friends and coworkers",
            "Please fix my account. I have exactly 938,814 steps that keep adding up and wont caluculate to the sweatcoins. I have the right setting and everthing and no battery saver or anything. Im not sure if there is a problem with the app or if they are just scamming me when my coins actuly start to add up after 2 years.(update) i uninstalled and reinstalled and its counting again but i lost the 938,814 steps that never got calculated. Is there a way you could put these back onto my account.",
            "Whenever I use this app or hit 2× boost it starts counting steps then it will stop like every 10 to 15 sec for at least 20 sec at a time , the timer is stil going but not counting the steps . I am 67 yrs old and was so excited about this app . Some days its so hard to get started excercising but I make myself so I can stay fit. Please fix this !!!",
            "I've been a loyal sweatcoin user for over 2 years with no issues until recently. The app will continuously stop tracking my steps for no reason.

            "It's a great game, it includes a match 3 game on a turtle island and a boat race game and treasure chests, plenty of tasks and you can help the guests as well, there are cute animals to unlock and so much territory to expand. I just have one problem. If you want to restart and clear everything, that's not going to happen. It's what I wanted to do, and another thing is, building and clearing trees and rocks takes alot of energy, although you only get 25 energy. But you can still play the games",
            "I have played this game for a few minutes, and I'm quite surprised at what I found. The gameplay is like any other game, and it forces you for the first few builds to place them in spots as it seems. It doesn't really give us much freedom in how we want our resort to look like. The little mini games in the so called 'sea monster' is like any other, not giving the uniqueness of the game. I have found these types of mini games on beautiful games, but they're all the same, where's the uniqueness?",
            "I would give it a 5, because I'm in love with this game, IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BREAK THE BANK TO GET ANYWHERE ON IT!!! I'm order to get the nice buildings and level up fast, or win tournaments you have to buy not only tons of gems, but you ALSO HAVE TO BUY THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE REALLY RARE AND UNIQUE. I'VE SPENT TIME IN THIS GAME. BUT I'M ABOUT TO JUST DELETE IT. THIS IS CRAZY.",
            "I Have been looking for a new farming game experience and I believe that I have found it. I haven't been playing for very long but so far it is great. I'm not usually fond of energy games but this so far is worth it. There is so much to do that You never get board. If it wasn't for needing energy I would play all the time. Good job and I deffintly would recommend this game.",
            "I played a lot of games of this type but really, this keeps me interested. There are lots of things to do just don't get addicted to it as it will keep you on your seat. The graphics is amazing. I just don't like the tourists' badges being on top of other collectible buildings when tapping. Buildings and upgrade are expensive to be honest unless you wanna go with money power. It's hard to earn too."

            "Not the best game play. Gets boring quick. You get 3 swords per day which are necessary to clear land. Game play is limited to clicking on items on the beach which have various time limits or growing crops which also have time limits. No way to increase your number of workers unless you stumble upon one clearing land. All in all it could be better with some work from the programmers.",
            "Money or nothing. I normally just uninstall a game and find another if I dislike it, but this game is just too awful. From the very start, unless you spend real money, you will get nowhere in this game. You need machetes to do pretty much anything. However, you have to buy them. Ads for them are annoying and pop up often. I have spent hours trying to get them for free. Nothing. Well, I found ONE. So, if you want to play this game, have your money ready.",
            "this game could be an awsome game, BUT it is consistently freezing up or just stops playing, and then you loss so many swords trying to get back the quests that you've done and lost, and gold, thens there's the constant reboot of the same queats you already have . now I do understand this for those that have missed them to beable to do them, but come on , with those of us that have them can't we bypass them ( instead of wasting swords and gold ) . and there more , but I only have limitedtime",
            "Played for about a month. Game is quite unstable. Characters travel too slowly between tasks. Too many popups at game initiation. Popup saying everyone is busy you have to physically close is wholly unnecessary. Someone is always \"tinkering with the server\" making game unavailable for many hours, as long as an entire day.",
            "I installed it only to find that they want to be able to make and manage phone calls to even start the game. Why do you need to make phone calls? This is my tablet and I don't want you managing anything like that! That dialog box also hides why you need my email and device ID. I just saw your response! I am so impressed a human being answered and that it was a clear answer! I don't invite friends, and I really think that there should be an option to not give that information. Thx!"

            "It's a great game, it includes a match 3 game on a turtle island and a boat race game and treasure chests, plenty of tasks and you can help the guests as well, there are cute animals to unlock and so much territory to expand. I just have one problem. If you want to restart and clear everything, that's not going to happen. It's what I wanted to do, and another thing is, building and clearing trees and rocks takes alot of energy, although you only get 25 energy. But you can still play the games",
            "I have played this game for a few minutes, and I'm quite surprised at what I found. The gameplay is like any other game, and it forces you for the first few builds to place them in spots as it seems. It doesn't really give us much freedom in how we want our resort to look like. The little mini games in the so called 'sea monster' is like any other, not giving the uniqueness of the game. I have found these types of mini games on beautiful games, but they're all the same, where's the uniqueness?",
            "I would give it a 5, because I'm in love with this game, IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BREAK THE BANK TO GET ANYWHERE ON IT!!! I'm order to get the nice buildings and level up fast, or win tournaments you have to buy not only tons of gems, but you ALSO HAVE TO BUY THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE REALLY RARE AND UNIQUE. I'VE SPENT TIME IN THIS GAME. BUT I'M ABOUT TO JUST DELETE IT. THIS IS CRAZY.",
            "I Have been looking for a new farming game experience and I believe that I have found it. I haven't been playing for very long but so far it is great. I'm not usually fond of energy games but this so far is worth it. There is so much to do that You never get board. If it wasn't for needing energy I would play all the time. Good job and I deffintly would recommend this game.",
            "I played a lot of games of this type but really, this keeps me interested. There are lots of things to do just don't get addicted to it as it will keep you on your seat. The graphics is amazing. I just don't like the tourists' badges being on top of other collectible buildings when tapping. Buildings and upgrade are expensive to be honest unless you wanna go with money power. It's hard to earn too."

Game play is limited to clicking on items on the beach which have various time limits or growing crops which also have time limits. No way to increase your number of workers unless you stumble upon one clearing land. All in all it could be better with some work from the programmers.",
            "Money or nothing. I normally just uninstall a game and find another if I dislike it, but this game is just too awful. From the very start, unless you spend real money, you will get nowhere in this game. You need machetes to do pretty much anything. However, you have to buy them. Ads for them are annoying and pop up often. I have spent hours trying to get them for free. Nothing. Well, I found ONE. So, if you want to play this game, have your money ready.",
            "this game could be an awsome game, BUT it is consistently freezing up or just stops playing, and then you loss so many swords trying to get back the quests that you've done and lost, and gold, thens there's the constant reboot of the same queats you already have . now I do understand this for those that have missed them to beable to do them, but come on , with those of us that have them can't we bypass them ( instead of wasting swords and gold ) . and there more , but I only have limitedtime",
            "Played for about a month. Game is quite unstable. Characters travel too slowly between tasks. Too many popups at game initiation. Popup saying everyone is busy you have to physically close is wholly unnecessary. Someone is always \"tinkering with the server\" making game unavailable for many hours, as long as an entire day.",
            "I installed it only to find that they want to be able to make and manage phone calls to even start the game. Why do you need to make phone calls? This is my tablet and I don't want you managing anything like that! That dialog box also hides why you need my email and device ID. I just saw your response! I am so impressed a human being answered and that it was a clear answer! I don't invite friends, and I really think that there should be an option to not give that information. Thx!"

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

Like 4.99 and 10.99 or 35.99$ for some people that can be alot and that's just if you want TO SAVE the video YOU MADE. But there is some really cool templates. But I really wish I could of given this app a 5 star or at least a 4 star but no I had to give it a 3 stars. :(",
            "This app is great! It exports your videos very quickly, but I'm giving this a 4 star review because it doesn't really let you pick the music you want, it already gives you music with a type of style. Then again, this app is amazing and doesn't cost money to do the videos, so great job :)",
            "I just downloaded this app and it seems pretty cool and fun but it's already having some issues and it's only been five minutes. I picked out a few photos for a video and after pushing play the music in the video started skipping right away it only played part of it then kicked me out.",
            "This truly is a great app I realised that you don't exactly have to pay for everything even though there is a pro option it's perfectly fine because you don't have to pay for it and a lot of the templates are actually just for Free really good and you can remove the watermark too",
            "Extreamly beautiful app i have ever seen before for beat edting... But i suggest please add the favourite option in which users can add their favorite templates. And search option As well. Such an amazing Application. 😘😍 Thank you"

            "Been playing for awhile and got enough coins to cash out for a voucher, however everything is showing as sold out. I'm using the UK version so maybe people will have a better experience in other countries. Update I have logged in several times through the day and all show as sold out. I also do not understand the new piggy bank, how do you collect nuts and bolts?, how do you heist from other players?",
            "It was good. Then it was not so good, introduced piggy bank... A way to spend tokens in hopes of winning more. Prize was tokens and blackjack hands. New piggy is worse.. I don't even get tokens, just get jerked around by the piggy. I know I will never get the last nickel to cash out at$10, doesn't bother me, liked the gift cards. I know I will never get anything from the piggy. I just keep coming back hoping I will get one last gift card. And I cannot find your help center.",
            "Worst app ever!!!. Once you are approaching the minimum withdrawal then they won't give you any cash anymore and, I am just 0.15 away.They just let you watch a lot of advertisements over and over again. I won't recommend this app. Now they have an update to heist from some other players too. Nah it just goes on in circles over and over again.No withdrawal has been made.I have been playing it for a while. Highly won't recommend this app.",
            "Waste of time. Period. Deleting now with no regrets despite being $0.25 away from cashing out (For 1-2weeks of multi-daily check-ins to the app). My gut says I'll never see a dime and my time is better spent elsewhere on games and activities I actually enjoy. Download at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you! Edit: After that response, I'm confident that I'm right. They make vague and empty promises so they can make more money through their scam.",
            "Has been slow for cash payouts but I have gotten a few gift cards.. Now this app sucks. Doesn't pay out. You get enough tokens and all of a sudden its sold out... used to be legit. Beats paying for scratchers but man change the payout system back to what it was a year ago and I will change my rating back to 5 stars. Took a legit app and made it a SCAM or just near damn impossible to get any gift cards. Fun to pass the time but doesn't pay out anymore 🙃"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "Nothing says a nice relaxing idle game like forcing someone to either pay you, or login every two hours to continue earning idle money. Also I'd love if I could just once and not see ten offers to give you more money. Edit: Once the game is closed for two hours you no longer earn any idle cash unless you pay real money for an upgrade. That is where you are forced to login every two hours",
            "It's a great game. Been playing in and off on my tablet for just over a year now. It can get boring at times (hence the 4 stars) but it's a good game. My tablet is beggining to die of natural causes so I thought I'd install it on my phone too. Started off with idle miner on my phone then got hooked to idle factory haha. Its a good game to be able to just picked up and play, and it's a good time killer too :)",
            "I installed the app, and I opened it but theres nothing! Just a black screen.. Then after a while, it just exit out the game. Then I tried it 5 times again.. Still nothing! I dont know if it was my phone or it really was like that but please fix this because I really want to play this game. Hope you reply. Sincerely,Mia.",
            "I really love this game, but can I ask one thing? Because I play Idle Mining too can you change the song in the different zones because 1 song for the whole area is just a killer and very monotonous. Especially in the event factory. Like a cool midevil song or cool space song. It just really kills it to have 1 song for every area.",
            "Honestly, this is a great game and I like it. The app is easy to use and really love the gameplay. I was addicted during the start and later I feel bored and I uninstall it. I rated it 4 stars because this is not your fault, maybe I'm not into clicker game. I just don't want to pull down your guys rating. BUT, there are a lot of people who feel bored after playing this game for days."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

            "I love this game! They send free credits throughout the day. Of course using premium level and 4 cards is the best. But I've gotten bingos off of one card. Really have to try this one 🥰 10/29/29 Grumpy Cat is the best ever room. You definintly have to try it. Win clothing items, dress him up, take pics I share them in my FB story. GRUMPY always makes me smile. Seriously give him a try you'll be glad you did!!",
            "I loved this game, play it everyday sometimes 2 or 3 times but after the update its always crashing on me. I had over 100 chips this morning and every game I tried to play it let me buy the game, start playing then freeze until it comes up game over. Im not playing again till this is fixed - a shame as it would have been a 5 star review last week ☹",
            "Wonderful game. Tired of having credits taken away every single day lately without the benefit of actually getting to play. Frustrated! Looking for new favorite game if support can't fix this issue. 🤬 I reach out to support and all I get is information on how the game works. No refund whatsoever on my credits. What a joke.",
            "Great game for bingo lovers, I play every morning with my cup of coffee and some Bingo Bash, love the game but getting annoyed with the gifts every night it comes thru get your gift and you hit the icon and no free surprise its been going on for weeks now, i play every day and do spend a good bit of money on chips, please tske a look or fix or I'll have to lower from 5 stars, i do love the game but very annoying",
            "I find it boring now. I love playing mini games as Rapid bingo or Grand tour. I always loose all my chips in rapid bingo. Very few times I won otherwise always loose chips.From last 6 months playing Grand tour but not won 300 chips reward. So stop playing that also. I find your team is only interested who put money. Those who play with free chips, your team don't bother. Now I feel depressed while playing this game, while loosing the chips. Earlier this game was my favorite."

            "When i played it its seem kinda normal but laggy and after i played 3 times when the times is up the numbers change into symbol and it teleported me to play store to the app and all the letters and numbers turn to symbols it kinda seem it glitch!!! Do not. Down load this im W@RNINg _U do NOT down loa d eror..... PLE@$E D0N%OT DOWN LO+D THI$!!,...erro,.e.r.....,..",
            "A fun game... If you LOVE lagging and millions of adverts. And if you only want to use it once. I opened it on the 2nd time amd waddya know? An error has occored. Honestly. Don't waste your time, get a different game. :)"

Awesome to kill time, but the forced ads after just about every single round is a real buzz kill, especially when its after dying instantly to an AI spawned with really fast 1-shot projectiles killing the instant you spawn in. Not only do they spawn with unbeatable set ups sometimes, they have up to 6,000HP is as high as I've noticed. I have 717HP, still a 1-shot with anything let alone this. Update brought literally changes whatsoever. Game is more frustration than entertainment.",

When you are playing the game and you are near The spikes but not even close to them to where they should hurt you, they decrease your damage anyway That is something that needs to be fixed. Also, please bring back death Battle, I'm not even sure why you got rid of it in the first place It was actually a good feature to this game!",

Previously, a homeless person lived here, so there was some furniture in the room, and the walls were partially covered with old, worn wallpaper, behind which you could sometimes hear the rustling of insects. Waking up completely, Catherine stretched like a cat and sat on the mattress. She didn't know what will she do today. Her thirst for blood, which she sometimes had, was not very disturbing to her now. Last night she went hunting, and now she could live in peace for the next few days. Turning slightly to the left, she noticed that now she was not alone in the room - a cat was sitting next to her, intently turning her eyes on Catherine. Catherine loved cats, more than anyone in this world, she trusted them. There were many of them in her life, and her life has already stretched for almost five hundred years. Catherine has long ceased to give them names, because if you give the cat a name, you grow attached, and the harder it will be to lose them later.

            "The story's good. I'll recommend playing this. But TBH? I was expecting better, the first game they came up with, '13 days of life' was far better, 'Someday' wasn't bad either, but the quality of stories they came up with is much decreased since last. I was waiting for this game for 2 yrs now, and i deleted it in middle. I'm very disappointed.",
            "I really like point and click adventures and this seems to fit nicely into that category. Graphics aren't great but it gives it a retro feel. Unfortunately, I can't play it! The screen is too dark, and even turning up my brightness doesn't help much. Plus doing that kills my tabs battery. Can you add like a gamma adjustment to the settings? Please? I'd like to play your game...",
            "Amazing experience, anyone reading should give it 15 minutes to try yourself. Barely missing 5* for the following reasons: the learning curve with control was hard, but got around well. Colour palette is great, and dark UI is ok, you can always increase backlight. More annoying was animation when interacting with animals (no spoilers, right?), picking smth 113 was terrible to see that again. Again, you don't have to. But worst part were locked doors that you couldn't open until certain moment",
            "The story is the most interesting part of this game, but not much care went into the game itself. Catherine is the slowest character I have ever seen and many parts of the game have you back tracking to the city where Catherine somehow loses the ability to run. In the end a game that should take 1 hour max will probably end up taking 5 hours of your life to finish.",
            "nice, but buggy. playing right along, and finally felt like progress was being made. then it gets stuck on a loading screen for no reason whatsoever. uninstall/reinstall--same loading screen. otherwise, neat game with old school computer game style roleplay story, which you solve puzzles to complete. i like all of the focus on cats."

However at later levels you're forced to grind for a long time to get what you need to upgrade your base and the zombie difficulty begins getting higher than your survivors can seem to upgrade. Also, the zombie hunt rarely drops anything good, and you can't seem to unlock Rosie, the bow ladh.",
            "I like the controls, graphics and the interesting raiding mechanic with the unique graphic style with gory, explosive gameplay that some other zombie games don't utilize. However, there are too many ads and pop up for a game that has very repetitive gameplay that after so many raids grows boring and takes a long time to progress to the point where you need to watch 60 second ads to get the items you need on top of all the other annoying pop ups. It has potential.",

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Fun, ad optional , game to play Sometimes ads don't work or don't give buff, but sometimes it gives the ad buff, then gives it again, so when I giving my employee of the day more time, it became 32 hours But fun time waster Edit: BUT sometimes it says it going give you one thing from a flying gift, but then it doesn't give it to you, so when that's fixed, it will be a five star rating again",
            "This game is really good for using time when you have nothing to do and is generally a very fun game. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because, I was saving up 15 dollars (in game) to buy the coin rain and once I got the 15 needed it stopped me from buying it.",
            "This is a pretty good idle game. You can play it entirely without an internet connection and it doesn't shove microtransactions in your face every 5 seconds. I definitely recommend this game if you like idle games.",
            "I don't have all the badges in the game but it is pretty good not going to lie I got all the factories and I got to the millions of the Mondays and I got a couple robots I got like 18 and right now I got the trophy my first Trophy and recent at the game I'll see you later guys now time for me to work doing this"

The strong players always attack the weakest player, there are already enough strong player in every city so there is no chance to grow up free or with small amount of money. I am playing this game more than 6 months and without paying i can't grow up. Don't waste your money. This games is only for those who can invest thousands of €€€€$$$$",
            "I liked the game at first, but I started having a bug in my game that hinders me from playing. I have invested alot in this game, and I thought it was going to be great. Instead, I have not heard a response from the company to help resolve my issue. I tried contacting through the game, email, Facebook, and even called a phone number that is disconnected. BEWARE DO NOT SPEND MONEY, BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET HELP IF YOU CAN'T PLAY BECAUSE OF A GLITCH!!!!!",
            "I really like this game. But there are more problems. people are seen able to attack people and their truce don't expire. With every update, the game lags, then freezes before minimizing itself now. And 99% of the personal event rewards are not worth doing! Fragments are a joke when won. Especially for the yellow ones. And the buyable packs need a lot more in them to be worth their amount. City Chat is still not monitored! Do something!!!!",
            "I have played games similar to this but i gotta say i like the mafia thing. The game is fun by itself with the story line and evrything. But it is a little more fun when other people participate in the clan. But it defitately keeps my mind busy when its trying to run wild. Love the game though, lots of rewards also!",
            "I just installed the game maybe half hour ago, after 4 \"error\" during the install. Middle of playing (still tutorial part) it randomly stopped and pops up that it was updating at stuck at 40% for 10 mins. Closed it, assuming my phone was being dumb and now i have not been able to get back in the game. I get a black screen that keeps minimizing and refuses to play :( i have family who play the game so was really hoping to play, but this much bs already is not comforting start!"

            "The app is great. My only issue comes with jobs not updating if the position is still available. Maybe a notification can be sent via email to the managers of the establishment. Or maybe add an option where it says dates when job was posted. It shows when but you can't categorize it in the search engine. But other than that great app and got me plenty of jobs in the past.",
            "App use to be great, but for some reason it's not working like it use to on my Android phone. I uninstalled and re-installed the App, but it didn't fix my issue. My issue being that when i try to click on a job ad or any of my messages, the App just sends me to a blank white screen and i have let that screen sit while connected to wifi, as well as not connected.. and nothing changes. Always sends me to a blank screen.",
            "Job searching is difficult because it displays jobs that are not related to the search. It is annoying and can be unreliable since it will also displays jobs that you previously searched and applied or visited. It is fine to try your luck. Edit: It has been over a year and this app has not help one bit. I used another website (Career Builder), and I have gotten four interviews in the past two weeks. Now I have a job that suits me. I highly recommend going there instead of using this garbage.",
            "For an app designed to help you find a job, it is not very intuitive. Filling in forms is probably the most frustrating part due to the fact that the app is NOT always formatted to mobile. The automatic information extraction from uploaded resumes is not bad, but when it comes to work experience it always needs fixing. Often, I will get half way through correcting the information, and then have to restart because I hit the wrong button swiping back and forth to read what I typed in the text box.",
            "It's a good App, but I think all the assessments when applying for jobs should be limited to just a few every month, not almost every time you apply for a job! Employers should utilize those questions during the interview process. Sometimes...its just enough to get through the application process, but then you have to do all these assessments too; sometimes employers want more than one assessment! Indeed...you're great, but cut those back some, it's too much!"

It'll click on an article when I try to swipe up to hit the home button. Then it takes ten years to finally close out the unwanted redirection. I'm seriously considering switching services because of this god awful pop up annoyance.",

But yaa, in Clash of Clans we can upgrade our town hall to level 12 only but in Throne Rush we can upgrade our castle 18 level and more. I have given this two stars because the game have no system gain Diamonds you can only get diamonds by buying them!! Which is not good at all",

Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",
            "This games was alot of fun until I found out that all it takes is one glitch to cause you to lose everything. I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",

But if you are a newbie, there are things need to consider. > The intro loading is a bit longer than usual game. > The game mechanics is based in real life situation so it is a bit hard.

            "I like this game alot! Its very fun to make vlogs and other stuff. I got this app a couple days ago and I already am starting to love it! There is an issue with the ads but that doesn't really bother me alot I don't find it a problem.. you can create vlogs, dress your avatar up, make vlogs, and more! Other than the ads this game is amazing. The way that you can comment on peoples vlogs/videos is AMAZING! Its really fun how you get 10,000 subs in one day. I hope the future updates are good too!",
            "I love this game! Its amazing and has so many things that are cool! One thing that would be better is maybe if u could comment on other peoples videos just like in real life!! Other thann that there is a really good game that every one should install as soon as possible! Make sure that u dont have ads though because there are a lot of them! Makers if your reading this please cut back on all the ads they are kinda annoying and ridiculous how many there are! But overall its a really AMAZING game!!",
            "I love this game! I would give it 5 stars but there is a lot of tapping and the more videos you make the longer it lakes to make them. I wish you could comment on other people's videos and comments. You should make it so you can interact with different objects like the swimming pool and basketball hoop and maybe even control what you are doing in the videos. Like you say your going to do sports as the topic and then you try and shoot hoops for the video. I do recommend this game, it's fun!",
            "Amazing game! I love playing it. I would recommend it, has fun rewards, you can watch a stream, etc. But one thing that bugs me is when I got more then 5,000 subscribers, the box thing didn't unlock. Please fix it and I will get a 5 star rating for you.",
            "It's a pretty fun game I've been looking for something like this for a while. The reason for three stars is bc to post a video all you do is just pick a topic and done. Like you can only TALK about something not like do a challenge. I wanted to do a WoF video but you can't do that."

To make things worse, I can't always find the article I was reading again. Annoying. Update...Still happening. Still annoyed.",
            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",
            "I've been using News break for about a year now, and it's been informative and accurate in relating the news. I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

            "This app was good a couple years ago. But in the last couple years it has gotten worse and worse. It's always trying to sync and never does. This app needs to be redone. I like that I don't have to listen to every single message. I can visually see who the message is from. I like being able to erase certain messages without having to listen to them every time. This could be a great app if you would FIX the problems. Seems like everyone has the same issues. I've been with metro for about 10yrs.",
            "Keeps sending me messages that say the app is \"running\" and the app will not synchronize properly. VERY ANNOYING. Metropcs can't figure it out. Tried getting them to fix the problem three times but they don't know how to do it!!! Will probably have to uninstall the app, lose all of my archived messages and pic's and reinstall to see what happens. Also, NEVER set your permissions to ALL! Doing so will let messenger change your contact list, phone call information, distributes private info also!!",
            "I n hoping this update haz fixed all its snags, it wont sync, it leaves a tickertsape note acrossmy phobe staging it \" keeps trying to connect to uou ,but cant get thru\"! Now i tried getting on the app on my phone but after setting my new passcode per the apps request , and using my phones last 4 numbers like suggested by app! Then it wouldnt accept the phones numbers, i have to call my phone to get into my VM\"s so the app really is worthless! Lets jooe it has been fixed or im dropping it!",
            "I used to be able to delete old VM's, multiple at a time. I don't have to listen to them but I have to click on each one individually and delete it. Why can I no longer select more than one and delete messages I know I don't need to listen to?",
            "Always been great visual voicemail. Where can I locate the 2020 update version? I received a text message from Metro to get the update. Thank you. Susanne"

            "I loved playing the game. Great and fun time waisted. But for some reason my time moves faster than it seems it should, which means my half my prisoners end up mad because there wasn't enough time to eat either because they weren't able to get in quick enough or they weren't able to use the exercise yard long enough or even get to shower because they didn't leave the last place quick enough. Causing more riots. No option to contact makers in game either.",
            "Its fun, and the most unique and diffuclt tycoon games I have ever played. There are new challenges, and macanics, It is by far one of my most favorite moble games. Now, there is 1 things that, dont ruin the game, but just annoy me a little. The first is that if you stop playing, your prison is almost geunteed to get a righit. You can stop this though by buying a manager with real money, and I know it sopports the game, but it just annoys me. Overal though, this is a fun game, and I recomend it.",
            "Good game. Once you complete all rewards in a prison there should be a reset to play again or upgrade to make the level a little more challenging. The alien invasion level requires gems but if there is no way to earn them you have to buy them and i am not doing that. Plus there is no reason to go back to a prison once its completed. The game becomes finite at that point.",
            "Okay! This game is fun! I have splurged some $$ into it. I wish some things would change. 1.When the line is forming every single prisoner gets to eat. What is the point of being able to make all this food if not every prisoner gets it. Not realistic. 2. I wish I could as the person running the prison get to rearrange the schedule of when they get to do hourly activities. 3. Same with bathroom situation as the lunchroom the prisoners give up and not clean themselves. Wouldn't actually happen. 😊",
            "So, this game has great potential, however, my 3⭐ are due to their recent event: \"Alien Invasion\". Like other idle tycoon games, it is ad heavy. Unlike other tycoon games, that use 15-30 sec ads, this game continuously shows \"ads\" from unknown web mags that take nearly a minute to go through. The Alien Invasion event has caused the game to become glitchy, sometimes declining to give the bonus for watching the ads. Also, jumping from one prison to another, can cause the ad bonus to reset entirely"

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "I have loved this game and the play. But in the recent update and event, this has been a monumental failure. The new ranking system of pvp makes it more complicated to play with clan mates and it hasn't done anything to improve matchups. The new horde event with the collecting cards to gather coins to spend on weapons, heroes, and gear is just so complicated and frustrating. Why change something that worked for so long? The old way of milestones is so much better. Please go back to the old ways!",
            "Still a problem with PVP match ups!!!! Still too many cheaters, hackers and aim bots. And the match up algorithm is still a joke. Keep having to go against players with way more power. If you're on a win streak, magically you're going to have to face said cheaters, hackers and aim bots to knock your ranking back down. Been playing for almost 2 years and they still won't really fix this problem. I have too much money invested in this game to delete it. Oh well. Be warned.",
            "The new matchmaking system is just as terrible as the one before it. I have been playing the PVP since they introduced it and I have not gone beyond ranking 19 as I am constantly matched up against opponents far better than me, so nothing has changed besides the developers saying they have addressed an issue that so many gamers were unhappy with. And this new issue will take them years to sort out just like before. Steer clear of this game unless you are willing to spend lots of money.",
            "Great graphics good game except for the greedy pay to play system. This game also seem to have way too many server issues. Sometimes while I'm in the process of making a purchase it tells me I have been awarded the resources but it didn't actually happen. The devs will say it was added to my account when clearly it isn't. The match making system puts you up against players way more powerful than you are and you will often have to play against lame hackers that will not play fair.",
            "PVP is full of cheaters with hack codes, terrible system. Their servers lose connection nearly every day, multiple times, in the middle of a match causing you to lose. Extremely frustrating! If you love a game that the developers aim to beg for your wallet to get anything good to compete, well this game is for you!"

            "Really fun game. Huge variety of units to buy. Love the offline earnings aspect of the game, which helps offset the huge cost of leveling them up. Each stage last under 5 minutes so you can rapidly advance through stages. Although it can be difficult, especially boss stages. Well worth a download.",
            "Whoever thought of the concept of Towerlands, certainly knew how to think outside the box. An extremely unique concept and gameplay style. Haven't had the crashing issues other players have experienced (Phone: Samsung S9, Samsung A5). The English translations are oddly done, but they have a unique charm to them that I've grown to appreciate. Ads aren't intrusive, and you can easily save up gold while not playing. Premium transactions are way overpriced; I'm definitely willing to pay otherwise.",
            "Had to edit my rating, the game is currently unplayable. Try to load it and if I'm lucky enough to have the game load once I click to to anywhere it immediately crashes. I have sent crash report explained in detail what has happened. Hope this gets fixed soon, I do enjoy the game but haven't been able to log in for many days now.",
            "You beat wave 4000 and the game crashes, the game shows you are on 4001 but you are still on 4000 and cannot beat it, since it will alwaya crash. It happens for everyone who is that far. I will cancel my membership, this is the worst bugged game I've seen so far. The rankings are bugged since the beginning and the devs do nothing...",
            "I've loved the game so far but for the past three days I have not been able to launch the game past the loading screen. It sort of bugs out and goes back to my phones home screen. Any answers to when this could be fixed so I can continue?? Edit: has been working great, love the game 🙏🏻"

I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

            "Would be 5 but developer wanted feedback. Its a recording app. Only way to screw it up is to cram it with ads and push for feedback. Either way. Guess it's nice to get a pat on the back every now and then. And they do deserve it. It's a pretty good app with minimal ad interruption. So if you need to record something download the app. And to the creator. Thanks",
            "Firstly, I don't know why people give this app less than 4stars. Something is really wrong with them . This voice recorder is overall a very good app. The best feature I think it has is the voice editor. It is a blessing for me because my phone's voice recorder is just bollocks.... thats ittt !! So yes...well done.",
            "This is a great app I have enjoyed using. It provides clear recording sound, allows you to mix background sounds with the lead recording, you can trim your recordings add introduce a different voice to your original track. Your can do all these and many on a phone... It's a great thing that I recommend. If there's a PC version please send me the link to download, if there isn't then I suggest the developer should his/her way to get me one. The video recorder from you will be great too. Bravo!",
            "Love the app! Very good at picking up audio (sometimes even too good, but that can be changed in mixing). Would rate 6 stars if it had built-in filters that change the sound. But I get that this is a recording app and I shouldn't expect or even hope for that, so I will still rate 5 stars. Also, make it so the app doesn't fall asleep. I have a fingerprint phone, so it hears the vibration it makes. Again, a spectacular app. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good sound.",
            "Very easy to use. Recording and playback functions are upfront. The ability to share to email and other methods is very easy. Minimal ads and for a free to use product, it was worth it to watch a commercial here and there. Overall, I would recommend this app if you need a simple option to record a message or note or in my case a briefing that I had to do."

            "Best. App. EVER!! Its amazing! Sure you cant download as many songs as you want, but they are just making buisness! Furthermore, its just great and I am listining to it as I am writing this. I can't think of a better app, spotify is way too expensive as I am a kid. But this here is just an amazing legend. It gets my 5 stars. (It deserves infinite stars though)",
            "I really hate the fact that you know have to upgrade to premium to download as much songs as you want, it really sucks, I've had this app since 2017 when you didn't have to be premium, kinda sucks now you have a limited amount of songs you can download. Also adds are getting worse and worse, need to fix that",
            "audiomack is usually a 5star App ...However, this new upgrade which only allows you to download a certain amount of premiums downloads before forcing an upgrade .... which once was free causing my rating to be as is... i am a long time customer and once im able to download an unlimited amount of download w\\o seeing certain songs being characterized as premiums my rating will increase significantly!!!!!",
            "If I'm being honest. Don't understand the complaints. The app devs need the money that they get for premium, limiting the offline Playlist to 20 isn't bad because you can still have an online one. You just need internet to play the songs and most people have data so I don't see the big deal. The app is good, you find new artist, remix and really anything you want. The staff is monitoring the app constantly from what I've seen and overall just works as a good music streaming app.",
            "First. Anybody on this app that is looking for a Apple music replacement is lame; thats why excluscivity has a fee. Second, if you use Live Mixtapes but are tired of the lack of currensy, this is the type of release access you need. Finally, I use more Audiomack than the LiveMixtapes App, the Apple Music app, because apple is...corporate. Eventually they'll pick it up but Audiomack to me is still getting the links to the streets. Like that Zayetoven release, i cant find it anywhere. Thank you."

            "Sicko app for beginners in the game. It keeps getting better too. Its not too complicated, if i wanted to do it in the studio, I would. I'd have to pay thousands of dollars too! Squash that, this is that new normal, that next paradigm. So let me drop a dime, in the phone(cellular). I made this song in one night, during a fight, between me and my wife. I didn't have any time, but it came out sublime, wife'ys calling it a crime, gold it glows, but silver it shines, 9 times. Outta ten..zen",
            "This app rewards people for copying and singing over other artists vocals. It also rewards the same 10 - 15 people every week. Admin don't reply to queries and they also don't stick to the rules. The same rules they expect their users to stick to. If you make your own cover art and mix your own tracks Its like you're less likely to be rewarded. They also judge tracks even tho they don't make music which means they don't even know what it takes to make tracks.",
            "Not bad! I like the concept of the app and it's pretty dope. Wish there were more functions. I've been waiting to relaunch my YouTube channel and music too so this was a pretty good idea to start networking. Try it out. They have samples and demos and easy to use",
            "I love this app but right now its giving me a hard time trying to use special features like I usually would it does not even let me see the words at the bottom to apply it... whats going on with the app??? And yes I am a Suscribed member for the year.",
            "The app is decent, still room for improvement though. How about adding a info bar so the producers can give details about the song structure, bpm, and instrumental etc? I have been wanting to write songs for the longest, but without that info i cannot do it."

Also literally no ads, unless you choose to watch an ad to speed up the already fast tasks! So I have nothing bad to say about it! Nice job Pewds!",
            "This is from when i first played it. It is great and fun and i love it, but had to uninstall it bcs of problems with my storage. Now that i fixed my storage i reinstalled it but to my suprise i cant play. Im stuck im the loading screen where it has the logo of the game and the colorful background. If u can help me plz do",
            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant 😁😉",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

            "Used to be good, but after the recent update you can't collect enough resources to advance the game unless you pay. Edit: the reply from the game rep is innacurate. I had plenty of resources, almost enough to upgrade and the next day, everything was gone and have never been able to save any resources to play the game, let alone make the game easier.",
            "I was enjoying it but I'm tired of always being lowest might in arena. Everytime I upgrade drastically, magically when I join another arena match, everyone else doubles and triples my might. I literally took all my gear off and my might was 35k and everyone in that room were 100 to 300k, I waited for rounds to end and equipped my gear which had me at 326K and then everyone was 550k to 725k. Complete bs. Yep, definitely a money grab game.",
            "Odds of winning items and the rewards given are getting poorer as the GREED for money grows. I play but have lost interest. I quit spending hundreds to get everything. If money is no object you will enjoy. Support services are the worst. Robots with no helpful info...just scripted responses. . I lowered my review for the lame scripted response you added to my comment. It doesnt work.",
            "1. The game glitches way too much 2. The game crashes every 20 - 30 minutes while playing it 3. Its a pay to win game 4. Its so slow loading and loading 5. The game sucks U should have a 2builders from the start and the limit of 5builders, And have a competetive fight only your level can fight you, because i play it then i challenge some raids, after it resets there is a 1.5m powered guy And I only have 200k power, how am i supossed to beat that?!",
            "Mobile Crusader kings meets building combat games like SoS. The gameplay is a mix of those two, really grindy and very much aimed toward wallet warriors. Can still progress f2p but really slowly. My game experience is hindered by long loading times and lag, didn't matter if I used my phone or gaming rig with bluestacks was still slow. Takes forever to load in and any pvp. Frequently, my commands aren't even done due to lag."

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "This game is actually very fun to play. The controls are prettyty easy to understand and it is perfect for people who wants to play a strategy game while also thinking of how to manage their movements and timing. Just one thing. I suggest a new trap to be added into the game. Maybe a yellow guard where it moves diagonally instead. Overall, exelent game. 5 stars!",
            "As a strategy maze game, it's fun, but only when actual human beings design the mazes themselves. There are several dungeons/mazes that were clearly not conceived by a real person, & there's no way to report this. Also, the game forces you to take a three hour \"time-out\" if it thinks you've been playing too much. There's absolutely no warning, no countdown clock, no \"five minutes to go, wrap it up\", nothing. AND you only get 45 minutes of protection after being raided. Other games give 16 hours.",
            "I put 3 becuz I have new ideas to make this game perfect... I wish, u can control the thief on ur own and I wish there's more traps so it's more challenging, and the last is, I wish I can edit the ground like an obstacle course so it would be amazing. and that is all, bc that was i thinking when I installing the game but it wasn't... :( I still play it tho, I just want some changes to the game. I was going to put it 5 but I put 3... So I really wish u can change the game a little bit.",
            "Was fun at first, but you can tell where people fudged their dungeons to always win. Also the fact that you can't see that some people have it already a sliver of a chance to win before you start. It's kinda a waste of keys. Idk how they get it that small but I'm seeing why I Uninstalled it a couple years ago. Plus the fact that if you respin you almost never get the gem even if it's a 50/50 chance. I spent was too many trying to get one and it's stupid. I've already spent too much money to try.",
            "whenever you watch adds, it still say watch add to do something even though you already did and you also dont get the award most of the times you watch adds. also it takes forever to save a hard base and to save you have to do it two times in a row"

            "From 5 star app to 1 star, way to go.... When I started using this app it was great. Over time it got more and more bloated, plastered with ads and no longer being able to select the sources. I think this last update is the straw that breaks the camel's back. I do not like the new look at all. I have used this app since it came out but I'm off to find greener pastures, the app has lost everything that made it stand out from any other news portal.",
            "Keeps going downhill. This used to be the best news app out there. Now all the forced adds you can't close until timer runs down, make it almost unusable. You already mix adds in with articles then force MORE ADDS on top of that..RIDICULOUS! Suggestion you wanted: Don't add a timers to adds. That just pisses people off. Don't act like this is an acceptable alternative to a subscription fee. Good luck trying to charge one to view other news source's articles.",
            "Love this app. Absolutely hate the new format of the top news tab.Originally I took off just 2 stars, but it just bugs.me so much I hate it. Wish they would put it back the way it was or have the option. ******EDIT****** Rating from 1 to 5 stars. the top news tab had changed so that pictures for each story were large and I could only have 1 headline on screen at a time.So I had to scroll a lot just to scim through.They have put it back to they way it was before! Mostly. Ads are big but thats OK",
            "The ads are minimal (make your money, booboo) But I originally downloaded the app because I thought it cast a wide net of views, but it feels like its just giving me more of what I regularly click on. Still, I get enough to feel tired of the world, which is really all I want from a news app anyway. Good job, persons.",
            "Seems to be excellent... Since my original review, some of the news options come out of left field (crazy). Also when reviewing articles, nonsense symbols show up in the body of text, sometimes making it unreadable. e.g. \"eadquartersâ€™â€œTrump Store,â€�\" So, lose a star on the rating scale."

And if you don't use the boost you lose it. Only thing I am sorry for is spending money on here. Paid to get no ads. All rewards and bonuses have ads.",
            "Took away thousands of dollars from league score. Lots of glitches. Says videos available for reward buy then says not available. Did not give me credit for a big auction that I used kick outs on. Game glitches continue. Often says I didn't watch full video. Now special lockers don't have the items guaranteed. A month later still no better. A month later, just happened again",
            "I cannot give this game 5 stars since you are obliged to watch a ridiculous amount of them. In addition, getting VIP doesn't give any daily gold and you still need to watch ads to get powerups and other things. They want you to spend money AND watch ads which is unfortunate. Lastly, sometimes the computer will over bid all rooms so you cannot progress. In addition, it's almost impossible to win big as it seems the computer will bid close to its worth. Other than those issues, this game is fun.",
            "The energy tokens you need to play the game are so slow to arrive, it's painful. It's also weird that the game builds in something to stop folk from playing. Edit: I've uninstalled it just one day later. The ads were annoying enough but sometimes when you try to close them the game crashes and you lose precious tokens it's simply not bearable. I swear I spent much longer watching ads than I did playing the game. Oh, and a couple of screens you can't close so you have to quit losing more tokens.",
            "I love the game but it's just not updating because I'm on level 43 and it keeps saying that the new levels are coming soon and it's been 3 months!! Great game but we can't get any further than level 43, frustrating that it says coming soon !!! Update again today and it's still stuck on locker 42??? Please sort this out ive been waiting ages to progress in the game"

            "i like the idea and how if it gets too hard theres a way out without having to pay any money. controls are a little wonky for me sometimes but im starting to get it to work. the only thing i want is more stuff to do. more cars, more things we can do with the cars, maybe more customization options. oh and maybe a short tutorial. other than just wanting more, i really like this game. and there are some ads but it doesnt get super annoying.",
            "Finally a game that does advertisements right, it doesn't spam you with them from minute to minute and the gameplay is quite enjoyable, the accuracy of the parts click zone could be a bit improved (sometimes I have to click a part multiple times to disassemble it because it thinks I want to take another part off the car) but otherwise great game and a real time killer.",
            "This game was and still is so much fun and I hope you guys expand it even more, the only thing I would like to say is we need different engine types in game I like working on four cylinders but I like working on v engine the most, so if you all can put different engine types in the game I would be so happy and grateful I get to play such a kick-ass game.",
            "The game is good. Kindly add a junkyard as well, Where we can search for parts or vehicles or engines. And kindly think of adding a personal project where we will be able to built our own personal vehicle with any engine or any type of body. Kind of like a mix and match. Thank you",
            "If you are a petrolhead who has grown up with soviet era cars, you'll enjoy this game. Simple gameplay but hard to master. It has ads but never intrusive. Really hoping for an update that would add tuning options for the van. If there was a DLC adding more content to this game, I'd pay money for it."

Why since its unlimited. Then you videos begin to wind. Then in the middle of a video, it leaves the site and goes back to the home page. Im going back aa soon as possible to verizon. The have the best service. My daughter passed, and our verizon account was in her name. She added me. Metro does not have good service.",
            "I've been with metro for about 2 1/2 years . I have only had two real complaints one was so unjust but eventually got corrected . The other continues today . I pay for unlimited talk and text and data . I'm sure I am not the only one with this problem , but every month when I pay my bill my phone is fast , accurate , and what is expected . Then after about a week I start experienceing major buffering and an otherwise frustrating time researching anything on the internet ! I've actually increased",
            "My main problem with this app is that you can't log in with Wi-Fi, it MUST be through data. So you can only imagine how annoying that was when having signal trouble or the one time the bill was paid a day late.. I get that it's for safety reasons, but glitches occur often enough already with this app, so it's double the pain. Handy on occasion but tends to fail out when you're in a pinch. Also whenever I try to call metro this app will pop open instead, not allowing me to make any of the calls.",
            "Your service is unacceptable . When I try to contact your company by calling from my phone through this app which is the only option I am given, my phone will not connect to you. And if by chance this service makes a connection and I finally get an agent the call is dropped everytime. My issue is never resolved. I am left in a worse position than I was when I started. Being frustrated and upset. I have tried several times with nothing. Not happy a happy customer.",
            "I just read a review about someone saying they have unlimited data it slows down. Depending on your plan your speed will slow down. You still get unlimited data but at a slower speed. You need to have the $60 a month plan to get unlimited 4g or 5g depe depending on the phone. Connect to wifi whenever possible to save your data"

            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

            "Enjoying playing the game. It's so addicting I'm going to have to set a timer. I really like the game but I continually get a network error then the game reloads. With the help of Emma's Adventures tech I no longer have problems. I unplugged my router for about three minutes then plugged it back in. After getting back online, everything is running smoothly. In the future, I'll unplug and see if thar fixes the problem before driving the tech crazy with all my messages to them for help.",
            "I like the challenges and how you build up your town the way you want it . I have been playing this game for a while now and still like it but 2 major issues . The ships that come in you should have the same option as the train to let it go even if you haven't filled it . The guild is not great most of the time its too hard to help people compared to other games such as township in that game being part of a guild is what makes the game fantastic. a few changes would make it fun and enjoyable.",
            "So far the best game I have played from play store. I have not spent any money. I am level 53. They always add more content to keep playing. Not everyone will like this game because we are all different. Most people will find it just fine. It is not a pay to play game but if you like it...you can support the developers by buying things if you wish to. I have received no compensation for this review nor do I want it. This is a great game!",
            "Very slow. Not able to advance as quick as I would like to. Stuck on home, going around the crops and animals, since started. Unable to go to other areas without getting stuck. !!!!! Has improved a lot. / Hate it when it goes off while playing at a good moment..... One problem is as I am working on this game, it switches off. So frustrating 😡 . How long will I have to put up with this?",
            "I really like this game but the further you progress in the game, the more energy points it takes to do anything. You spend all your time filling orders just to kill time until you have enough energy to actually play the levels. And then you only have enough energy to clear a bush or two and then wait for an hour. Clear a bush, wait an hour. It becomes far too tedious to want to continue."

Original Review: Used to work great, but lately it has all kinds of bugs whether it suddenly decides it won't accept my payment method anymore or errors out when I try to place an order. It freezes and often forgets to clear my order bag after I've successfully picked up an order. So many headaches lately, I don't know what went wrong. Ued to love this app.",
            "Constantly buggy and glitches. I've used it successfully but it typically requires constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the app or religiously clearing your cache. The deals screen often says you've already used a deal and have to wait an hour even when you haven't ordered in weeks. Overall, a frustrating experience for something that should be a convenience.",
            "Updated 10/2020: I've done everything including uninstalling and re installing. The app doesn't work at all. love this app when it actually works. More than half of the time, I can't pull anything up on it, or it is frozen and nothing on it will work. \"Connectivity issues\" is what it stated. Those issues are not with my phone, because i have service and wifi. Please fix!!!! It's pretty hard to use the app while there when I can't even get in to it.",
            "Fantastic app, works every time. Orders being automatically submitted and requiring \"reopening\" every time I switch apps is annoying but no big deal. One of the best developed fast food pre-order apps. The restaurants, maybe 1.5 star. They must be hiring illiterates, or they glance at the screen and throw in guesses for anything forgotten. The \"hot&spicy\" chicken patty isn't very spicy going down but DON'T LET IT BACK UP. Seems it turns into the fire of hades in your guts. Omg I cried, no joke.",
            "Well, a couple years later, new phone, different Android version, still freezing on the opening screen. so unreliable (CLEARING CACHE DOES NOTHING!) - your food isn't that great that your app should be so problematic. Business 101 - don't make it difficult for people to do business with you. BK works great EVERY time - BYE!"

            "Ever since the update it made it worse. It rings again, that's good. Problem is, people can't hear me but I can hear them. I have to use LINE for the time being until it gets fixed. Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. 👍",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

That was a few hours ago ive come back and now some of the songs i made are gone (i think the app updated) which is really disapointing because i really liked some of those if you could get the songs i lost back then my rating will change to 5 stars",
            "This app has alot of cool updates but I can't do any of the songs. It says it can't play. But 1 day I used the app. And it finally work!!! But when I save the song I sang on rap mode. I can't even hear my voice singing the vibe. it kind of sucks. So I give it a review",

I typed it in right. It pretty frustrating when you need a ride and can't even access your lyft account for a ride. This has been going of for 2 years now.",
            "Up until tonight Ive loved the app, but as of tonight it charges me for the ride but after I go and order it it just goes back to the select destination screen it doesn't look for a car then it tells me I found a car and be ready in 18 minutes but there's no trace of it inside the app I don't know what's going on right now, I'm very disappointed and kind of stranded not because of this possibly unless this guy just shows up mysteriously in 18 minutes I have no clue if he's going to or not",
            "I have had an account for years but have not used it since 2015. I moved to a new state recently and had re-download lyft and tried to attach my payment methods. I tried to attach every option that is offered and the app wouldn't let me. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled several times. There's is no proper customer service set up. I finally found a number that would keep me on hold then eventually hang up. This is why I prefer uber, I never have these problems with them.",
            "Changed my address a week before downloading. My card didnt match my new address when adding it yet. Understandable. But now that my address is up to date, i still have to use a completely different card. I contacted support who told me my card wasnt working or they dont accept it _. I tried explaining it was my address, they sent me to a link that told me I need to use a new card. Its just very frustdrating. I gave it two stars because the drivers are always awesome and the prices are fair.",
            "Terrible. Added my credit card a day prior and thought it was set to go. Now I request a ride and they want a second credit card that has matching address, provided this unnecessary info and rejected because could not validate, your problem not mine. Dishonest, unreliable, do not use if your ride is a necessity. Unbelievable. 0 stars if I could"

Hate using this app unless it's completely my last resort!",

Some guys are patronizing themselves as customer care representatives all they do is hack your bank accounts and all your hard earned money is gone. The money sent to me can't be accessed too for the past 2 weeks. I don't encourage anyone to download this app",

The app took a picture on its own of back side as i was moving my id arpund for 30 min annoyed. And then it only took when i put super close, taking only an 8th of whole back side, twice!"

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "I've played this for about a year. It's very addictive. Only reason I will not give 5 stars is because of the adverts. Although this game does not thrust adverts at you after every level like some games do, you can optionally watch an advert to get a boost. Only problem is with some adverts they start forcing you to install another app/game, or sometimes the adverts freeze, or sometimes they cause the game to restart, they have even caused the phone to reboot. This is not good.",
            "Been playing this game for a couple of years now. I like how the daily rewards don't reset if you miss a day. I love that there is always something to do. Standard mines, event mines and the mainland. It would be nice if the prestige for the standard mines wasn't so expensive. I've only managed to prestige 2 mines in 2 years although I do spend most of my time on the event mines to be fair. Nice game to spend some time on. I like how you can upgrade your miners too.",
            "The game is fun enough, but I gave it 1 star for two main reasons. The game has recently started asking me to rate it at _least_ once a day. This is incredibly annoying, but here's your review. The other reason is that I was just offered the \"no-ads\" offer for $15, and coincidentally the game now freezes nearly every time I click on an ad for a boost. I keep having to exit the game, try to watch an ad again and hope maybe it works. I feel like maybe the two things are related. ETA: I did email.",
            "great little clicker, perfect for when you have a few minutes to spare, fast user interface and heaps of things to do, lots of freebies and a steady (if not a little slow) way to make premium credits however some of the in game purchases are fairly expensive, but honestly they're not necessary to progress in the game.",
            "The game is designed to kill time, it does that. Puzzles are my favorite, but when I'm on hold and still have to pay attention to my world this kills the time. Don't expect to be grabbed by how in depth or awesome this game isn't. Just click to fidget. Do I love it, no. Does it work as planned, yup."

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "I loved the game at first I even made it to level 50. However, after months of playing the game investing my time and money it rebooted and made me start over from level 1. They took away my home and Sims family. I was so disappointed. They have since fixed this problem and returned my level and items. I love this game.",
            "Ok. I like this game. But one thing that i really don't like is that they don't notify us of new updates in the game. I would have to go to playstore everytime i suspect there's new updates. Sometimes i would have missed more than a week during an event before i update and i miss good products. So I really hope they would change that and notify us within the game. Otherwise i love it.",
            "I love the game but some things are still quite annoying in it, like the challenges, some are impossible to get unless you make use of real money to purchase sim cash. It think they should make the challenges quite easier to win reward becos some people can't always afford that. I am also hoping to see pets and cars in the game. By the way nice one EA and Maxis",
            "Quite good mobile adaptation of The Sims game. Enjoyable. -- Problem though: My Sim is female but Izzy designed male clothes for me on the first try, and still male on the second try. My starter Fashion Gems all wasted since females can't wear male clothes. Suggestions: 1) make Izzy able to detect the current Sim's gender or allow us to choose. 2) State the requirements of player's name so that we don't have to keep guessing why it gets rejected.",
            "Have all sims in collection. All great only complaint in this game is the loading and the none selling of items in storage.Be good if could add more sims. Over all great game. Am enjoying it. If the situations were resolved i would give a 5 stars. cheers.."

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",
            "One of the Best scary apps in android..but u guys have to do some new challenges or new maps i mean bigger maps ..like if u got 20/20 money u go outside and u keep playing to get a car to run away or somthing like that"

            "4 stars only because planes can back into each other, bump into each other and sometimes go through each other depending on what planes and how many planes are in que. Also, making enough money to expand or upgrade is way too slow. The more I ply, the less I like this game. Getting what you need is really based on how much time you play the game at one time. Two stars now. This game is no longer fun to play. It's a chore.",
            "This game has improved it is still slow going unless you spend real dollars but now the bonus is that every 14 days you get one game dollar so there is the chance to advance even thought it is slow, it is now possible. Bad thing for me is now I am tempted to spend real funds to get to my goals quicker.",
            "I'm glad I didn't spend any money on the game for 2 reasons. 1)it really is not necessary to spend money if you're just a little patient. It does have advertising which you can watch instead of spending on the game. 2)I've got a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus which is an above average smartphone in terms of its capabilities but the game frequently glitches necessitating closing & restarting which is a problem. Worse is that the developers don't acknowledge issues when reported. It's fun & addictive tho",
            "Since the latest update I'm not able to use my own comfort classes, only the free ones in every few hours. There's no possibility to use mine outside these free times. Also hawk planes often get stuck at the end of the runway and I have to close the game to make them go away. Takes an awful long time to collect coins.",
            "I LOVE this game. It is so involved and there is so much going on that once you level up a few times and you've got say 3 ore more planes and a couple of helicopters, you can literally stay busy constantly collecting passengers, money, exp. points etc...... that you can actually \"play\" the game for hours and your eyes and fingers never leave the screen. The special collections are so cool!! The only thing I don't like about it is a cost a lot of coins to upgrade buildings, buy aircraft etc."

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "The game was amazing. But when I hit level 12 it did not let me go to the next level. I played level 12 about 5 times. It only let me play levels 1-12. Then it said that I have to rate the game. When I rated the game, I went to the game to play again. But it said I have to rate but I already did. So I deleted the review and decided to write a really mean review. IF YOU WILL REGET IT. PLEASE DO NOT GET THE GAME.",
            "At first this game was really fun, but then when i finished level 12 it asked me to rate it and there was no \"later\" option as there usually is so i rated the game and when i got back to the game to continue playing, i had to do the level all over again, so i did, and then the same thing happened after i finished the level for the second time. I am so angry. Defenitly deleting the game.",
            "I love this game. Because of quarantine I have a lot of free time and this game helps m kill that time. I love that the ads are somewhat limited. The only thing I don't like is that is makes you watch an ad when you got the help buttun. Would definitely recommend 😉",
            "Really good game. Excellent puzzles to solve 'em swiftly. So many details, so many colors and numbers. That's fine. Grafphic is 4/5, can be better, but that's ok. It is really funny to solve so many puzzles. But actually, there' re too less rooms, only 12. Am waiting for the next upd.",
            "This is game is fun! Why? -because you can use your minds to solve many things and can play this game offline! What do you learn from it? -you learn many ways on life basics especially on how to do something or try to escape something. You learn many things and also this game helps you revise on what you do at school like knowing the numbers on the clock or auditioning number combinations you unlock this draw! You must download this app !"

            "Controls is terrible. The dev didn't even appreciate player palm and finger size. The virtual joy pad simply too close to corner, its ridiculous for my thumb length and palm size. Movements are wierd. The island visit is nice n fun though, but kinda stupid. When u r drifting on a raft in ocean, n found tiny island with intact houses, why even bother to go back to raft n keep drifting again😂🤣. It couldn't stop me from laughing.🤣😂🤣",
            "Edit: I have totally changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because of one very disturbing thing. The new update (12/10/2020) has made my game terrible, when you go on survival, there is no shop icon and the map icon you cannot press anymore. When I go on create, it just has survival section, so that is not right. Developers, please read this review and respond to it because this is a very important message to fix this situation. Thanks.",
            "Interesting but the opening screen does not play, so I select Skip. Game then plays. I have only played for a short time and the game seems to have a lot of potential. I have one problem so far. I keep hearing what sounds like the word HEAVY. Not sure what that means but it is driving me nuts. Does it mean I have too much stuff on the raft and need to increase the size of the raft? Please help as I would like to continue playing.",
            "There is no purpose to this game. I played this game all summer. I built a massive fortress. I collected and crafted THOUSANDS of items. I really wanted more. The new update is a failure. All the developers did was change textures (looks very bad now). No new missions. No new game play. All they did was shrink one island and open a new one. Why add so many unnecessary things? 7 pop up windows to start the game? Very disappointing."

            "I've had this game for ~6 - 7 years (on other phones and google accounts) and it is definitely the best game to ever exist. It's very addictive, and a great game to play when, say, when you're waiting for the bus and so on. Basically just a nice game to have when you are bored, or whatever your reason is.",
            "Back in my day, this game was free and didn't have any forsaken ads in it. But now if you don't wanna be beaten over the head with the same 2 ads, or have them obnoxiously shoved down your throat every 5 seconds, then of course, ya gotta buy it. And I know it's only a dollar, but I don't care, this game is not worth any price to me. And that's the problem I have with a lotta things nowadays. So Dear Corporations, STOP WITH THE ADS ALREADY! WE DON'T CARE ANYMORE! WE JUST WANNA PLAY STUPID GAMES!",
            "Can u plz add bosses?! They'll each have, healthbars, a unique theme song, and different weapons and weaknesses. Speaking of weaknesses, they're either your nose balls, being jumped on, exploding platforms, propeller caps, or other obstacles u find in different words, and each boss only has 1 of those weaknesses. Shields will spawn a lot more frequently, so obviously the boss can't kill u, but they can however make your shield disappear with their weapons!",
            "The game is good and removing ads costs only $1, but it lacks 18:9 support for most newer smartphones. Edit October 19th 2020: Game also will run on low power devices, and is working on my backup Galaxy S3",
            "Best one handed time waster game ever! You're bored but don't want to start any long term game relationship!? Keep it casual. This is the game for you! I still occasionally play it and have had it on my phone for over 5 years!"

            "Used to love this game. Hadn't played in a little while and wanted to play again. Saying the ads are excessive is being kind. The free version didn't used to be like this. It's not even playable anymore and the only way to remove the obnoxious amount of ads is to get the subscription at $2.99/wk. Sadly 'Uninstall' is the best option.",
            "This used to be one of my favorite games. Now they have added a completely excessive amount of ads. After every guess, right or wrong, I get an add. THIS WHOLE GAME HAS JUST BECOME NON-STOP ADDS. I spend more time now watching adds then playing the game. It takes me 3 seconds to make my new guess and type it...but then I get a 45 second long add🤬🤬🤬🤬",
            "I have been playing this a lot lately, it's good fun and addictive. Some of the levels repeat (I just got exact same picture I've had before) but good variety overall. However the addition of ads popping up after guesses is really annoying. I could put up with it for hints or at the end of a level but it's really off-putting now. My other negative would be once you advance in the game you have to scroll all the way down every time. It would be nice to have a way to jump down to where you're at.",
            "An ad after every guess?! What the hell people? I've played this game for quiet a while and have always enjoyed it. Now I'm uninstalling it because that is obnoxious that you feel the need to flood people with ads after every guess. Right or wrong. Doesn't matter. Here's an ad. Oh whats that? Another one? You sure? Its only been one word, but okay. BAM!!!! ANOTHER AD!!!!",
            "Haven't played in a long time and decided to reinstall it. Mad at my self for doing it. There is an ad after each guess making it enjoyable like it use to be. Had to uninstall. Understand having ads but that was way to much."

            "This is a fun and addictive game. However, it's really buggy lately. Customer service is a crapshoot. When I got assigned David Jarryd, he only responded every 24 hours, didn't understand English and either only partly solved the problem or not at all. I made purchases that wouldn't include all of the items. Their response on here is to contact them on FB. I tried that, too. No response. I highly recommend that you avoid this game.",
            "I love it but sometimes lose the connection. But still the best game ever. I love the events please keep them coming would love events every day and maybe make available the chance to win more rolls some how as I always run out. Love playing with my friends and family but can we get more prizes and more options to add more friends and be rewarded for having over 30. Play every day and enjoy everytime so thank you developers for creating an exciting wonderful game x",
            "This game was good. Don't bother buying anything from the store as after you do the game doesnt let you land on good tiles ever! My friend and I are on the exact same board is board appears to work fine and actually allow him to make progress. All I get is rubbish. Fix the game you money hungry fake creators",
            "To be very honest, I really love the game and its addictive too. But I don't like when the level and dice counts increases, the time doesnt decreases because of this it makes less interactive to the game. As it seems the real problem what I'm facing till now. I think you must decrease the time because it makes people uninstall more early. I feel like that but I dint want to do that. I love the game. You should think of this problem.",
            "Overall it's a cute game to play whenever. But, I'm constantly get false notification. Like while im playing every few second, saying my dice cap is full or mini games is ending soon. Literally getting these while I'm actively playing. Im always getting kicked out. I have spent more on this game than I should, I feel like you don't get much for what your buying. Even though I have bought packs, I still haven't got my last card of my album. I've been trying to get the last card for over a month."

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

            "This app seems to be littered with dozens, if not, hundreds of ads that have been up for, in some cases, over 2 years. I sent one a message asking if it was available, and didn't receive a reply. After seeing that the ad was still posted, I also noticed that it was posted 2 years ago. I saw a few other listings that had the same story. I liked how LetGo didn't leave listings over a couple months old without asking the lister if it was still relevant.",
            "This app is far less usable than Letgo was. The second I click on one thing to see what it is, I am immediately bombarded with listings of similar items from ebay. If I wanted to look on ebay, I would use that app. Don't assume I need to see 20 of that item. Prices aren't listed in the browse page so I have to click to find them. And when something sells, it doesn't disappear. It just stays with the other listings and says \"Sold\". I dont need to see all the things I cannot buy.",
            "Over 70% of the messages you will get will be fraudulent scams (they are quite obvious, but it's annoying to deal with). There is not much support for when you have issues with the app and I kept getting my posts removed for items being \"intangible\", which was not true, had photos and descriptions of actual items and there was nothing I could do about it, so it just became pointless and frustrating to use. Stick with FB marketplace or CL or other platforms",
            "Titles, descriptions, and prices of items are not shown in search results, leading me to click a bunch of images only to see that the item is not what I want or out of my price range. PLEASE add titles and prices to search results page. Also the gallery of pictures that are not in any order or in one grid make it confusing to look through listings. I don't get what the intent is... To have me looking through the app forever and never finding what I am looking to buy???? Please fix the UX.",
            "The app already sucked, but now it's worse. Why would you combine 2 apps and not take the good from the other app? To many old listings, nothing expires. Messaging is a joke, you're better off talking to the wall. An speaking of messages, how can I sell something if I dont get notified? To many times I've had to open the app just to see multiple messages, days old, and the buyer long gone, thanks offer up. I remember when this app came out, that was its prime, now it's just garbage."

Can't get past the second cell level bcuz i cant go back to the cell to see the code on the wall for the safe. There's no help button so don't know what to do next and it just tells you things like \"I wouldn't touch that\"... not helpful. Cannot adjust the sound and the sound/ voices are of poor quality. I don't know if it's freezing or what but this game is slow especially with no tutorial or help button and you think you've tapped and collected everything already. Just sitting here about to uninstall if I can't figure this out or it doesn't move along a bit.",
            "The original version was pretty good. Got stuck on the blocks for a bit, but the challenge is the whole purpose of the game. Would've rated higher but on the reloaded version, after leaving the cell, I could not move in any direction (not even to go back into the cell) or click on anything. I had already used up all the items I had found too. I'm not sure if it's a bug or if I was supposed to do something else, but it's a little off putting.",
            "I liked it and played half of the game. But especially when I'm in the underground and solved the find the way puzzle and then when I got out, it asked again to play the \"find the way\" puzzle.. Nearly 7 times I played that game. Its not fair at all. I went even to the next puzzle but when I exit the app and opened again, it asked me to play \"find the way\".. Frustrating.. I uninstalled now.",
            "Great until the end. Spent ages trying to solve the red green yellow balls. All the walkthroughs I watched, there was a string of 3 balls that only affected each other so easy to solve. Mine did not have this and I do not believe this is solvable. Disappointed",
            "Booo! The puzzles within the game are seemingly pointless, not fun and u have to repeat different versions of the same puzzle u just cracked!"

            "Quality just keeps going downhill. Seems like bugs get bigger with each update. Lately, when trying to locate another phone on our plan, it can only tell me the county that the phone is in - which is absolutely useless information. Other times, it can't locate the phone at all. AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",
            "App wont open, keep getting notifications saying the app is updating...been doing this for 3 days..why is it updating for 3 days....not able to use it at all. This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",
            "This app is terrible. Att Smart Limits was a much better app. Each time I unpause my sons internet access, he has to restart his phone for it allow him internet. Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

I will buy ticket to travel from One country to another country. (Suppose that I will go from Japan to USA then I will need to buy ticket, like $1100). There will minimum 3/4 railway stations on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One area to another area .

There should more of job like buildings which we can go inside to take keys of the vehicle(for rent) parked for the job.After any job is done we should only be able to get money by collecting it from its departmentbyparking itsvehicle back",

            "This is the best app of its kind. I go into the settings to manually set the skip silence and I have the best experience for multiple projects. I use this for music, capturing dreams when I wake up, recording important conversations, and sorting out ideas. I've downloaded this on multiple phones, I just wish there was an apple version of it.",
            "It's Great! Does what it says it'll do and so far and especially with as much as I use it, no crashes, glitches or stall outs, (which used to happen a couple of years ago with older version of both app and phone). I've always re-downloaded this app specifically because of its definitive reliability for all that I need it for. It's also a definite 'must have' for interviews, appointments, sessions, and lectures whenever needed. (Only thing I might ask is for more updates playback options) Thanks",
            "Great, simple app that opens quickly, is easy to navigate, and does exactly what it proposes to do and nothing more. When a native recorder was added to Android recently I considered switching to it, but it has a fatal flaw: it's difficult to get your recordings out of it. This app records things to a well-known place that it shows you via its settings.",
            "I've been using this app for a few years now to record song ideas and stuff and they finally asked me to rate it so I decided hell yeah why not this app is a free high-quality recorder and has helped me out immensely and they don't constantly bombard with ads and and ask you to rate all the time I noticed this was the first time they asked maybe they just do that now but anyway I said \"let's do it.\" Hope u like that sentence. 😎 This is my primary recording app and I prefer it over the others.",
            "Why all the high ratings for this I just ran the app and tested the recording quality of talking with my phone locked and my phone was directly next to me and all I got was muffled inaudible garbage. Perhaps it is good for speaking directly into the mic recording but if you need to record a class or something with your phone closed it seems this isn't the app for it. I had high hopes for this app back to the drawing board."

            "Love the app, however it would be better if you could read a whole book without having to wait on new chapters everyday, I love the werewolf stories, but another thing, if all the books in a series were placed together in order it would be much better, some I've read were out of order I believe, please think about putting them in order, also what's with the coins? It doesn't show how to use them in the app, mine are kinda just there",
            "This is, in my opinion, the best of the free reading story apps. The writers tend to have less spelling and grammar errors compared to other apps. So far, there have only been 2 stories that I chose not to finish. My only complaint is if you want to reread a story you have to scroll all the way to the beginning. It doesn't automatically put you there once you finish.",
            "Good stories but there are reading limits for the day. 5-7 \"chapters\" In and it won't let you continue until the next day. Really. Really. Annoying. There's an ad free option where you watch one long ad and get 15 minutes ad free. Which is helpful since otherwise the ads pop up every couple minutes. All in all, lovely app but could use some changes to make it more reader friendly.",
            "The books are good, but WAY too many ads. If you read fast, it feels like you spend more time watching ads than you do actually reading. Also, the limits on chapters per day is ridiculous. ESPECIALLY in a time where people are stuck inside due to Covid. I love to read, and i don't know anyone that does, who would want to be limited to a few chapters a day. Unlimited? No..thats just not true",
            "This app is great if you want to read free romance novels of any kind. There are a lot of ads though and if you can't stand grammar or spelling mistakes, I would not suggest this app. Overall a great app but the ads are kinda rediculous. This isn't approximate but it seems like there are ads every 15 minutes. Some stories also only let you read 1 chapter a day but this is not the case for all the stories"

Like if your like me, you don't mind the ads, but my problem is that I heal the same patients over and again when I come back into the game. But good game overall. I really like your game Pepi Wonder World.",

I will just dislike you more. Oh god cut it out already! And again! Stop! Yet again? You're wasting your advertising budget. And again, you waste your ads. Your advertising system is cheating you, theu show your ads to the same people over and over again. No new people at all.",
            "I really like this game, but at level 25, there is no warning, difficulty does not increase, they just stop giving you goals to proceed, and the game is over. You can harvest all day, but you're not progressing any more. Also, the ad with the big long harvest blade is false advertising, you never see it. It was a fun game, but sadly lacking in the end.",
            "This is disturbingly addicting. I cant stop playing for some reason. I do have a slight issue with the controls, though. Sometimes it feels too sensitive, and sometimes it seems to turn in the opposite direction of where it want it to go. Also, time extension bonuses would be a wonderful addition. I feel bummed out when I'm so close to getting a personal goal, but im cut short by a few seconds.",
            "I love this game but it froze up. This is the second time. I had to delete it and reload the game. I,m not doing it again. No other game has done ever this! You get to level 25 and I guess thats it!! GAME Same old same old from then on. Done it, good bye, hope they expand it was fun.",
            "This game is SOOOO MUCH FUN. Its not got that many ads as others are saying it has. Its a good way to pass time but my only problem is sometimes when time is over it asks me if i want 2x more than i earned and i pressed \" no thanks \" but it still gave me an unskippable add. This has only happened 2 or 3 times so it doesnt ruin the overall game. Still 5 stars🤗"

            "Used Groupon at launch, when it was actually a bargain site. Nowadays I hardly use it. If you search for goods on eBay/Amazon, 9/10 times they'll be £3-4 cheaper. I only use the app. Was offered 20% off next order, no code, link, or details. Pressed accept and it said it would be applied at checkout, it wasn't. Spoke to four agents on chat, all copy/paste template replies. When I started complaining, all four pretended they couldn't see my replies and that I'd gone idle and disconnected me.",
            "I absolutely LOVE GROUPON! It is the only app I use for my great deals! I get on there atleast 3 times a day sometimes more! The notifications are awesome! && I love how is a variety of things. The up to 97% off some things blows my mind! Such great deals. If you don't have this app its an amazing app and a great way to save money",
            "There should not be this many daily notifications for the little amount of content on this app. The search is garbage. It routinely shows \"deals\" in my area, amd o then find out my area is apparently two states away. Very few business use this anymore. While these are strange times, this was still the case last year. No worthwhile deals. All the goods sold herr are also pretty garbage deals. They can regularly be had on amazon on elsewhere for the same price as their sale price on groupon.",
            "Total waste of time. First, there were not many deals in my area. Then when we traveled with it, there was not much savings. Then it started charging my card when I did not authorize the charge for a \"groupon select\" there is no customer service to call, only email and online chats. I contacted them for the last year telling them to unsubscribe me, each time I was told it went thru. Is an act of God to get them to answer email or the online chats.

            "Some good deals, but not all what they seem and customer service is a joke. I paid $21 for 3 days of airport parking and was charged another $40 when I left. According to the Groupon, regular price would've been $30, so I paid twice as much as I would have without the \"deal\". I tried to chat with customer service twice and got no help, then disconnected in less than 1 min while I was typing a short reply, clearly because they didn't want to be bothered, and this is just one example of MANY."

Thank you for staying with us!",

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

Government of Telangana has established Shelter for Urban Homeless under DAY-NULM, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, Govt. of India in various ULBs. This Mobile app connects the Citizens to Homeless persons so that the Homeless find the Shelters by common citizen. \r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nShelters are established for Homeless in the State of Telangana. Many Citizens may find homeless persons on their way to home, work place, school, college, etc but they do not have information on where to take them or whom to be informed regarding such homeless persons.  There is a need to fill this gap and provide a solution that can make Citizens part of the initiative to reach it to the real beneficiaries. \r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nIn this era of Mobile technology every Citizen has adopted the new revolution and smart phone is being used for many commercial & personal purposes. It’s been a part of every one’s life. Hence MEPMA has developed an Android based Mobile app “URBAN DOSTH” where every citizen who has a smart phone can be a part of the initiative by reporting a Homeless person they spot nearby them.  By this the reach is increased.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n\r\nAny Citizen can download “URBAN DOSTH” app from Google Play store. As they Download they can choose their ULB (Municipality) and Area from the drop down. \r\nOn user Dashboard user have option to “Capture a Homeless” by selecting the option. Mobile Camera opens and can capture the picture of the homeless. \r\nApp also takes the location from where the image is captured hence the location is geo-tagged. User can give visible remarks of the homeless such as Gender, approximate age, wounds on the body, nearby land mark, location remarks etc with his own contact information on the form so that he can be contacted in case any additional information required by the officials. \r\n\r\nOnce the user submits the form, based on the location and area from where the form is submitted, system sends the information to local concerned officer & Concerned NGO/ agency who is maintaining the shelter. Local concerned officers can act up on the same and relocate the homeless/ destitute to the nearest shelter. Also when user submits the data, app shows him the location of nearby shelters. \r\n\r\nApp also facilitates users to view the nearby shelters information such as Shelter name, area, photographs, location, type of shelter, managing person/ agency, their contact information etc based on the location of the person; app also shows the route direction to the chosen shelter from user location via Google Maps.

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",

I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",

            "Thank you so much team! Bcs I searched a lot for home delivery of such products but most of them didn't meet my expectations. Some may be having problems with delivering to this particular location but coming to this app, it changed everything. It was quite difficult to be calm for not having fish for more than 3-4 months; even if I went to market I couldn't find the ones which we use to have! This app provides at least few from our list. The delivery is also good; no complaints! Best Wishes ❤️",
            "Good App, No Technical issues, and Excellent delivery. But the packing could be made mess free. After multiple instances of leaking package, I've stopped ordering. Very very careless packaging. Most of the time the seal breaks and water(smelly) leaks out.",
            "On time delivery and good quality of ordered items. Reasonable price compared to other apps. Lots of love Fresh to home ❤ Only one suggestion is, try to make it available of 90 min delivery for all items!! Because sometimes customers look for particular item but no option of 90 min delivery which makes them to turn to another app!! All the best team 👍",
            "Since no 4.5 rated it 4. Prompt in delivery and good quality. I did not use the app for long time due to negative reports about the App. For placing order it works very well. Yes offers like ADCB it doesnot work. Value for money for sure.. Dont compare it with deals and offers apps. The products are quality based. Certain quality products r slightly high. . 100% Value for Money. I have been buying for last 2 months. I use it almost daily basis. Worth trying it. Cut meats r excellent.",
            "Really good and user friendly app. It's a good app and it has More than 500+ varieties of groceries and milk and dairy products to choose from. and also it has Customizable subscription. i love the most is NO delivery charges and NO minimum order value. Feels great to share this experience :)and delivered a order before 7:30"

            "Honestly, I feel like this is the peak of infinite runners. The ads are inexistent, unless you deliberately watch them for rewards. The gameplay is great, and there's tons of events being held all the time + one marzillion collectibles. Does it have flaws? Of course. Sometimes the game is almost unfair in patterns, and unforgiving as well. Past 4000m is impossible, sans vehicles. All in all, one of the best games on the Google Play Store. Heck, on any app store.",
            "Okay normally I don't do this but I feel it's necessary here. I first played the game when it first came out. Since then I've reinstalled it every few years. Sadly there always seems to be a new problem whenever I do. I have had both my Jetpack and gadgets lock onto the current setting most recently it simply failed to save my progress. That said the game is still fun and you can play as much as you want and the\"game\" part works just fine. Just be wary if you try to customize at all",
            "I love this game. Iv loved this game for years. It's been a while since iv consistently played it but I started it up again today. Iv had several good games but the last time I opened it, it was almost like I started over. Most of my coins are gone (I had almost 30,000), the last jetpack I bought is no longer purchased and when I pause the game, I can no longer quit or leave the game. I can only resume. Plus the latest upgrade I purchased is also no longer purchased.",
            "This is probably the most original mobile game ever. Yes, it COULD be called an endless runner, but this game is it's own style of endless runner. The items, all the way down to how the \"endless runner\" graphics look. If I could I would rate it a 10 out of 5 stars. Love your games! Keep it up!",
            "I love this game.Also it has got an update the update is very nice. Everyone should install this game. But today when I played this game it was full glitches. I thought to reset my mobile but when I clicked the app it took hours to load the game. The game did not stop loading and I got mad and uninstall the game. Sorry."

            "This game deserves a million stars out of five. The chance to visit another village is like visiting another planet. Mindblowing those villages are. That the game goes from night to day synchronized to the actual diurnal nocturnal quotidian circadian algorithm of natural time actually brought me to tears, in a good way. The spirit of the medieval forest is present in this smurfy app. Smurfeat emptor: October 30 2020. Paid $6.81 for lunar new year dragon and did not get it. App snapped off after.",
            "Played this game years ago and missed it, had to come back. Yes, there are glitches. Read up on how to manually save your game. The extra attention is worth it. The game is super cute, I found game support to be helpful when I had an issue. It's the only game I happily spend real money on, much to my husbands chagrin muaha! Love the development, the graphics, being able to create my village. Each day I look forward to opening up my village and working on it makes me smile.",
            "Super cute!! Look forward to playing with my favorite Smurfs everyday. Love the new updates and graphics. One issue I don't like is somethings are worth more money than the smurf huts, like how Fairy Prince Garth is normally worth $24.99. I don't think somethings will be worth the price we're paying. Other than that, the game is so worth playing or at least taking a look at.",
            "I wish i could do 0 stars. I had a huge village, including other locations like the grove etc. But It doesn't save anything after i last downloaded it. No new buildings, anything i place in a garden bed, it's just gone whenever i open the app again, even if it only been a few minutes.",
            "Excellent gameplay. You will not get bored if you play online or offline. Everytime more interesting things are coming...but for suggestion i just suggest that improve gameplay for story line and make more story thinkful and adventures."

Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "I enjoy the ability to listen to a book as I drive, the only to toddler-free time I have. I love the book exchange, so I can keep the books I truly love. It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "It is a very good game, for when you probably worked on this for months or even a year. One thing I would love is where you can drive cars and drive through cities and housework missions, where you can go to shops if you want it more realistic, you can keep the tablet. Then, you can have other drivers with turn signals that work properly because some games have horrible drivers, I'm telling you. If you want to, look at my comment. Update: Okay, thanks for the respond, I like your game.",
            "This game is good for wasting time and is rather relaxing. I do however have some negative points to share... 1)the controls are awful. I have the sensitivity turned almost down to nothing and it's still super sensitive. It makes it difficult to place furniture as one small knock and the item is out of line again. 2)the same tasks over and over again. 3)lack of furniture colour and details. 4)dirt and rubbish don't always load in and is hard to find.",
            "Absolutely love this game! It's so addicting and I've been playing nonstop for weeks, my only serious issue is The very last house, the most expensive one, I've reset the game 3 different times and every time as soon as I buy that one house and move to the property automatically I can no longer leave the screen of the yard. I can run around the yard, but I can't open my menu, my settings, can't use any of my tools, can't open the shop, or even any doors to actually enter the house.",
            "Pretty good overall. A good time killer. I have a few critiques, however. #1)Add an option to tear down and/or put up walls. I want to be able to move where my windows are, or put in a door from my bedroom to my bathroom. #2) Make a search option so you can find what you need to put in for a job. I kept finding myself looking over the catalogue over and over again trying to find something. Also maybe make subcategories for furniture so it's easier to find stuff. #3) Make dirt easier to find.",
            "Very good game, easy to use and simply explained. Spent many hours on this game. My only 2 minor concerns are, when it's dark it's near impossible to find all of the dark, a torch option would be good. And also another way of making more money would be good, it gets quite repetitive when working on a bigger house. Maybe daily rewards would be good, or more money as you progress. Other than that it's a great game"

They've dumbed it down to the point where I can no longer use the new version and I will have to go to one of the mirror sites and load an old version. It's the only part of Facebook I use and they managed to muck it up.",

I have also reached my limit in as far as any updates saying, \" Update info not provided by developer\". Last update has 2 many problems. After last update, my posts pass fast as if a speil game! When will fb ever learn? If there is no definition for the app. I will not upload it. I have to go to my frigging insights to do an edit on my spiritual angel page! One star is 2 much 2 give.",
            "Please add a message attachments, just like what's App has.... ,and also there is problem when I try to share link, the full link doesn't get generated and when we try to delete the message, it should be delete from both the sides, the sender and receiver side... Please, please, please..... It's a humble request...",
            "Messenger Lite is a good app but it could use a bit more improvements and features. One is that it should have a dark mode option, everyone is wanting it for months now so please do it. Also add the reply function and the option to unsend messages. Lastly, sending a file is such a good feature of the app that also should be added to the main app, but please improve it by retaining the actual file name of the files we send instead of changing it to randomly generated name and numbers. Thank you.",
            "Since the new update It is not working. I have new messages showing, but when I click on the persons name it never loads the message. No messages are showing up. I Am beyond frustrated. Before, I never had a problem viewing my messages and sending them."

            "Hilarious results. The app does not pretend to make accurate predictions about your appearance when you grow old, but the results will make you and your friends crease themselves. And this app does not have intrusive ads or make you upload your photo to the devs' servers. It's free too, which is worth a mention. Combine the results with the sister apps bald booth and fat booth for even more fun. I just hope the devs will continue to update the app so it can still work with newer Android versions",

            "Only shows a wrinkly grey screen when you upload or take a picture in the app. I couldn't get it to show any faces and the one it did work for uploaded the photo sideways, so it didnt work anyway. Its terrible!! I used to use this app on my ipad and it was so much fun and worked like a charm, but now it doesn't work at all. If it would have worked, I would have considered the fact that it worked well the last time I had it, but since it doesn't work at all, I have to give it a 1 star rating.",
            "I downloaded this app, and it is seriously just adding a couple lines for wrinkles, and they are basically just trying to get you to download this app because the title makes you believe that you can see what youll look like in a couple years, but the results are surreal. i am 12 years old, and even this in my opinion, is just trying to trick your brain"

I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",

The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",

One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "I have two contradictory things to say. First, this game is the best with wonderful 3D graphics, it could be more better with other animations as others specified. Secondly, this game is so damn ADDICTIVE !!!!! It is another type of the social platform where you get to meet different people and talk to them. What I want to say is that this game is seriously not for teenage students, as they are the easy targets of addiction. So, I would request to increase the age limit to 18 years or adults.",
            "The game doesn't improve, the only thing that improves are the item prizes but for the satisfaction of the players nothing is done. Developers should focus on game optimization, faster loading screen, smoother game experience, and events to keep your players hyped (not same event that happens every year). But i don't think they ever listen to their players suggestions or complaints. Could've been a better game.",
            "What happened to the daily rewards?! U used to love the game but now it is ridiculous! The price for animations are stupidly expensive, and don't even get me started on clothes! Since there is no more daily rewards it is so hard to get coins! Also we should be able to jump and stuff like that, and be able to do poses on beds and chairs. But PLEASE add more daily rewards and make things less EXPENSIVE!!! (SO not voting for game of the year)",
            "First of all, I love this game BUT sadly, I agree with the other reviews on here that this game would much more enjoyable if all items were cheaper/affordable and there was more ways to earn coins. Wouldn't this game be so much more fun if it were like the Sims where you could get a job and earn money and get job promotion too!? I think so. Secondly, Please allow us to sell items, return or trade with others. I'm stuck with items i no longer want therefore want to clear out.Please make changes!",
            "Mostly just fashion which is fine but, I really want to play soccer. Having a bionic goalkeeper outfit is great, but I want to be able to use it. Please add a penalty kick game or a 5 on 5 game so the soccer outfits are of use. Of course i would choose to play goalkeeper. Tournaments would be even better. That would make this 5 star."

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

            "Great fun game but I dont have any other maps...its stuck at saying coming soon. Also I'm maxed out at the last worm level 66 and the campaign+ is stuck at level 19 because my worm level is too low. Is this because I'm playing the free version?",

Let's just hope it can at least come close to the OG!!!"

Though the different obstacles & beautiful scenery coming at me at such a fast pace made me dizzy & semi nauseous. It's sad because I really could've delved into this game for hours on end. The music is relaxing as well. Keep doing what you're doing Noodlecake studios!! 5/5",

Love the beautiful scenes backdropped behind with a wonderful soundtrack, super chill, wicked game, I love Alto characters, this game rocks!!",
            "Really fun, it's the same, just running but the challenges can be difficult so it's not bad at all. I always play it on the bus to school because I don't have mobile data so I can only use non Internet stuff. This is really good and you should install it.",
            "Developers, I really love your game but i have some ideas that may do this game better. I think it's a good idea to add all the features of Zen mode in a main mode because the combo score and another numerals distract you sometime and this beautiful musical composition from Zen mode deserves to be heard in a simple mode. And the second idea is to add kilometres score in Zen",
            "The ads ruin it! Clicking X still opens the ads!!! FIX IT! The game itself is nice and fun, ads finance it, makes sense. But these ads are too often (debatable) and when they are done, clicking the X to get back to the game opens them in the browser. This is borderline harassment! A second click after. going back to the game app, clicking the X closes it. So it is intended by the developers to get more money as your click is now also triggering their website. FIX IT, this is cheap!"

Don't get me wrong, this game could really use a MAJOR update, and i hope in the futer the developer will make that happen. If you want this kind of game, i would much rather recommend Taxi Game. It's still not great, but it is better than this. X(",

Daycare 3. Space theme 4. Hospital 5. School i know these already exist but they would be cool to customize. 6. Pets to the customize list 7. Clothes to the customize list. 8. Masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to the list also. I know its a lot and it doesn't effect my game if they don't exist. I love your game! Bye!",
            "This game is amazing I love it so much and it is even better with the free updates , I can not believe they are free! But talking about what is free or not,the game is only starts getting really fun when you make purchases which is not so cool. Over all amazing game it is fun and cool.I love toca boca !!! I hope who ever reads this rewiew has a long awesome life,may you find someone you love and who will cherish you forever . 🤗",
            "I would have given it five star but u can fix the bug that when we keep things in our house from somewhere else and when we reopen the game it goes back in it's original place and the full version of the game is very costly u can at least give the full game for free only for three days trail so that we can see the other places that how it is like and then buy it. But it's the best game for kids worth game.",
            "I absolutely love this game! However I think there is a bug now that they added the Halloween update. I have seen other reviews that say that the houses are total wrecks. Mine is the same. My houses I decorated have furniture just in a pile, and everything else is just purple. Purple walls, outside on the balcony is purple, the floors are purple, and I cant move anything. Please please fix this bug. I have spent a lot of birthday money on this.",
            "The game is overall good, but before I bought the misty cottage. I had an amazing world and I must have atleast spent 5 hours working on it in total. But as soon as I got the misty cottage, the game started glitching out. Early morning the next day I went on the game and my whole world reset. Now that got me upset. I wish to report this app and I want it to be reported and sorted out immediately. I have everything in the game and its around £70 for it all. Not funny at all. Sort it out please"

            "Why there is no glitch and ads",
            "So when I play the multiplayer game, the aponent's bar will run out and I will still have life but the game will continue on, until I end up losing!!??? Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "I have had this app since 2012 and it has been going down hill ever since. There are many bugs and glitches with the chat. The worst part for me is that the app is turning into an unmoderated conservative racist community. Posts that promote racism and fascism get featured daily and even the ads promote felonies... yes, felonies. Overall, this app is not funny, it is now just a hateful community with a political agenda.",
            "They took the shuffle option off featured. This limits the amount of time I actually use the app a day, considering I don't want to veiw the same pictures every time I open the app. 2/9/20 Not only have they not replaced the shuffle button, there's now an add that plays music, you can't click on it and it will CONTINUE to play music until you actually close the app. Not to mention, if you get push notifications, they show a feature out of the set. Most of the time its porn. Ridiculous. 10/18/20",
            "never use the app, the reason I'm reviewing is that when my friend would send me a link and text messages, it would open in chrome on my phone. this would be fine, but it obscures whatever meme or video there is, and says to have to continue. If you tap, it does not play the video, it brings you to the play store to install the app. I tried to work around it within chrome, but it does not seem to be possible. I consider this practice predatory as far as apps are concerned, and that is not okay.",
            "A majority of the features are just posted by bots. By blocking 10 accounts, I've successfully managed to avoid seeing well over half of the posts in the featured section. I've been here for years, and even the \"ifunny support\" bots weren't this annoying. If this keeps up, the app will find itself without a loyal userbase very, very quickly. DMs are broken now too, and keep bugging out weekly. The app is also growing increasingly laggy and slow.",
            "In the past I complained about the app crashing and horribly toxic community that consistently goes unmoderated. Not only are these still issues, but there are now more issues on top of this. The featured posts on the app are 9/10 times made by an account that is only a couple of days old. In my eyes, this means people are paying for their posts to be featured (which is the opposite of how they say the feature system works). I'd complain more, but I'm out of characters. Don't download. Waste."

        "comments": [
            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! 😁😁",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

            "Was working great but I didn't realize it was blocking phone calls from doctor's office, and similar places. No option to program it not to block those numbers so I have to turn the blocking off. Also everything prompts you to go premium...I thought the last uncarrier move said this would be free? Now it just feels like a additional ploy to get money out of us...sneaky.",
            "It's been a long time coming for this app and finally its here Thank you T-mobile I no longer have to go through phone call after phone call. I would get more phone calls from scammers more than my own personal calls on a daily I never wanted to answer my phone cause I just knew it was probably a scam of some sort I can't explain how annoying that is. So thank you so very much T-mobile....",
            "**Response to developer: Scam block is already turned on, it just doesn't work very well. Make the app better instead of blaming your customers please.** Doesn't block very many calls, but has blocked calls from contacts. That can be fixed by adding them to favorites, but it's still annoying. I liked it better when the TMobile system would say \"scam likely\" which seems to have been discontinued after this app launched. It sounds good but doesn't work very well.",
            "Useless, reroutes spam callers to voicemail. Basic app notifications are locked behind paywall. Just download Google Phone cause unlike this it's free, it works, and you can mark callers as spam from the phone app immediately, unlike this where you wait hours . App has a problem where voicemail calls and unknown numbers call don't appear, so you cannot mark them as spam. The entirety of this should be free for all T-Mobile customers. Better yet opensoure it, so people can fix it.",
            "At first this worked great. I wasn't getting any calls that ever said scam likely. Until the last few weeks I have been receiving four or five calls a day from a number that has the same area code and prefix as my number. I block the number, just to get another call from the same area code and prefix. Of course I don't answer. I block, they change the last four digits in their number and call again within 10 minutes."

Question: is it possible to include in the options menu the ability to move the controller position to the player's liking? The direction pad is spaced very far apart and it would be so much better if we could adjust the position of the direction arrows. Thanks for a great game!",
            "I really like it. Its simple, but in a creative sort of way. Id definitly recomend it. Edit: so they did a big overhaul on the game recently where the game speed seems to have trippled. This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",
            "An absolute legendary retro stylish action platformer!The multiplayer has crushed the goons having hard time with double players with hordes of skill!You can show you feelings to communicate with others, but a bug that's going around, if a player throws a goon to another player, the player gets damage the same goon does with higher amounts of upgrade, fixing it would help a lot, have a good day! :]",
            "My bf started me on this game and I have been hooked ever since! It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",
            "Excellent game. The multiplayer update is very good. Five star for it. But I had a problem. That is in multiplayer friendly I can't create a code. It says network error. We (me and my cousin) checked our Internet connection and it was fine. It happened yesterday. Today its fine. BTW I love the update."

            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard 💪.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

            "I don't review apps, but this one's special. I didn't and don't know anything about editing videos, but this made it super simple to learn... Step by step instructions and a tonne of features even without the pro version. This and the GoPro video editing apps are the best I've found for mobile. Going to buy pro... I think they deserve the revenue. I'm using it a lot with zero issues... Very happy. Thank you very very much🙏",
            "I really love this editor, it's simple enough to work with, and yet sophisticated enough to make awesome videos. Other editors have their watermark on the free version but this app doesn't and it's light enough for older phones to edit long full HD videos. It perfect for simple videos for YouTube/Facebook. Only thing missing is adding a fading effect at the end of the video, maybe it's only in the pro version? but it would be nice to have in the free version as well.. well deserved 5 stars..",
            "This is absolutely extraordinary. I have tried many other video-editing apps such as \"Kinemaster\" and \"VivaVideo\" but this is by far the best. The others contain alot of ads, glitches and are generally messed up. However this app has no video ads, (only small ones that are rare) it is very neat organised with the icons so that you can easily access and find your needed edit, I have been using it for a long time now and yet I have found no bugs or pay to win problems. I highly recommend this app.",
            "Great app but I already paid the one time fee and it just made me pay it again. When I tried to restore my premium it just kept giving me a fail error. I didn't even uninstall the app. Welp, now I realized I paid 12.99 for nothing because every time I open a photo or video I get an error message 4106 failed to open file?!? Now I can't even use this app.",
            "It's great. But sometimes It can be a pain to fix the mistake. But so far it has not done anything to me. Plus on top of that there is no watermark and you can fade the music in and out. Which would be perfect. Even though we may lost a few file.....it does not go well. Anyway I prefer this app to help me some few edit."

            "Mobile check deposit feature seems to have a bug, where it doesn't read the camera's orientation correctly after the first picture taken. It looks like the image is getting rotated again, so it's really squashed and not at the correct aspect ratio. You have to take the other picture manually, as the automatic feature doesn't really work when it gets into this state.",
            "I was loving this app for depositing check, since my company doesn't have direct deposit. But lately, after I take the photo of one side of the check, I can't get a photo of the other side, because the app wants to take the photo in a long skinny \"letterbox\" format. It's quicker to get in the car and drive to an ATM than it is to get this to work. It makes the app useless to me.",
            "This app just sucks. Rarely do I get the notifications that I set up in the app for alerts and if I do get them it's not until several hours later. Sometimes the app will open itself back up after I've already checked it and closed it out. Very frustrating to use. I've had several other banking apps and none have given me the problems BoA does. May be time for a new bank but until then my review of this app stays the same.",
            "This App is wonderful and allows me to have a full banking experience. It even includes a chat feature which guides you through different topics of questions or concerns you have. It's very convenient that you can request a call from Customer service in the App so that you have zero wait time on hold and you generally receive a call within 5 minutes Max.",
            "Terrible check capture. Clearly now a bug where you can only capture one side of a check. All subsequent attempts shows a skewed camera view and nonsensical pop-ups that renders it impossible. Only solution is to close and reopen the app, but you still can't capture both sides. Great timing when people don't want to visit branches in person. No QC at all during the pandemic?"

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "I am very happy with this game as it's all graphics are very nice designed. But only few there should be flying bikes and more and they should design this game as gta where the man can walk and sit in bike on engine. Except that this game is one of my favourite games"

There are waaay too much ads and some knifes are buggy to use. (When hitting something correctly, it misses!) I don't want to ever download this game ever and I don't recommend it! The game is no longer enjoyable.",

            "Awsome... But on the good lazer on combo you could make it too where when it's high up in the air the lazer could go inside of the handle also i have recomened your game to all of my friends cause you made an awsome game!",

But in that gamemode it won't let me. If I go off screen I will automatically die. Anything you guys can do?"

For centuries, the wolf packs have remained at the top of the food chain, maintaining the natural order, led by their alpha, the last remaining dire wolf. When the dire wolf goes missing, you must lead your pack to greatness. Select a gray wolf or a black wolf, and start building your ultimate wolfpack. A wild life simulation adventure awaits!\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE MULTIPLAYER BATTLES - PVP\r\n\r\nFight for dominance in the virtual world! Take on the world in online real-time multiplayer PvP battles. Hunt together with your team in co-op and battle enemy clans to control the most territory. Will you be the hunter or the hunted?\r\n\r\nUPGRADE YOUR BATTLE SKILLS\r\n\r\nCreate your ultimate RPG hero - you can choose which skills to learn and upgrade. Unique skills range from basic MMORPG abilities to fantasy elemental attacks - and even stealth skills which allow you to hide in the forest and become the ultimate predator!\r\n\r\nBREED & RAISE CUBS\r\n\r\nBuild a family and role play! A realistic breeding sim gives cubs stronger fighting attributes compared to their parents. Take your pups out with you as you raid other clans and hunt your prey. Your pups will watch your every move, learning important survival and life skills. Trail your pup well, else they will not stand a chance in the online multiplayer PvP battle arena.\r\n\r\nCOLLECT ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe alpha is the hero of each pack. You can duel enemy clans and recruit their alpha to your den. Collect wolves, foxes, bears and other wild animals, each with realistic and fantasy evolution skins. Each creature is rendered in stunning 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nLIVE THE STORY OF A WOLF CLAN\r\n\r\nA true survival simulator. When nature’s balance is threatened as the Great River has become contaminated, competition between the animals over the remaining spring water has begun. Even foreign tigers have been spotted far outside of their borders, causing concern amongst the rest of the animals.\r\n\r\nThere have also been rumours of ancient reptiles, rising to the surface from centuries of slumber, claiming the mountains and caves as their own. The gray wolves are now called upon to craft a solution in these troubled times.\r\n\r\nA MASSIVE OPEN WORLD\r\n\r\nExplore a huge, unbroken open MMO world teeming with wild life, from the dense forest, mountains to the freezing arctic. You can fight in online multiplayer PvP areas, tackle quests, role play, gather resources or raid enemy clans and take over their home. You might even encounter the tiger king on your adventure (a superior evolution of the natural tiger), who has been spotted in the forest for the first time in centuries!  \r\n\r\nGROUNDBREAKING 3D GRAPHICS\r\n\r\nExperience never before seen 3D graphics quality in a wildlife simulation MMO, with dynamic lighting and time of day cycles which bring the virtual world to life! Start your day at the mountain peaks, watching the sunrise with your pack before embarking on your adventure for survival and territory dominance.\r\n\r\nBUILD & DECORATE YOUR DEN\r\n\r\nCraft a home!

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

I found venmo because originally I was with cash app. Someone hacked my acct and cash app penalized me and closed my account with no option to open again.

Only way to escape is by exiting the app through task manager. The money always goes through to the other person but this shouldn't happen. Also often the app will just freeze while I'm scrolling through transactions. Sometimes it resolves itself, sometimes it doesn't. Otherwise, I would rate this app 5 stars.",

        "comments": [
            "It's a decent game, however when I approach a red light, and don't go through it, it says I went through it and I lose XP for no reason. Another note, Can you add sound mods for the passengers to communicate, and add ticket machines to use, it would be realistic and a better experience. It would be cool if you terminated at a bus station, and had timetables, for when you next leave and approach a bus stop. If you could add a button to click called \"Driver Shift\" which you click, (optional).",
            "Great game but there might not be traffic if they can they should add sort of realistic traffic and one more bus a Triple decker with 4 wheels on each side at back and front 2 on each side. So if you can do that this will be the best and most comfortable game to play but it is very comfortable already. Thank you. And I hope you can do it soon.",
            "It's a great game, but it needs some tweaking: 1. Passengers seem to fall off their seats quite easily, especially when going around corners. 2.Traffic and pedestrians don't always seem to be aware of their surroundings. 3. Being very close to traffic lights triggers the game into thinking I'm running a red light. 4. The vehicle selection menu would be much easier to use if it were tile/card-based. Other than that, I've thoroughly enjoyed playing the game! I hope to see more buses in the future.",
            "This is a good bus simulator but there are a few things I wish could change, these are: I wish the rain graphics would be better, the people graphics would be better, I wish there would be more controls for example: being able to turn the cabin lights on/off, the air conditioning on/off etc. And I've noticed a bug with the game, when I slow down and the press on the gas pedal it says I crashed it's very annoying and finally I wish there would be buses on the road and the passengers would talk",
            "This game is pretty decent overall, I like the XP system and the bus models and so on, what I don't like is very petty and can hopefully be easily solved. 1. The AI sometimes put the hazards on and brakecheck you then making your passengers fall over. 2. I would like to see the route creation system work better and 3. I wish you could put letters in the route number, apart from that this game is amazing! Thumbs up to the devs!"

Whenever you crash it's only your car that's being damaged. 5. There are no levels to the game to say you can unlock a new location or something like that.",

Sub tasks should show their parent in \"Next 7 Days\" and \"Today\", this would be super powerful for splitting a task over several days, it would be a game changer for me!",

Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
            "Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days.",

I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
            "Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again !"

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",

It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

I'd recommend Paper.io to people who just want a simple, fun game to play in their spare time. It runs smoothly, doesn't take up a lot of storage space or battery. I personally don't invest a lot of energy in this game, but I know quite a few people who love it for both its simplicity and bordom-killing abilities.",
            "Paper io. was extremely good last time. Now it's extremely frustrating. Many ppl say that it's difficult to control, and it's only about your own skill and understanding of the game. But the challenges are extremely horrible now. They take a long time to load on this same device (OPPO R9) and it is very laggy when playing the challenges, causing me to crash into walls very often. The normal mode runs so smoothly, why can't the challenges do the same? Please get this fixed.",
            "The game used to be fun, but now the controls suck! It used to be so smooth where you could just glide across. But now it's 90° degree angle turns and hard to control. It was also a lot less complicated. Please make it go back to being smooth.",

            "It's a great app to sell, I love this app because you will definitely will sell your old or new items here.! And for that I give a ☆☆☆☆☆ 5 star. I do recommend this App to anyone. And I love that they have priority mail which you will receive your package no later than 3 days. But I am giving a four star overall because I think the Poshmark 20% fee is to high. I think they should change the fee for smaller sales at least $50 and under (just an idea)",
            "I love this app the sellers are great I find that the people on this app for me personally are very honest and up front and friendly. Also I feel quite safe and secure when shopping and buying. And the merchandize are in new and like new condition, The prices are, in my opinion fantastic!! ❤😊I have been shopping on poshmark for a long while now and it's one of my favorite places to shop!! Love ❤️ Love ❤️ it 😉",
            "I have bought quite a few things off of here but I thought it was going to be more of a higher end marketplace app but really it is just another Kijiji where you can sell absolutely anything. The categories need to be updated so you can specifically look for tops in a specific size. I have to search a skincare brand because I can't find it in the categories half the time. And if you hit luxury you get luxury everything, again you can't specify if you want luxury skincare (my fave search)",
            "Easy to use app. Selling & shipping is very easy compared to other resell websites. As a buyer, there's some protection, you're allowed returns if the seller doesn't accurately describe an item. One downside as a seller is you have to be very active on Posh if you want to sell anything; at first start, it may take a few weeks before anything sells. Since COVID19, I've had a very hard time selling anything, not a good time to start as a seller but there's lots to find if you are a buyer.",

I turned off notifications for someone following me, next thing I know I have 25 notifications for people following me. Also the \"picked for you\" lists are nothing I would ever want.

I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "I've been on and off with this app for years. It's had so many changes throughout the years but this latest version has got to be the worst. The latest interface is just clunky. The old one was better. Another thing: there was two versions of this app. The original version was this free one. Now it's not free anymore? How is it that you guys are putting a premium on this one when you already made another pro version that you had to pay for? Just keep this one separate and free.",
            "Wow... just wow. Downloaded app a while back, and was pretty good! Unlocked all the fx options by watching videos, and was able to actually use the app.new update comes in, cant do anything but watch ads. Now even the previously free fx effects are now \"premium\", and whenever you click the fx tab, it brings up the subscription page, interrupting your doing. And when you exit THAT add, ANOTHER one comes up! Worst update ever.",
            "This pirch bar is a joke, can barely set the bpm right without using the sync button. You ruined it, the previous one was way better. It's nice that you can apply 2 effects on a track at the same time unlike before the update, but now they're smaller which makes it harder to use with my chunky fingers, i often screw it up because of that. The eq slides were narrowed down, bad idea. The automix button just simply shouldn't exist or place it somewhere else where you can't press it by accident.",
            "Don't even bother updating it, when you try to change the tempo/pitch of the song, its too hard to get it accurately to where you want it to be using the bar, the way it was before was way better and the worst part is they charge you for recording, they'll do everything and anything for money....",
            "I absolutely love love love this app great for beginner djs or just to have fun my only problem is that I cannot record anything I mix through SoundCloud even if I do buy premium. if there is a fix for this I would love to hear about it also would like to see more personalization opinions when you do pay for it"

            "Please update this game again! I am tired of the blank screen that comes when I open the app. As a result, I havn't played it a single time because I can not open it. I even tried to delete cache data and restarted the phone, the memory is also enough, but can't solve this problem. Please update and remove this problem to get 5 stars.",
            "So i am having the bug that everyone else is having, The black/grey screen. But, i bet that they could fix it soon in the future. For now im gonna judge it by the graphics you gave us to look at. I have to say, The graphics is pretty good, Especially the night. I personally think that this game is pretty good! Everyone is keeping on judging on the grey screen but everyone, think on the positive side! Once they fix this bug, Imagine you playing this for 1-2 hours. I hope this bug will be fixed",
            "as most other people are saying,i just get a grey screen after the bus simulator logo, I used to play this lots when it was known as bus simulator 2015 and it was a very good game maybe even better than bus simulator 2017,but now I can't play it. 1 star until i can actually play it.",

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

That will make this game 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆. You should also give more guests. This game really need a update to be 5 stars and I will be eagerly waiting for it. And it is so nice of you that you have not added any adds and I hope in the next update also we will not find a single add.",

I would like to have more characters. Maybe ones we made in hair salon can come here, like a linked game. Other than that it is funny and entertaining. Certainly you can download. But plz check on characters too."

            "This app is a poorly engineered solution to a fake problem. Android comes with an excellent visual voicemail system, and it worked great for years, right up until T-Mobile shut down their support for it and made me install this piece of s--t. Update Oct 2020: It's now even worse. Every time I start it, it tells me it has to delete all my voicemails because it's \"associated to a different account.\" It then tries to sell me \"text to speech.\" At least now I know why it exists. It's a money grab.",
            "Breaking third party integration so they can charge $4 a month is about as \"carrier\" a move as you could make. Voice to text isn't worth $4/mo, but it angers me that the so called uncarrier is ruining the capability for customers using third party apps. To top it off, this app they try to force on you is buggy. Late messages, annoying and pointless notifications, trying to trick you into extra fees. Too bad we don't have an FCC willing to protect consumers from scummy companies like TMobile.",
            "Don't know what happened but finally this app is doing what it's supposed to. I now receive notifications of new voicemails and haven't received the Dreaded daily error in about a month. 3 stars so far as I shall wait to see if this app continues to work. Still, in one way sad that my expectations were so low that now that I can receive a voicemail ( something that should be so simple) I'm excited about it.",
            "Worse voicemail set up I have ever used!! It just flat CANNOT be depended on. Shame on t-mobile for not paying attention to consumers and not doing something about this! Just read the reviews! The factory voicemail set-ups that come with phones (samsung, ect ect) work perfectly fine. This stupid app is a joke. Come on t-mobile....figure it out!!",
            "Terrible performing app. Never get new voicemail notifications/sync on time. I always have to go into the app and manually refresh it to watch the loading wheel turn and turn until finally the voicemail appears. Often buggy and doesn't always find the voicemail when refreshing it. Very frustrating after previously having an iPhone with wonderful visual voicemail built in."

            "I really like this game. I will still play it. But I really dislike the new art style. It feels cheaper in my opinion. I have not heard the sound design yet (been playing with volume off) but I hope its the same as before. That is my real only complaint. If you could revert back I would very much enjoy that. just the art design and animations that is. Everthing else is fine. In short, it feels like a downgrade not a revamp or an upgrade. But this is just MY opinion after all.",
            "It's really great to see the miraculous return of Monster Dash again after a decade or so. (The hype is real.) It's a pretty quick paced game that gets straight to the point, and it's also fun at the same time. So overall, it's a pretty noice game! (This is actually the first time I've ever said this much while rating a game. I guess I'm pretty proud of actually have enough courage to accomplish writing this whole text. Woo.)",
            "I really love this game!! So much fun to play. This is the best game, in my opinion, that you guys have made besides Jetpack Joyride! You gotta love Barry Steakfries!! Keep up the great work developers!! I look forward to seeing all the great updates you have in store for the future! This is a definite 5 stars all the way!",
            "Ok I for one would like to say Love, Love, Love this game. I played it a long time ago, I was a bit shocked and happy to see that after all this time ITS BACK! It reminds me of all the great time I played it back then. I have one problem tho. The speed of the game picks up too quickly. I get that you guys want to make the game a bit more challenging the time period is too short can you guys do something about that?! Would you guys consider maybe adding in some boss fights, could be a great Idea!",
            "Controls are slow one moment and fast the other this makes the game unenjoyable. Also I've noticed that all of you at halfbrick have said it's \"back from the dead\". But it feels more like it's back and buried for good. The only real new thing is the expensive costumes and the update in graphics. Please add new weapons that are useful and affordable. Also I believe a change of colour to the spikes on the yeti area because they're hard too see."

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game 👍♥️👍♥️",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

            "Sorry folks,got to down grade my review. First: New players don't fall into the Facebook trap it's more trouble than it's worth. Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",
            "Was running fine & progressing nicely until it tried to force me to accept a Facebook policy, I cannot accept the cookies as screen won't drag to press accept as screen size has changed, so it means I'm no longer able to send help/ items to friends or ask for help with reports at the end of each case, also feeding pets has changed to adverts only which now takes forever....really disappointed & frustrated so please change it back to 5 min timers & cut the excessive adverts for everything"

We are all different & \"one man's meat is another man's position.\" Any venue can have an, \"off day\" ditto waiter, receptionist, chiefs, etc. It's an 'over view' I seek, a feel for a place. NB: don't just read reviews of places - but also reviewers reviews! Be aware of 'planted' (paid) reviews & reviewers.",
            "Good with booking a hotel, bad for booking a flight on Tripadvisor. The reason being is that I look on a different booking site for flight prices, compared this to expedia and expedia is the best bet for booking a flight as their prices make sense to me. Step up your A-game in the case of booking a flight Tripadvisor please!",
            "The best app for finding your way around a new place. It has all the restaurants and is almost always reliable, and is very useful for finding other things like attractions too. I wish it would remember more things when you switched off the app (ie switching to WhatsApp and then back) as its a pain to have to find the page you were just on, but it's still really a great app.",
            "You ruined the app. It used to be my go to app for restaurants and hotels, now it can't even find a location less than 1km from me. Not only that, when I did pull it from the map (which is also wrong) it said it was closed. What a joke. Don't expect me to use this app anymore.",

            "Very great, I use this for maps all the time. The only problem which prevents me from giving it a 5 star is because of the slow downloading. The maps I download are barely even 1 MB but it takes a while to download. Would change back to 5 stars if you would speed up the process of downloading. Thank you very much.",
            "Thank you so much sir, This is really a grate app but it has very minor problem or only some problems but I wish they'll we be fixed. I have rated it 5 ⭐s. ~Grate app ~Best for Minecraft ~Easy to use ~Nice experience ~Really entertaining Please answer my 1 question. Please 🙏 My question is : You are from which country? (Waiting for answer) At last again - ⭐ nice app ⭐",
            "The app is great and all the maps work In just one click 😃😃. but one thing I had to tell that you should add more photos for the maps ,add an option for uploading any image related to the map. In that sense we can view the whole map and how it looks.",
            "With MineMaps you can browse hundreds of awesome maps for Minecraft and \"Crafting and Building\", install them in just one tap and play right away! Installing a map is as easy as clicking \"Download\" and then \"Play\" — the game will open automatically with your new map installed & ready to play!

            "A very great and helpful game!, but it stays as 4 stars. Simply because the issue that i was downloading the chicken catcher game. Then every time i open my minecraft. The map will download repeatedly! So please fix this....or have I just not understand that i clicked something?"

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

I like the ability to add and subtract areas if interest. They mark ads/sponsored posts pretty well. Pretty speedy on all devices, even somewhat older ones. Overall a nice news agragator.",
            "I've been using flipboard for years. Now like 80% of the content is videos. And NONE of those videos actually play. It's so weird. They have some new video set up, every time I click on a video, it doesn't play. Just black screen. Click on it, it goes to another black screen. So, two major problems rendering this app useless: 1. Nearly all news is now in the form of videos. I don't want videos. I want to read, and 2. Those videos don't even work. How do you not beta test this, Flipboard??",
            "If I open a page on source like golf or mma or something like that, I get articles that cover something else entirely. I'm really annoyed that I spend more time reporting articles that are not on topic and I don't know why this hasn't changed in years of reporting these articles... Please do something about this.",
            "Been using flipboard for quite some time since you can customize what news you see or just flip through all news. Biggest down side is tbe comment section is really subpar and broken up into different sections. Dont even bother commenting if you see 100 plus comments because your comment is lost at the bottom. Other than that is a nice app to see any news you want.",
            "Can't share URL if you click a link inside an article. Steps to repro: 1. Tap into an article 2. Tap any link on the page that goes to a different site 3. Observe the top toolbar shrinks from several items to 2 items. 4. Tap the share button in that toolbar 5. Pick literally anything on share sheet. 6. See \"Couldn't Share item\" error every time. If you fix this bug lmk and I'll revise my review! Update: Flipboard denied this obvious, reproducible bug. Smh. Bug does not happen on ios."

            "Completely unusable app, none of the pages load, I can't change anything about my account, I can't even view anything about my account, it has been this way for at least 3 years and across three different phones so it's not just an issue with my phone or something temporary. I'm not sure how this app got any five-star reviews not going to lie. if anyone is able to use this app and it's helpful to them in any way, I would love to know your secret.",
            "This app is sooo buggy and nothing has changed for the 3 years I've been a customer! Can't update any profile information ever, it's so annoying. One way or another something is going to glitch out and you won't be able to finish your task or it won't recognize it or won't load the page or whatever. Wish I could just delete it off my phone...",
            "I am satisfied with my service there are no hidden fees or added charges each month. My bill is consistent and that is what I wanted, other networks raised my monthly bill without communicating with me and it caused a financial hardship for me. The T- mobile app is user friendly and easy to navigate. I am very happy with my T-Mobile network service and I would recommend T-Mobile to my friends and family over any other network out on the market today.",
            "I love the T-Mobile app. When I put my new SIM card in my phone, it was not activated yet and I could not make phone calls, but I was able to use the T-Mobile app to live chat with a representative who activated my SIM card for me. Thanks T-mobile! There are also many other things that you can do using the app including lots of information about your account.",
            "Any other app would get 3-4 stars, but T-Mpbil4 has excellent standards and Ledger exclusive customer experiences across almost the entire board except with this app. In one word, this app is CLUNKY. Processes move slow, 2-step verification can close the app out, any smoothness you have is totally lost w/ pop up or split screen and navigation feels like traversing the wreckage of a 4-app collision. Note 10+ 5G this is not hardware issue. 1 star only to bring it to yalls attentjon"

            "I love this editor, it's easy to use, doesn't crash like others I have tried. The 4 instead of 5 stars is simply because of the time it takes to process the final video. Other apps for a 5 minute video takes around 5-7 minutes, this one took 30 minutes, which to me is far too long. Especially when some of my videos will be at least 15 minutes long. I'm dreading the wait on those ones.",
            "Awesome easy to use video editor! Many great features. I accessed and edited right from the videos on my Android phone! Others I tried were awkward and not as many simple to use features. Try it out and 0lay around with the music and effects , just to name two out of dozens. You'll love it! No, I don't work for the developer! Lol😁",
            "This is great app. No watermarks and excellent editing software capabilities. Easily rivals computer editing software. My only problem is there's no backspace or Ctrl+Z (however you wanna say it) so if you make a mistake, you can't undo it. Please add one and this will be my new favourite editing app. It's also user friendly! :D highly recommend",
            "I've used it once so far but it is very handy. It has variety of music and I read the option to even put your own. It allows you to add to your photos as text, transitions, music, and many other things!! What I had used was ALL FREE. Definitely recommend. There are adds but eh everything has ads now-a-days",
            "It's actually nice and user friendly specially for the ones who aren't that 'techy' . However, there was one problem that I faced which was that when you try to add any media at the starting of the video once it has been made, the whole audio that is attached to the previous media moves in front and leading to all the audios to move ahead. When you try to push the audio back it actually kind of gets trimmed."

            "You'll hear this a lot. Game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ready to spend time to build your own little city you can do it without any diamonds, premium currency. Community is really helpful and good guild can make all the difference for one to stick with the game. It can be played on both mobile and browser, which is great because as city grows more time is needed to get it to run optimally.",
            "Unbalanced game play, players with much a bought stronger army can attack and plunder your items, super slow game play unless you're a pay player, I've been stuck for sometimes a week or more trying gain or trade for items to advance research, like I stated before if you throw real money at the game you can buy your way to the top a thousand times faster.",
            "Great game! If you're looking to \"beat\" a game, this isn't it. It's a slow roll, even slower if you don't purchase diamonds. The game play is good, and even at a slow pace, I'm entertained. I do have a suggestion though.. I'd like to be able to sell my buildings to other users, especially in my guild. If I could get forge points, goods, etc instead of auction $, the game would be even more interesting.",
            "Great game. However, a couple of suggestions 1. Please add a currently online/offline feature for players to see. Doesnt have to be seen by everyone, maybe just by friends and guild mates. 2. Please add in a last online feature for friends and guild mates to see. It is very hard to manage friends and guild list when you have no idea who are active and inactive players. 3. I find this game compared to most hardly gives out the in game currency(diamonds). Maybe try handing slightly more to players",
            "The game is so bugged I can't even start playing it right, but also I have it's a pay to play game . I've put my 10$ in this game to see if it's worth it, but honestly didn't even reach the point where I use them cause game won't load event or story and so on.... In short- no."

            "It's an really enjoyable game but I wish there were a couple of changes. One off those changes is that they added a gear lever or an option in the setting to have one. This is one when your breaking and coming to a stop you don't end up driving backwards. The other change this game could have is to be able to turn the person faster instead of having to swipe on the screen multiple times just to turn around. Other than that I love this game",
            "Yes, I know it is in beta but it is very buggy. I get stuck in the ground, the car camera glitches out and that is only SOME of the experiences I've had. The Demon is WAYYYYY too drifty. Please try to fix these issues by the next upcoming updates. I will rate 3 stars (for now.)",
            "This is very cool and addicting car driving game but please make an option for adjusting and customizing game control button's size and position. Then I will give this review 5 stars. It is very hard to turn the vehicle on steering wheel option due to its smaller size. And please add vehicle customisation like vinyls, paint jobs, spoilers, lips, skirts etc (to make the car looks cool and unique from other players).",
            "The game is detailed good, atleast it's the first time I've experienced such detailed car simulater game. Also it's quests are easy and interesting. Graphics are also great. But there's a bit problem in it. We can only get out of the car in first-person view. I'd like it if you give a button to exit the car in. Third person view(back of car view). Some of the games effects are derived from NFS Most Wanted, I noticed that. But overall I loved this game. Also it's offline.",
            "It is a good game , but I think there should be cars like Toyota fortuner, innova and rolls royce. There should taxi in which we will also be able to hire and there should be more mafia missions , this are the things that I would recommend you to add at the next update. But this game is a really good game. please add the( rolls royce phantom model) add this rolls royce car because this car would make the game more interesting.please add this car by the next update , and the game is interesting"

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

In each of level I complete. Please please please try to fix the problem. That's all. However the game is not so bad. Thanks.🙂",
            "I love this game soo much because if you dont have data this be ur side but the matter is the add is so long the car is like following the line i mean is if someone in the car and just ask can we go to mall and bla2 thats why just follow the line but i wish if i dont have job like no want need a car i can drive around the place but than no i love this game so much but for me just that and one thing i just dont hate this app but just want to share everyone have a mistake so yaa..😉 And stay safe",
            "This is a good game to play when you have nothing to do. But just 3 problems...1 is that everytime you finish a level there is ALWAYS an add. SO ANNOYING. 2 is that after a few levels the game always shuts down on it's own. And 3..when we do those turnings, the car just goes and dashes my car; and the computer says that I loose points! So unfair, but other than that the game is fun. Please try to fix these problems..Thank you! 😊😊😀😊",
            "This game is amazing. When I pass get this ad I feel that this ad is not so good and the game also but the letter I am wrong when I will download this game I played the game so much that I reach so many levels in 2 minutes I also suggest that please download this game and enjoy your Quarantine time in home, u don't have to do anything in home or somewhere play this game in your home with your family in this quarantine time .",
            "Great game guys, this game totally deserves 5 stars from me l guess...& l noticed that this game has less ads than the other games. So, well done for that, this game is very relaxing to play & l'm telling all this by the way l feel during playing this.so, love it..but, sometimes l crash the car but, l wount blame my foolishness on you guys or the game... it's clear that l need to improve my driving skills...okay anyway Good job guys keep up the grate work & we want more awesome games like this."

            "I love this game so much! I only had it for a week and its already my favorite. I have a couple of things that could be fixed though. Usually when I get a friend and I check my friends list they are not there which can be annoying. Sometimes when you try to load into a multiplayer game the map randomly isn´t downlaoded and it kicks you out of the game which is annoying too. It would be really cool if there was a friend and clan chat when your not in game. But overall this is amazing. 5 stars.",
            "Very amazing game. This game is very simple. You basically hunt animals and eat them to level up (if your sensitive to blood there's none in this game). You can even raise a cute family! [Maximum family members is 6). You can also change your animal, and it won't loose your progress! You can change it to a fox, bear, cheetah, crocodile, etc! HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃!",
            "I love this game but could you help me get on multiplayer because when I go on multiplayer it kicks me out and says Error connection to server timed out and that happened for 2 years! And it happened for no reason. I could not fix it! And it's still happening! Has that ever happened to you? And when 1 day passes I can go on multiplayer but if I exit and try going back it does the same as I told you at the second sentence.",
            "It's hard to control the eagle with flying, otherwise the controls are pretty darn good. Though I do know my phone is somewhat small and it's hard to simulate flight. I do think they should (if possible) add more plant variation like with bushes in certain maps. Maybe an aquatic update too? As someone who used to play when there was 3 play able animals, it's awesome to see this game grow! Sorry if I set my expectations too high or low, I just want to see the game improve for everyone.",
            "I love it, it is such a great game I have so much playing with outher players and by my self. But, there is some lag if you go on top of the land a little bit behind the poltel you can go throught that bit of land, be stuck there and have to tellport to your den. Beside that it is a great game. (In the clacis one.)"

            "The app is usually great, I'd have given it a 5 star rating, but lately it's been a problem where it doesn't connect to the VPN server it stays on an infinite loop and I have to force stop both my browser and my NordVPN app, then restart them both just to get it to work. The app is still having lots of issues, when it works it works pretty good, but when it's not it's a real headache to use. Please fix the app, there's going to need to be a good update.",
            "Quality has been getting worse lately. Pro: can set auto connect for wifi only. Com: Shade notification's \"Disconnect\" doesn't work, just auto reconnects! Pro: VPN... Con: Services like OneDrive and Photos stop working reliably due to provider blacklisting. What's the point? VPN's may have outlived their useful life, but this app could still be better than it is.",
            "Unlike the paid websites saying that this service works in China, reality is that it can't connect from china for many months already !!! Their support is a useless chat not that recommends you to download OpenVPN with a zip containing config files. Really? Edit: to reply the dev, I have other paid VPNs that always work in China, without using a third party app. And why use OpenVPN app when own NordVPN app handles OpenVPN protocol? Total non-sens...",
            "Updated: Nothing but issues with this service. Either the app or the service itself is complete junk. I've had nothing but connection issues using other apps like Wyze cam while using thIs VPN. I have tried the split tunneling and it doesn't work. I can never connect to my security cams while running Nord.I have switched back to my previous VPN service Torguard and everything works perfectly. Goodbye Nord, you got my money but never again.",
            "After the latest update the app doesn't work anymore. When I want to log in I'm being taken to my browser to log in there. That doesn't activate the app though. The app is now rendered completely useless. Please fix ASAP or let me know how I get my money back."

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

Example, \"there's a special loan offer\", where?! I have search for it, when the app should go right to the information that is on alert notification, and not just the home page. Many alerts I just ignore, because I become frustrated trying to find them. Just open directly to them once pressed, otherwise I'm just wasting time seeing the same information.",
            "I really love this app and the website. It's convenient and easy to use. My only complaint right now it that no matter how many times I click on \"Recommendations\" and scroll through it, it ALWAYS says there is 1 waiting. It's been going on for a while and it's on both desktop and mobile, so I know it's not just this latest update to the app. I don't like the advertising of the credit cards all the time but I get it, to keep the app free you need to have ads, no problem. Recommend me stuff all the time, I don't care, just register that I've seen it once I have.",
            "Great app, I mean ausome app, in less than a year, this app has helped me get all three of my credit scores boosted. They were all between 510-530 and now, only a year later all three range from 622-643. So this app has done wonders. After a year of doing what the app said I went from having no credit to having 3 credit cards and owning a house. SO CREDIT KARMA GETS A 10 STAR RATING FROM ME. I USED TO SPEND MONEY AS FAST AS IT HIT MY POCKET NOW I HAVE OVER 10,000 IN SAVINGS AND I'M A PACK RAT.",
            "Good app, but this latest update sucks. I don't like the new UI, and it feels slower now. And one thing that's been bugging me forever, when you open the app and it displays where you enter your pin, raise all the numbers up. It's way too low. But the in app UI sucks now. Change it back please. It was easier on the eyes before and easier to read",
            "I've been monitoring my credit for a couple years now with Credit Karma, but this is thee worst update they've done! Not to mention, your score in the app will never be what a lender pulls. So I just use it to monitor credit card usage and any collections. Other than that, the app is garbage. Edit to include CK's response: I already know that. I am informing others, because clearly your formula isn't accurate. And if it's not accurate... it's not useful."

Most days now have no places visited and I just don't understand where all the data has gone. I've tried clearing cache, restarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app - nothing. At disappointed.",

I had done all possible troublshooting and failed to update the app. I also sent feedback and yet to receive a reply. I also cannot contribute to google local guide, where I crosssd level 8. Looking forward to your support. (15 Oct 2020) Still unable to use this app! (20 Oct 2010)",
            "Really like Google maps it is accurate and normally doesn't glitch out. But for the last 3 weeks it has been giving me trouble. It won't give detailed directions while driving; basically goes turn right then turn left, with out giving how far until I need to turn or what street I need to turn on. I tried going through settings to find a solution but nothing has worked. I have searched through page after page on Google to find a solution but have not found one yet. I have a Samsung S20 5G.",

I have been using this app for I can't even tell you how many years and recently just stopped working. doesn't find any of the addresses I'm searching to go to and won't even find my own location. ***I did uninstall updates and it seems to currently be working again without the updates. Send it to me to an article isn't what I'm looking for from the developer. I'm looking for them to fix their update.",

I have uninstalled then reinstalled for under a minute temporary fix then it does it all over again. I can't get any numbers or find my way unless I zoom into the map and follow my blue icon showing where I am. If I didn't know how to read maps ill be f***ed. This is bad."

My only problem is that it really isn't receiving updates and there isn't as much stuff as there is in the OG Geometry Dash. Honestly I just want the game to receive a bit more attention and I'll be fine",
            "This game is so awsome i can only text short but this is 100% cool right but actually there is a secret in GDW plus there was alot of secrets in this game but actually i cant get the medal called \"Cold As Ice\" right guys and use some headphones so you can hear some cool song like 100% cool remix but i want to tell guys, im not a pro im a 5%pro and i can only finish easy,na and medium mode but i cant beat hard mode and modes right and thats it okay!!!!! I love Geometry Dash okay!!!!!",
            "This game is so fun! There are tons of obstacles on the way and the songs are so good! It gets harder on the way all though I had this game before it's as exciting as the first time I played it. I am Aiyah and this is opinion of this game.",
            "This is a really cool gd game, and it gives you more features than Lite. It allows access to some featured levels, your previously downloaded levels via save bug, etc. I really want to have a new island, however. The amount of stuff is still very limited because the levels don't update. Keep making updates and new games, because you are doing pretty good 👍"

            "It is an amazing game and it is really relaxing. I was fully depressed last month when the exams came, for 2 days I played this and then it was just so smooth. In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "This app used to be my go to, it was the best. I understood the reason for slower speeds, but I can't subscribe to the recurring payment, as its far too much. But this is outrageous. The speeds are at an all time low for the past three months now, and the payment system is ridiculous. They already get lots of ad revenue from the app itself.",
            "Have had a good experience with this app. But the last month have had problems connecting. I'm hoping it is the Wi-Fi that it connecting to. IDK. 🙄. Well I finally got this application to connect to WiFi. IDK what happened but it's working now. I hope it doesn't happen again. Because I'm not sure what I did to make it work. There was so many things that I did.",
            "Aye bruh, literally watched ads twice and my 200 coins went down to 30 twice. Every time i turn on the vpn it resets my coins. This is a scam, they get money and you don't get to use the vpn right!",
            "Psiphone pro app very bad . Psiphone Pro VPN Asus is not being connected for free in any way, since the apps update.Not being connected anymore.So now the Psiphone Pro app is a very bad app.",
            "Most efficient and reliable, particularly for unblocking censored websites. Yet, I don't like when it opens a built-in original phone browser though I prefer to use different browsers, and it takes quite some time to close one browser and open the other. Otherwise I am happy with Psiphon. Thanks to the developers."

Either than that it's really a good game 😘😍😘😍😘",

This game is one of the most annoying games I have ever come across. This game seems to be a very interesting game but when I try to play, it starts to fool. Please do something about it because I cannot just waste my bundle to achieve nothing. I'm very bored today because of this game.",
            "The game is good but not so good. When we this game the graphics and background are merging and the people in the game they are also merge with each other and their is no so long and hard level but when we go to full the tank of petrol we have to give some many money 💰. I don't like this game very much. I will give only 2stars Thank you!",
            "From all rickshaw game this is the best game as campare to other Rickshaw game. I like this game. Just one thing there is problem that when you win all the levels there is no things to do with this game and you have to unistall this game. So I want to give some improvement that if you make the endless game then it's good and also improve your graphics. Graphics are not good",
            "The petrol gets finished very soon. And the driver says the same line \" I Come as soon as possible\" and I noticed that the auto do not have the excess to airport , garage , railway stations etc. And another thing I Noticed that the game is different from the pics given in the discription . But I liked the multiplayer mode."

            "When the app was still up. I remember after school going on my phone and watching vines for a while. It helped me escape from school and relax. Always made me laugh. It was really sad see this app die. I miss it so. I don't think I ever left a review on an app. But I'm glad to give this 5 stars for the laughs it gave me.",
            "This app sucks. It linked to my thermostat fine, but it gives an error if you try to use it for anything other than see what the temp is, and now it won't even do that. I open the app and it immediately closes. Luckily me Alexa will still control the unit.",
            "I downloaded it thinking \"omg its vine back !\" But I download it it opens up and has some options like private policy bla bla bla I click all of them, none of them show me you know JUST HOW TO LOOK WT THE VIDOES, so all i have is that screen with the 3 choices...so yeah how do I use the app?!",
            "Bring back vine! I miss it and it is so creative! TikTok, Is nothing but people getting followers from taking other people's fame. Instagram isn't \"FAIR\", but Vine was the one... It had the best insperation and creativity. BRING IT BACK!!"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Very confusing. Every time I try to login I have to change my password. Takes me forever to accomplish anything with ATT. I uninstalled this app, could not get it to let me in. Wanted a wireless number that I do not have. All I want to do is pay my bills. I go through some kind of B.S. every month. Between being on the phone and using the simple AT&T app I have been at this for well over an hour, and still have not paid my bill. Ridiculous!",
            "Update: Originally I could never pay my bill with the app. I always had to call in and explain the difficulties each time. The last 2 or 3 payments have been made so smoothly I would have to say this is now one of the better apps I use. Thanks for fixing all of the issues I have noticed. Original post: This app is absolutely junk. I have so much difficulty with paying my bill each and every month. It just sits there spinning gaining no traction.",
            "I don't really know how good this works. It seems to be working a little bit better now, but it is still having problems remembering my USER ID AND PASSWORD. OH Well, I really hope that is just temporary. On one page it thinks it's 1 thing and on another page it thinks they are something else. For the third time, THIS APP OFFICIALLY STILL WON'T LET ME SIGN IN!😠😠😡😤 OTHER than that I guess it's ok.",
            "Its been 2 months that me and my wife switched from Verizon to ATT, and yet have been able to get login into an online account. We have spent many hours trying to get this resolved with att and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue, still to this day nothing has been done. The customer service is very unprofessional, and possibly undertrained. I've never had such issues with Verizon and Verizon service is always top notch. Will be back with Verizon after our two years are up.",
            "This app is garbage. You would think AT&T would be sure the app was functioning properly so people could spend money with them, open new accounts, etc., But instead this app literally never works right. It always crashes. It's just garbage. Which reflects AT&T well because none of their stuff ever works. Their service is garbage. And their CUSTOMER SERVICE is even worse. This is so sub par. Verizon is far superior in every way. Unfortunately I live in the woods and AT&T is only one that works"

Or dying after watching an ad for the extra life before you even get to touch the screen. You shouldn't be able to die on your own area. I wish I could choose the plain black square, as the other colors are easily confused as I am color- blind.",

I play the game and I am instantly distracted by the longest name ever that goes WAY off the screen. I die. The controls are a little bad, or maybe thats cause I'm on a chromebook. I like it, but I think it works better on the website. I don't trust VOODOO anymore cause I think you guys make us play with robots on the apps... none of these names look real... Anyway, I had fun. Gud Game.",
            "Watching a video to get an extraordinary, only to die immediately after respawn, despite being in your area is dumb. There are glitches that make you lose a ton of covered space. I had 30ish percent covered....and for no reason went down to less than 5%. Fix these issues for a better rating",
            "I love this game, it's addicting, time killer, fun, & once you see your score go up you will want to get a higher score than that. but it does have some glitches right now. it keeps shutting down, stops working, some times the ads won't play, & suddenly it does work.",
            "The app is so good . But the problem is They can show at the top in the whole map where we are in small version , Show our way after the game is done where we see our percentage how much we covered . And the frustating thing is there is no way to exit ads 👿👿👿.pls fix this problem then your game will be in top 3 🙂"

I keep force stopping and deleting the cache but these messages don't load for hours. I don't use the standard call-in voicemail and haven't had a password set up for years.

            "This game is really really nostalgic, I've been playing since 2012 alright, but you guys really really need to fix these bugs and stuff that's making the game suck. You can't see your friends movies anymore, your friends pictures, the statuses are just for Nova and Zac, and the game lags. Like really bad. But, otherwise this game brings back memories.",
            "I love this game!! But it does have some problems. I think you should be able to earn diamonds just like you can earn fame and starcoins. My account got hacked 6 different times so I feel like there should be more protection than what they have. The game is so fun and addictive though I get stuck playing for hours!!!!!",
            "As much as I love this game there's a lot of bugs that need to be fixed no one plays the games anymore because you don't get rewards, my game keep glitching out even though WiFi bars are full, and for some reason I get a message saying its getting late chat opens in 1 hour, im 18 this doesn't happen to my 12 year old sister. But over all this game is fun but needs some work done.",
            "the app is horrible. it's so sensitive to everything. you can type one number and get locked. and how do I know ? bc I did. I typed the number 5 and git locked for \"sharing password\" the game needs to grow up and I don't recommend it to anyone it's a waste of time and money. and they don't refund you your money when they lock your account. just bad overall.",
            "So I've been playing this game for a long time on pc and mobile but the thing is on mobile I can't log out or anything because of the black bar. I've tried it on a different phone (Samsung) it was fine no bar or anything everything worked but the phone I mainly use (Motorola) it's like the screen is slight moved to the right so it's not fully on the screen which makes it hard for me to log out, exit profiles or movies. For msp 2 I have no problems with any of these things."

            "My experience has been awful. After the 1 month free premium trial I tried to cancel my subscription it would not let me. Day 6 of trying to get a refund, countless hours spent on the 'live chat' feature which kicks you off every 3 minutes. Emailed them with link below. Haven't heard anything yet. This is incredibky disappointing and shows that I cannot support this company with my money as it seems impossible to speak to someone or get an issue resolved. Utterly disappointing customer service.",
            "For a professional tool, there are way too many bugs. For instance, when someone sends us a connection request, we can't click to see their picture. It simply doesn't open. Same thing happens with replying to their message. Unless we accept the connection, go back and enter into the person's profile properly, many features don't work. Sometimes the app needs to be restarted in order for it to start working again. A month after this review still no info from the developers team... Disappointing.",
            "I really like LinkedIn app but I guess your app is couple of steps behind your website. Watching live events on the app is just like being tortured! Comments cover the screen in landscape mode, and if you want to turn it back to portrait mode, the screen becomes too small that makes it impossible to read a single word! Would you please fix it ASAP?",
            "The app is useless for the last few days. I'm following a highly active community on LinkedIn. But same posts from 3-4 days back is always there on top of my feed. No matter how much I refresh the feed, new posts won't appear. I tried everything from clearing cache to reinstalling the app. The feed is like my profile now. There are posts I've liked and commented. Even if there are no new activities on the post by my connection, it's still there.",
            "It will be nice if you were able to edit a conversation piece that you accidentally sent that had mistakes, and that you wanted to correct or unsend. Example if you were sending date each text message (case in point this a speech to text) and there a lot of errors in it. Then you accidentally send it. You can't unsend it. It should be a way to fix an error after it's been sent or unsend something."

            "It is a very nice game. I am playing this game from a very long time , around 4 to 5 years , but now you have to pay for some customisation and for some fast cars which can only be bought through diamond . Please add more places other than city,airport ,port and off-road. There are two more modes, police chasing and another which always show coming soon . I've been waiting for those two new modes , please launch the other two modes soon.",
            "Brilliant game, love how easy it is to get cash. Just one thing though, everytime I try and resume theres an ad, could you make it like every 4 times you click resume or something. Also, some of the time trials and drift challenges are impossible to do in a normal car, like the 20,000 cash on on offroad with 31 checkpoints and 3 laps, you cant do that in 4 minutes, it's impossible without an offroad car which cost way too much. The 5,000 and 10,000 druft challenged on port are impossible too.",
            "It's been so long since I played this game and I'm so happy with how this game improved! I think I first played this game around 2015 maybe and I enjoyed it! Five years later and the graphics have improved and the game quality improved too. However, I don't like that there is now limited customization with the vehicles--nitro is one example--but I think I can pass on that. Another thing I hope to see in the future is more areas besides the airport, off-road, and the port.",
            "I have been playing this game for a very very long time now. During this time I have absolutely loved playing this game. However some minor issues ruin the best experience possible. Such as : at high speed my car will start bouncing on the road and ruin my speed records. I would really want this fixed. A cool feature would be a turbo sound ! In feed in the game the turbo only increases the speed of the car. However the sound of a turbo is always great to hear. Please add one.",
            "Actually a fairly decent game, few flaws though. The drifting challenges are very hard since they want you to learn how to drift while in a straight away..... still a really good game despite the few flaws it has. Also turn off wifi and data so you dont get ads, but the ads arent too bad if you want to keep it on. The driving does take some getting used to."

The lists is kind of the whole reason I downloaded this app. It will only allow you to sign up using a Facebook or Google sign-in. If you don't have one of those, or don't want to use one, then tough luck! Probably uninstall..",

Used to have a perfect integration with both Navigon and Sygic Truck navigations. Sadly, it has been removed from Sygic Truck lately, making my life much harder, as I depend on pois due to my job. Amazing app, 6 stars if possible!!!",

For example I cannot access my menu when browsing, I have to go back to the home screen. Also there is a bug if you want to upload a photo of a cafe. I have a feeling the app was never touched/improved since 2 years."

            "This used to be a fun game. Since the last update it is horrible! I can only spin 4-5 times now before it just spins and doesn't take your energy. You are not able to store more than 40 bombs at a time. I have to go out of the game and restart my playing in order to do anything and even then it does not always work.",
            "Used to love this game, my whole family did but recently we have had amount of spins reduced from 120 to 20 , when you land on a gold slot instead of increasing money its decreasing. Theres no way in progressing on your islands anymore. As for cards you can always fill one section but you never in whole time ive played get chance to fill a booklet as the cards are dealt unfairly . So am close to deleating this app.",
            "Not giving me ny daily bonuses or anything prizes at all, wont give me any extras when i land of them or anything at all for at least the past two to three days and its making the game to where i cant get anywhere else in it at all and making me just want to get rid of it all together and i dont really want to have to do that because its taken me a while to get to level 123!!",
            "What got into you, why have you reduced the level of super spin, I am on 113th level and my super spin is reduced from 120 to just 20 why??? Even the amount is reduced, how is one going to complete the island😵😫 it has made me totally disinterested in this game, may be I'll just try to complete this last level and stop playing pirate kings.",
            "Game is another pay to win. Wheel stops at the same amounts when you bet bigger. I have also noticed it stopped giving any new cards. There is no reason to have 30 of one card. Lol. When it is not wanting you too spend money but it is geared for making you pay. Deleting."
