This valuable new tool provides inspiring stories to help you reach the finish line each day, and whether you prefer to read or listen - daily coaching is a great way to kickstart your day with inspiration.",
        "comments": [
            "It's a good app, but the alarms aren't as customizable as I'd like, and some of the elements are a little confusing. It took me way too long to figure out how to delete and reorder things, it's not as intuitive as HabitRPG. That being said, it's nice to have a community to participate with- or not. Either way is acceptable, and no feeling left out or pushed in. Useful tool for helping serious change, one day at a time.",
            "This app is amazing, but geared heavily towards women. As a person trying to build a more masculine frame and personality using this app seems a little bit counterproductive to my goals. In my opinion, this app would receive a 5-star rating and high praise if it were gender-neutral. Over all, a very good app. Clean interface, detailed, motivatinf, and easy to use.",
            "It's a really sleek and informative app. I'm just on the trial bit so far so good :-) I wanted to add - after two years of using this app, I am finally beginning to live the life I know I deserve and have worked so hard to achieve. The Fabulous has been an invaluable tool in helping me stay focused and achieve goals one step at a time. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "This app has given me space to do something just for me, which as a new mom can be tricky! I really like the journeys and goals and habits, but I find that the interface isn't super user friendly and I often find features by accident and then have no idea how to get back to them. Maybe I need to play around more, but it would be nice if there were less hidden nooks and crannies, so to speak. Overall, love it and am so thankful for it!",
            "I uninstalled this app from my phone recently, then found that I had paif ¬£45.99 for a year's premium at 50% discount. I have no recollection of this....... but no proof either. I've just cancelled all pre-approved payments on Paypal to avoid anything like that happening again. In the meantime, I've got use of the app for another 12 months and so might as well use it. It's not worked brilliantly for me - it's basically a habit tracker."

            "Easy to use and there's a lot to explore. I wish that the web version had more functionality like the app, and that everything would sync in between the two. It would be easier to do the thought/journal exercises on my computer rather than in the mobile app. It would be nice to have everything available in both web and mobile app.",
            "Wonderfully calm and resourceful! I see a therapist regularly but have found Sanvello to help me in the in-between times. So far love the meditations and articles on the home page. Only thing is I wish I could change the order and content of the tiles on the home page. This might just be a feature I have yet to discover as most things seem to be easy to customize.",
            "I would say this app really helps with stress and puts your mind at ease. They continuesly say that your bad feelings will not last for ever and for me that gives me some kind of validation. I also think this app really focuses on meditation and throughout the meditation you can really just try to let go and connect with yourself. This is my first day on this app but I went on it because I felt anxious and now I just feel relaxed.",
            "I'm definitely a fan of this app! It doesn't block a ton of features so premium isn't super necessary, which is helpful to a teen like me, I love the community features and the personal hope board as well as the mood tracking, it's all very nice and definitely helpful",
            "Sanvello came to me at the right time. I was under tremendous stress and not knowing where to turn. My employer told me about Sanvello and decided to try it.

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",

And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",

And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",

When you feel good about yourself & happy with who you are, you will find that this attitude also raises how you view your own life & the world around you. As such, gratitude creates positive emotions, like joy, love, and contentment, which research shows can undo the grip of negative emotions, like anxiety.\r\n\r\nThere are several incredible books like The Secret, The Magic by Rhonda Byrne, The Power of your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy, Gratitude Diaries and Simple Abundance that have explained how Gratitude works wonders in bringing the change in our lives. There are several personal coaches, mindfulness coaches, yoga trainers & mentors that have found Gratitude journaling to be the best start towards self development and self love. It‚Äôs not always easy to effectively deal with tough situations like abusive relationships, financial crunch, grief, trauma, depression and attracting the wrong people and circumstances in our life. And at these times especially, it‚Äôs tough to bring a self change and change the circumstances. Keeping a Gratitude Journal and Practicing Positive Affirmations could be great start and baby steps towards shifting your negative energies to positive.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the app or getting start with your Gratitude Journaling Journey, please don't hesitate to write to me at sankherpritesh@gmail.com\r\n\r\nYou can find the Privacy Policy for the app here: https://gratefulness.me/privacypolicy.html\r\nPlease find Terms & Conditions here: http://bit.ly/3077uoX",

Maybe I'm missing something.... this app has taught me how to be happy again. I began with 2 entries a day and now when I'm bored I get on just to journal. it's great therapy!",
            "This is a really slick and effective app. Simple, like all the best things, and good at stimulating the habit of daily gratitude. I especially like the daily zen quotes - I come back for these and it helps me remember to write something positive too. Great job!!",

            "Its unfortunate that they dont advertise the Student discount. $9.99/year is astoundingly generous of them. Thanks! But I dont think anyone knows about this deal. I only learned about this when I accidentally stumbled across a YouTube comment from a year ago. Awesome app, great stuff for sleep. It do be crashing though. Just recently, so idk if it's just me or everyone else got the same problem?",
            "This app was brilliant when I first started using it every day - especially during lockdown - but now that Headspace Plus is a thing, it's way too expensive to access to the soundscapes & meditations that I was using before. The selection available now, without Headspace Plus, is shockingly little especially considering I am already paying for the app! I liked a nice mix of things to help me sleep but now I can only listen to the same three things on rotation which isn't great. Not happy at all.",
            "My 5-year old and I saw a commercial for this app which featured a cute animated video of a \"robot\" slowly shutting down its systems in advance of falling asleep. I thought this would be a great app for my kid to watch while doing bedtime, so I signed up for a (pretty pricey) subscription. Immediately was disappointed by the fact that no such cutesy videos are ACTUALLY part of the app (most of it appears to consist of streaming audio). Feels a bit like false advertising...",
            "I only use this app for the Sleepcasts, they're very peaceful to listen to and I usually fall asleep after the first 15 minutes or so. A few months ago they offered 3 to listen to for free, but now they only offer 1, and all of the others are behind a pretty high pay wall - its incredibly frustrating, especially during this time and all the stressful things everyone is going through in their lives",
            "Just updated the app for the first time in around a year. The new organization of meditation options is awful. Examples: you have a lot of activity-specific meditations, but the only way to access them is to remember what they're called and search. Also, i don't want to have to scroll forever, past lots of meditations that I'll never be choosing (e.g., kids), just to see what's available. Alphabetical organization of every option is tedious and difficult to get through."

            "Far more useful and life-improving than expected! I've been using daylio every single day for almost 2 years, which is both an achievement and a testament to the app's ease-of-use. It's still being actively developed so great new features keep popping up. An app that I'm very happy to support and recommend.",
            "I bought the app, but when I switched my phone, they didn't saved my purchase, restricting me in use of the app. Although premium version still valid and working on the old phone. Ridiculous! Btw: asking monthly subscription for the app, for which you don't even need to pay for servers, is the most violent insult of your usersüñï",
            "Great tool to help you keep track of life. I like the fact it works with speech to text so I don't actually have to type down my journal throughout the day and it helps keep track of things I want to do things I'd like to do and just things like that. it reminds me to do stuff a lot which honestly sometimes I would forget and it's honestly help me a lot with my depression by just reminding me to like be kind to myself and things like that. I highly recommend it.",
            "I have struggles with remembering to do simple daily tasks and keeping a routine in place. This is the only app I pay for because its the easiest to use and the only one that's ever actually managed to keep me on task and keep track of things. I highly recommend it for anyone with executive dysfunction, ADHD or autism if you need help staying on task or remembering daily self care!!",
            "Great mood and activity tracker. I would really like the ability to still log things after midnight as the same day. I am having to customise the time and date for late night entries because they don't make sense to include in the next day. I haven't started that day yet! I think a \"day start/end time\" we can set would be an easy fix, much like choosing if weeks start on Sunday or Monday. I hope you consider this feedback!"

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I love this app. It is the best one I have found, so far, which is really free. Other apps make this claim, but then block access to certain material unless a payment is made. As a fairly novice meditation practitioner, I found this app invaluable because there is a beginner's course and intermediate course. Following on from these courses there are a variety of packs for different situations. From daily meditations to managing stress or anxiety, for better sleep, for walking, e.t.c.",
            "Wow, this app is 100% quality. There is content for every situation and it is free. For those of you who are tired by commercialization of meditation apps - this is an app for you. I like that there is a simple customizable timer. Although I don't understand what offline / online mode means in the context of it. Seems like the meditation track is streamed anyway. Developers, could you clarify what that feature does?",
            "Hands down the best app I've ever had for meditation. I've used so many other apps but this one is the only app I've actually stuck to using. The interface is so seamless and so easy to use. And it's 100 percent free. No sneaky purchases or special meditation packs. That sort of transparency is much appreciated and I honestly wouldn't mind donating or paying. I don't know how to support you guys other than this, if there is literally any other way to help, let me know!",
            "After trying several meditation apps (Simple Habit, Headspace, Atom, etc), I like Medito the most because it's simple, user-friendly, and beginner-friendly. All sessions are free and the selection is well curated, which I love because what frustrated me with other apps is that too many options can be overwhelming and having series wherein some episodes are free while others are paid can stunt one's growth. Their \"Getting Started\" collection is useful particularly for a newbie like me, as many of the other apps do not offer in-depth tutorials on what to expect and how to practice correctly. As a cherry on top, I like the options for background sound, especially Spring Field. The audio is balanced well with the voice, so it's not too loud nor soft, and it plays seamlessly. It seems like a small thing, but it's something that had bugged me and turned me off from other apps. If I had to nitpick - it would be wonderful if you can expand your collections under Sleep Meditation and Mantra Affirmations as they currently only have a handful each.",
            "This is my first meditation app and I find it very well made. You can pick what kind of meditation you need as the sessions are divided into sections. The voices are very calming. I've been meditating for about 4 months now and I can see some improvement in managing my stress and being a nicer person in general. Thank you guys and keep up your work!"

            "Easy to use; accessible and very blind friendly; thank you. It's getting very hard to find an app that isn't overloaded with unlabeled images, buttons, and circular sliders. Thanks for a straight-from-the-hip, getter-done meditation app. You're welcome. I'm really grateful that the reminders are verbal as well. Most apps seem to think that visual reminders are enough, but blind people don't have the luxury of looking at their phones constantly, so thanks for talking to me.",
            "An excellent, totally free mindfulness app. Smiling Mind covers everything from children to teenagers to adult mindfulness foundations, with a variety of specific targeted mindfulness courses of all sorts to help with different areas like sleep, stress, relationships, work - etc. I've been using it for years and it's wonderfully ad free. As for mindfulness itself, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're curious, Smiling Mind is a perfect place to start.",
            "This app is so great when it works. It gets quite glitchy when it comes to member login and member data. It will not let me reset my password because apparently my email address is not present in the system but I am unable to register a new email address because I'm already registered in the system! When I was still able to login it would randomly delete my data and programs/progress. It will also sometimes just freeze in the middle of a meditation.",
            "I like the meditations however I dont like the layout and navigation of the app. A lot of the meditations are too similar, cant skip and have a long intro that I dont want to hear every time. The app logs me out often too and I have to login, which is an annoying inconvenience when I'm trying to relax to sleep. I fell asleep to it and it kept playing the whole night for 8 hours. And just then I was listening and it kept skipping to the beginning. It was rather creepy actually and now I'm on edge",
            "This app is amazing and has helped me to sleep again. I was relying on a number of medications to sleep but the guided mediations have drastically changed that for me. I cannot thank everyone involved in this enough, so I'm going to donate as well. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful tool freely available and without ads, it really has changed my life üòò"

We use the same questions and scores used by doctors and healthcare practitioners for decades. \r\n\r\nSo how does it work? Getting started is easy, just fill in a 10-item questionnaire to measure your self-reported level of stress. You do so by assessing feelings and thoughts during the last week.

            "I have started to use the application in 2009. Then I liked it. In addition to this, I've decided to purchase for premium, created another account and shared my notebooks with my premium account. Then I couldn't see my shared notebooks on the web and mobile. I've been struggling with technical support for 2 weeks. They have promised for full technical support, I'm writing but they haven't returned for 5 days. Unfortunately, I'm switching back to Microsoft Onenote.",
            "After the major update to the app, the note texts are not readable anymore. Looks like Evernote messed up the text color setting in Android. My noted works fine in iPad and on PC. I always leave the text color as default and never changed it. However, in Android, text is in dark grey in Dark Mode, and light grey in Light mode. So the text color is always very close to the background color no matter which mode I choose. And this MAJOR issue has been there for at least a week!",
            "Ruined after the recent upgrade roll out: 1) Notes take ages to load up. 2) All the fonts which used to be available have now disappeared and all my notes are suddently in Sans Serif. At least it wasn't Comic Sans. 3) None of the desktop keyboard shortcuts I used to use which made this app efficient to use have disappeared. 4) It needs to be online to work - unnecessary and annoying Probably other things have gone wrong - it's only been a few hours since the upgrade. It wasn't broken - why try to fix it?? I've been a Premium subscriber for years - now considering cancelling & switching.",
            "I used to love this app and I use it a lot for work and personal info organisation. The latest update is an utter disaster for me. It requires a constant internet connection, which I - and millions of other people on this planet - don't have. I used to be able to work on notes whether I was online or offline - a helpful little red exclamation symbol would appear on the sync item when the app couldn't sync because the internet was down, so I would be careful not to change to working on the same note on a different device. Now the app insists on me reloading the note when the internet is down and wipes out my latest edits. This is useless! I don't want to have to remove the sync setting as I do want the app to sync regularly when I'm online. If this continues to be a problem I will, finally, have to relinquish my subscription and migrate to a different tool. (NB the Windows 10 app update doesn't even appear to have the option to change the sync setting at all - in fact the settings menu seems to have disappeared completely!!!)",
            "After the recent update, I've lost all my notes from the past 1 week simply because they had not automatically synced. The update was automatic btw. Pathetic experience, and quite stressful too. I was thinking of upgrading to premium but will definitely not do it now, after realizing my content can be deleted anytime without a fair warning."

SCHEDULE supports the retake of missed sessions in history now. Try and get more circles.<br>2. Another upgrade! Tap the screen to check the pose list while exercising. It&#39;s much easier to browse and switch poses now.<br>3. New Courses in November: Winter Energy Flow-Intermediate Element Yoga, Easy Morning Yoga.<br>Monthly Golden Day, Thanksgiving, and Black Friday are coming!",
        "comments": [
            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",

It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ‚úîmark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

            "I find that sometimes there are technical problems such as the the screen being pixelated(like a television screen type of pixalation) or the app itself not working/crashing without reason (I already checked my internet provider and it seems like it wasn't the source of the problem). I hope such issues would be resolved in the future. The design of the app is very neat and clean. Also, It's great that you've put your policies in the display.",
            "Better than YouTube? Yes. Dailymotion has alot of content, movies to watch, a very clean interface and more up to date sleek channel design look, easy to browse, search filters for searching for videos. There are things which i would like to see for Desktop and Mobile. Dailymotion needs a night mode, the explore page needs a gaming and tech section, search filters needs to have more filters, bring back the thumb's up feature, the browse more section has too much sex and nudity kissing nonsense , that has nothing to do with what you're watching. Great site, but needs more features, but i do recommend Dailymotion over YouTube.",
            "Giving this a 5 stat just because google reeeeeally wants me to delete the app. Whenever I get a notification about deleting apps to make room daily motion is always near the top of the list, despite the fact there are apps I haven't used in almost a year near the bottom. It seems if it's not owned by a big tech corporation Google thinks it's a waste of space on my phone. Couldn't possibly be that google doesn't like a YouTube competator being on my phone.",
            "This actually regards the Smart TV app. It's horrible, logging me out often & we all know how tedious TV \"keyboards\" are for text entry. I have externally created playlists that do nothing. I can move to each playlist but clicking on it doesn't open it so all playlists are unplayable. Often, recommended videos start playing their audio stream in the background & can't be stopped. Other videos can't be played because unwanted, unstoppable content is already playing. Better 2 cast from Android app",
            "Some, if not most of the videos require following a link to sign up with details. Its hard to find series that you can just watch direct. Plus not all seasons and episodes are available. But as im persistent I take my time to click many videos before I find a link free episode, then enjoy that, but it can be time consuming. Glad it's free tho!"

            "A wonderful piece of work that inspires the mind and guide it. I have had mental blockades in the past that it helped. When my mental health started to decline those roadblocks became mountains that seemed too large for just an app to overcome. But I found my peace when resorting to Mindwell when trying to figure myself out. The application itself does wonders. Even when there's the occasional bug or issue, if you think of the issue presented as an obstacle rather than a bug you may learn more.",
            "Offers like approximately 30-50 things you'd like to work on like meditation, health, mental health, sleeping habits, eating, etc..... BUT YOU CAN ONLY CHOOSE ONE then 3 subsets in that choice. Like, for $60 a year, I'd expect to be able to choose 1-max offered. Not just one. Maybe the paid let's you choose 1-max but if not, you just lost $60 to get one choice out of a ton. Not cool at all.",
            "Better than 90% similar apps, has isochronic techniques to actually improve moods. Made me to rate it too fast in the app - at first day - even back button didn't work. There is 7 day trial, but has some info about cancelling - difficult to be sure it would work. So we probably need to built new amazing habit of keeping our debit card mostly empty to give it a try.",
            "There are many useful features on Mindwell like : Playlist creation to create and share personalized meditation programs, Stats to track meditation minutes and progression towards mindful and mood goals,... I have tried some of them and they are extremely useful!",
            "There are many good things to list about Mindwell : the user-friendly interface, its useful features , outstanding performances,... Nothing to complain at all!"

        "description": "Do you feel stuck? Wish to feel better, hop out of the negative cycle and enjoy better wellbeing? GGDE helps people self-manage their depression by learning how to develop healthier inner dialogue and use this power to improve their mental health.\r\n\r\nIMPROVING DEPRESSION IS POSSIBLE\r\nThrow away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your thinking and achieve mental wellness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk ‚Äì individuals‚Äô interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as depression, low mood and maladaptive behaviours. \r\n\r\nDO I SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION? TESTING YOUR DEPRESSION LEVEL\r\nWe all sometimes want to know how our situation compares to others and where we are located on the graph. In GG Depression, we introduce an intuitive and quick way for self evaluation - the Assessment level. Please note that the assessment is just a guide designed for personal feedback as well as mean for our system to personalise content based on the results. The assessment test should NOT be used as medical/psychological advice.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I PREVENT DEPRESSIVE THOUGHTS?\r\nThe foundations of healthy thinking and self-talk are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \"My choices have to be prefect\", I won't be able to live up to these expectations. My confidence will decrease, my mood will become low, and depressive thoughts will take over.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our confidence and self esteem.\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \r\n\r\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your thinking, start today! GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\r\nThe topics include: belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, hopelessness, helplessness, positive boost, being active, loneliness, feelings, self blame, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, fear of abandonment, trusting and more.\r\n\r\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS\r\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy policy:\r\nhttp://ggapps.net/privacy-policy\r\n\r\nTerms of use:\r\nhttp://ggapps.net/terms-of-use",

They wonder why they get sick and why grandfather died. They wonder why their wishes do not come true. Children also wonder about happiness and the beauty in nature.\r\n\r\nBecause the Buddha knew what was in the hearts of children and human kind, he taught everyone how to live a happy and peaceful life. \r\n\r\nBuddhism is not learning about strange beliefs from faraway lands. It is about looking at and thinking about our own lives. It shows us how to understand ourselves and how to cope with our daily problems using Buddha's Teachings. In this guide we will be learning about Buddha's beliefs, Buddha's Teachings, & the Buddhists way of meditation. \r\n\r\nIn this app, we have included:\r\n\r\n- Origins of Buddhism\r\n- Buddha's Teaching\r\n- Buddhist Beliefs\r\n- Birth and Karma\r\n- Buddhist Ethics\r\n- Buddhist Meditation\r\n- Buddhism & Purpose\r\n---And more. \r\n\r\nThe teachings of the Buddha are vast, but there are a few basic Buddhist teachings and practices that are fundamental to the path laid out. Although all of the teachings offer us an understanding of the tradition, here are a few that are at the core of Buddhism. We are offering an overview of each teaching in order to really understand how Buddhist's think and where the thinking originated from. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of Buddha's teachings is to show you the nature of the human mind, your human potential and how you can develop further. Moreover, this method does not emphasise blind belief in, rather than understanding of, metaphysical processes. However, whether you are religious or non- religious, or a believer or a non-believer, the important thing is to know the nature of your own mind.\r\n\r\nApp Features:\r\n\r\n- Regular Updates \r\n- In-depth guide & explanations\r\n- Easy to read & follow\r\n- Buddhism FAQ",

        "description": "Dr. Norman Vincent Peale is a renowned author best known for The Power of Positive Thinking, his bestseller which has sold over 5 million copies. The Power of Positive Thinking is a classic that pioneered the idea of positive thinking and the power of the mind.\r\n\r\nIn this book, Dr. Norman teaches you how to get a hold of your life by believing in yourself, change your attitudes and adopt positive thinking and faith for all successes. Here is The Power of Positive Thinking summary that highlights his teachings chapter after chapter.\r\n\r\nBelieve in Yourself ‚Äì  ‚ÄúBelieve in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble yet reasonable confidence in your own powers, you cannot be successful or happy. But with self-confidence, you can succeed. A sense of inadequacy interferes with the attainment of your hopes, but self-confidence leads to self-realization and achievement.‚Äù\r\n\r\n\r\nA Peaceful Mind Generates Power ‚Äì  to draw power from your mind you need to have a peaceful mind. You can do this by practicing silence and passing calm and positive thoughts through your mind. ‚ÄúSaturate your thoughts with peaceful experiences, peaceful words, and ideas, and ultimately you will have a storehouse of peace-producing experiences to which you may turn for refreshment and renewal of your spirit. It will be a vast source of power.‚Äù\r\n\r\nHow to Have Constant Energy ‚Äì the thoughts that you feed your mind become what your body is really experiencing physically. If your mind tells you that you are tired, your body accepts that fact, and you feel tired. To be in a state of constant energy, you need to supply attitudes of faith to the mind. \r\n\r\nTry Prayer Power ‚Äì  You should also adopt prayer in your life, so you are able to open your mind to God. You can use any method that allows you to be free and open up your mind to God. Dr. Norman states that ‚ÄúYou are dealing with the most tremendous power in the world when you pray.‚Äù\r\n\r\nHow to Create Your Own Happiness ‚Äì  You are the only one who decides whether you will be happy or not and your happiness is determined by your thoughts. \r\n‚ÄúMany of us manufacture our own unhappiness. Of course, not all unhappiness is self-created, for social conditions are responsible for not a few of our woes. Yet, to a large extent, by our thoughts and attitudes, we distill out of the ingredients of life either happiness or unhappiness for ourselves. Anyone who desires it, who wills it and who learns and applies the right formula may become a happy person.‚Äù\r\n\r\nExpect the Best and Get It ‚Äì  ‚ÄúWhen you expect the best, you release a magnetic force in your mind which by a law of attraction tends to bring the best to you.‚Äù However, Dr. Norman states that this doesn‚Äôt mean that everything you will necessarily get everything that you want. It means that when you believe you can get everything you want, it comes to the realm of possibility for you.\r\n\r\nI Don‚Äôt Believe in Defeat ‚Äì  most of the obstacles that stand in your way are mental obstacles. You can be able to get through all of the problems that life throws at you with ease if you free your mind to remove the mental hurdles.  You, therefore, do not have to think about defeat, instead, think of the different possibilities you have to overcome a problem. Then with God, you will achieve what you want.\r\n\r\nHow to Break the Worry Habit ‚Äì  worry is a negative habit that develops but you were not born with. It is, therefore, possible to eliminate worry from your mind if you learn to empty your mind daily.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThe process of mind drainage is important in overcoming worry, for fear thoughts, unless drained off, can clog the mind and impede the flow of mental and spiritual power. But such thoughts can be emptied from the mind and will not accumulate if they are eliminated daily.‚Äù\r\n\r\nPower to Solve Personal Problems ‚Äì  if you want to be able to solve personal problems effectively, then you need to remember the fact that God is always with us.",

You might not even think of them as anxiety symptoms.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is a normal part of life and everybody feels it from time to time. However, when anxiety gets overwhelming and doesn't go away, it can be difficult to know how to manage it. By understanding what triggers your anxiety, you can develop strategies to cope.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is a normal human experience. It‚Äôs an emotion that drives us to study hard, work hard, and do better in our lives. But it can also make us overthink situations and paralyze us when we're faced with important decisions.

I'm getting premium for sure.",
            "i love this app. it has helped me a lot. it'd have been 5 stars if they let me re-read some of the entries i have answered from their prompts. as in right now the only thing i can re-read is the journal i wrote. but other than that, i'm so grateful i found this app. i'm considering to subscribe to the premium features because i genuinely want to support the dev team. props to them. thank you!",
            "It's beautifully designed and the ideas are good, but it rewards things that shouldn't always be rewarded, like productivity, for instance, because that's something we guilt ourselves for a lot. It's also extremely repetitive and there seems to be no variance, which makes it seem outdated and of limited use.",
            "The app is very immature in terms of development. It needs a lot more work to make it user friendly and useful. It gives the impression of being only half done, and released way too soon.",
            "The best app I have found! It really make me think and wonder how well I'm managing my emotions, the quotes, the writing, all of it."

Balancing this natural bias and building helpful thinking habits is shown to improve OCD beliefs and reduce symptoms.\r\n\r\nOCD, BELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self-talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us become more resilient.\r\n\r\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\r\nThe application is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts.\r\n3. Increase your access to helpful thoughts.\r\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes.\r\n5.

It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \r\n\r\nOCD AND THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self-talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes helpful thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\n\r\nAs you make helpful thinking a habit, this process becomes automatic and easier.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nWe believe mobile apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG OCD is designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND JOURNEYS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Complete a set of thoughts to finish the level.\r\nTo further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, some levels you complete are followed by a quick memory game.\r\n\r\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\r\n\r\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\r\n\r\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.\r\n\r\nDO I HAVE TO PURCHASE PREMIUM CONTENT?\r\nGG OCD is designed so you can enjoy the benefits of healthy self-talk without necessarily having to purchase anything.

        "comments": [
            "This app went from a concise OCD app to an unfocused all-in-one app that deals with too many topics in an unfocused fashion. The old app used to have a \"daily play\" option once you progressed through the \"levels\" that let you drop into the app for a nice summary of all the previous statements merged into one level. This doesn't seem to exist anymore. The app is clunky now. The only thing good about it is that the UI looks modern but everything else is trash.",
            "I have the full version and it's genuinely helpful for OCD, but it's also overpriced for how scarce the content is. Also, lots of misspelling errors exist in the app, which make it feel unprofessional especially when you're paying. I'd like to see the devs add around triple the content (more types of exercises and little games to help!) and correct the spelling mistakes. These are two big issues, but I would still recommend the free version to people for calming from OCD caused anxiety attacks.",
            "It's not the most helpful app ever but does kill time and in the moment helps you say nice things to yourself. Worth a shot if you dont know what to say to yourself but doesnt really help to implement those behaviors. Feels more like studying flash cards for a test before learning the material if that makes any sense.",
            "Great app! I do not focus on how fast i go through it, but work to internalize some of the advice as different way of viewing things... One of my fav sayongs is - feeling pass, change, and transform..... Would also be nice if the app included mental compulsions, such as analyzing and reassurance in the assessment... Also, could use an update on a few spelling errors.",
            "Great app! Simple and intuitive but effective. One recommendation: please enable users to proceed to the next level although time limit was exceeded. Personally I like to take time to reflect on each message instead of rushing through them. I believe many others would do the same. Do that and it'll be 5 stars!"

We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",

I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq üôèüôè",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think ¬£50 for 30 minutes and ¬£100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like ¬£49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. ¬£99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for ¬£70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened üòî. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",

Anyone in the academic community could tell you that this is damaging and encourages you to read silly trash articles that won't help you.",

            "Very powerful app! I'm recovering from many years of drug abuse. Haven't really felt what I should feel in a long time, and have been battling my own emotions for some time. I have been meditating on my own from time to time, during the short prison sentences I've served, which has given me relief up to a point. This ap, on the other hand, helps me in ways that, as of yet, nothing else has. I have a hard time focusing and my mind wanders easily but this all helps me with that.",
            "Far too expensive for what it is. A monthly subscription tier would be much more suitable than shelling out nearly ¬£100 after 7 free days. No one has that sort of money to burn straight away on an app",
            "Very good app with minor glitches, the idea , what the app provides is excellent this is what I paid for . You will rarely find an app that is perfect which I always make allowances for when I purchase. However in these challenging times and if you want to focus on bringing some relief to your life I recommend this app . It can crash a bit to much but this has not stopped me following the course , maybe it's got to much content but for me I put health and wellbeing above anything .",
            "I have just downloaded the app and only listened to one recording, it sounds amazing and I'm sure I would have a good experience if I decided to purchase it. One thing I find absolutely unacceptable though - why do you keep telling, within the app or in communication I received so far - that my \"free recordings are on the way\". This is far from being free! Why do you base your marketing on a lie? It's ridiculous and I can't think seriously about a company who doesn't take me seriously as well.",
            "I realise that others have found Synctuition a very positive experience but it was not for me. I stuck with it for a number of months because I'd paid a lot for the subscription and was hoping that things would change as I worked through the levels. Unfortunately they did not. I found the commentaries annoying and the binaural effects hard to discern. If you think that this is for you stick with the free samples. An expensive mistake for me !!!!"

Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps.

        "version": "5.1.4",
        "recentChanges": "Meet the new generation of Replika avatars! With this update we‚Äôre not only introducing the new look but also more options for customization. Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

The app is also shutting down in between reading news. Only false promises from the developers to fix the problems. But no solutions.",
            "No words to describe this app. Instead of downloading the different apps of the respective channels downloading this one app is enough. Yes, it has everything. I have a suggestion- please include an option to receive the notification of all the pages or channels we follow whenever they put on their new posts, now we just receive notifications of only priority news which is okay; still the former would be better & best- if u include notifications from both priority news and the pages we follow.üòò",

I can't stop myself loving this app. I love to read about latest updates, trending and current affairs. The best thing about Daillyhunt application is that all of my reading things are available on this app.",
            "It was good,but it still need things to be upgraded,Altogether it's fun and would look for betterment going forward.Please make sure there won't be any deceptive ads. It's really frustrating and annoying,the best part of the app is you get everything here rather downloading too many.",

Update: I keep getting red flagged and keep getting asked to verify over and over again even though I had several times. This is so stupid. Update again: they won't let me come back in! Saying I need to change passwords but they won't let me! Horrible site. I'm deleting forever and telling others to never use this site.",

I have already proved I'm one hundred percent real but this time I am trying to verify no matter what I do it's not letting me. I don't want to lose my account because I have many people I talk with. Ridiculous. The biometric is stupid and should be updated.",

I've been asked to verify twice in one week. The most recent time I was verified by picture then it asked me to change my password. Problem is I signed up with Facebook and therefore do not use a password to log in. I emailed a few times trying to resolve this issue and still am locked out.",

            "I love the app! Thanks to the purchased version, I get access to all of the valuable contents and it's full potential. The only downside in my opinion, is three fold. 1. It seems like the chat text box has a limited display capacity which cuts part of the information I or the bot coach send. 2. There are few syntax/spelling mistakes. 3. The content is very directive, which can bother some people, although you can still take advantage of this way of interacting and get a maximum of information.",
            "Free content is very mediocre.. Happy to spend the asking price if it's good but not convinced by the demo content. AI chat seems unspecific, tends to just say \"how would you describe your mindstate to someone else\" .. Chat can be a little patronising, maybe ease back on the emojis a little. Maybe i expect too much but not going to fork out my hard earned based on reviews. A couple of days full access would be more convincing, if indeed the service is good.",
            "5 stars all day, all the way!Little did I suspect that on my first day of playing with an app that I would make a huge self-discovery that people have been on me about since I was a kid. Who would have thought that talking to an AI App would create a MAJOR breakthrough in some issues Ive been beating around the bush about since I was a child. Absolutely AMAZING!These people have convinced me to pay the $7 a month that they want to teach me how to take control of my life!! Yes! Yes! Yes!",
            "NO where under the app name does it say \"in-app purchases\", no where in the description does it say \"in app purchases /monthly fee\", and no where at the very bottom in the app size area does it have the cost LISTED. Makes you believe you get everything for FREE then BAM \"you can't access this in the free part of this app\". Rotten company to bait & switch like that just to up their download count. VERY deceptive & horrible to do. $7 a month, sure, BUT YOU GOTTA POST THAT INFO HERE.",
            "Having suffered from low self-esteem, major clinical depression and severe anxiety for many years due to PMDD, fibromyalgia and considerable stress over the years, I have to say that this app is remarkably good at making me think about my feelings, my experiences and how to turn the feelings into positives, wherever possible. I've not paid for the full features yet but I'm really considering it. Really impressed by the app thus far! Great work folks!!!"

            "I loved the app until it started draining my battery. And when I did a maintenance to make it stop draining the battery, the app stopped working altogether. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling in order to make the app work. Then it starts draining my battery again. That sucks! First edition that I installed prior to this new one did not do that.",
            "Ive been using this app for years. This app used to open the screen automatically with the \"STOP\" button at the bottom when the alarm went off. Now the alarm goes off and nothing comes up on the screen anymore, I have to open the app and wade through the ads before I can open the alarm itself and turn it off. About 30 to 45 seconds of the alarm bells ringing before silence. Not feeling this at 0500 anymore. Please fix this issue. Im about to switch apps.",
            "A good app, I am considering buying the full version when I have a decent phone. The only thing I would add/change is the 'Fade in' time; it would be ideal to have an option to adjust the 'fade in' time. Personally, I prefer to have the alarm 'fade in' period set at 5 minutes: the current 'fade in' setting does not give me enough time to switch off the alarm calm and collected, instead I fumble and create a noise waking everyone up. Having said that, it is still a good app.",
            "It works really great as an alarm clock and it's the only one that can wake me up but it's super glitchy. Like sometimes alarms won't go off and sometimes alarms will go off at random times. Sometimes alarms will go off at the wrong time so my experience it works well as an alarm clock and it can wake you up amazingly but is super glitchy.",
            "Pretty intuitive. Only cons - lots of ads & notifications drop bar says wrong day (for the alarm) sometimes. Ex: I set an alarm last night, for the following morning; woke up prior to the alarm going off and in the pull down, the alarm says: \"next alarm set for tomorrow at 7:45.\" (When in actuality, it is only hours away, not over 24 hours away..)"

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables.

Save yourself from frustration.",

So I tried once more to add a person to my family tree that they had recommended and it still tells me to upgrade so what the hell is the 129.00 for ? Now I am in a dispute to get my money back that should never had been taken. They suck and I actually rate them negative 10 stars !",
            "The site makes it hard to cancel the free description. They make u go thru 4-5 pages & u have to fill out your information & number & keep asking over & over for extra confirmation to cancel the free trial. That's so aggravating. Also, the site didn't show my family in Costa Rica, seems like it only can search in the United States.",

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Something is wrong with this game. Almost nothing works and I can't even tell what most things are supposed to be. There are no instructions. No labels on buttons. I was able to find a few buttons that did something among all of the different screens but that's it. One dramatically increased the coins per tap. I then tapped for quite a while to see if somethijg, anything, would happen. Nope. Especially frustrating as the buttons do behave like they are working. Art style is nice, unique.",
            "Itd be neat if there was a button that stops the story slides every time you reset Also (might be my phone not sure) I cant always access the leaderboards Also I think the pets and or backgrounds shouldnt get repeated unless having multiple give some boost another thing it would be nice if master beggar stayed active or paused or maybe like half speed when you go over to other tabs rather than just not letting you go to other tabs and a master beggar upgrade that costs gold potions would be cool",
            "Good app. The grammar is a little bit bad. Not all. Please make a free coins by watching ads. Also the potion. Please 5 or 3 potion per ads pls. Thankyou. Your apps is good. Edit: TY for reply. Hm I also want to ask if can you please make a button where we can on and off the thing below the trainer, i mean the option. So we can play it full screen. Its hard to click when phone is small. Please. I really really love your app. Im willing to watch ads to support you guys. Hehe. Staysafe!",
            "Amazing game! I've spent about $45 on it and I have to say it was money well spent. The grammar's a bit off, but I believe it's the translation. It's a tapping game, you can earn potions to benefit you (or buy them), you can hire people once you get enough coins to get money for you, you can customize your character, the background, and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Overall, really great game!"

        "description": "Wish to build confidence and have higher self esteem? Want to learn how to become more successful and enjoy the power of inner-dialogue?\r\n\r\nIMPROVING CONFIDENCE IS SIMPLE\r\nThrow away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your self esteem and wellness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk ‚Äì individuals‚Äô ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, and maladaptive behaviours. \r\n\r\nHOW DO I BUILD MY CONFIDENCE\r\nThe foundations of healthy confidence and self esteem are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \"everything in my life needs to be prefect\", I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my confidence will decrease.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. With daily affirmations, we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk. We can change our beliefs and get rid of thinking patterns that negatively affect our confidence and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nHOW GG SELF-ESTEEM WORKS\r\nThe app is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thoughts\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts\r\n3. Increase your daily access to affirmations and positive thoughts\r\n4. Increase the automaticity of helpful thinking\r\n5. Provide daily affirmations for confidence and self-esteem boost\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \r\n\r\nKNOW YOUR THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your confidence, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nBEGIN YOUR JOURNEY\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 500 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Users are required to complete a random set of 'thoughts' to complete the level.\r\nTo further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, each level the player completes is followed by a memory game in which one has to identify a supportive statements that appeared in the previous level.\r\n\r\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty, fear of abandonment, and more.\r\n\r\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\r\n\r\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I COMPLETED ALL THE LEVELS\r\nThe key to using the app is learning new topics, but even more importantly - training daily. There are levels designed as \"daily training\" for you to play once you completed your base course.\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS\r\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\r\n\r\nOTHER APPS BY GG\r\nGG Self Care\r\nGG OCD\r\nGGBI: Body Image Distress & Preoccupation\r\nGood Blocks",

            "I purchased the full version of the original app for ~¬£15 (which guaranteed lifetime access) , which I found quite helpful. I was highly disappointed to find out that the original app is no longer on my phone and has instead been replaced by an app that charges a monthly subscription. Fair enough if the creators want to follow this model but I do find it very unfair that the early adopters who paid full price for the original app no longer have access to it.",
            "Updated review: The previous version was very good and I was finding it very useful. The new update locked the app for me again despite having purchased a full unlock and all my progress was lost. But I got help from a developer to unlock the app again and I will try the new one now from the beginning and see how it works for me.",
            "I paid for the full version (which guaranteed lifetime access) before they updated it. Now they're saying I have to pay monthly? This feels like a scam and could potentially damage people who they've once helped. This is dangerous",
            "I like this app, but it only let's you do three exercises a day, and no other way to practice during the day without having to start all over and then you find again at some point, you have to stop at three exercises. They need to have better instructions. There should be a clearly explained way to practice any time you want, as well as do the 3 main exercises a day.",
            "A nice app, but I didn't get a feeling or indication from the app that it was going to be helpful and it's already asking for money. I hope you will let people see more of the app to understand what is happening with the questions we're answering and how everything works, and if it works. Still skeptical, just haven't seen enough yet. Thanks for letting me try it out!"

            "I love the Kindle app! Never thought I would read e-books because I prefer to read a physical copy, but with covid and recently down sizing e-books are so much easier to read, and store! They take up no space. Best of all with the free Kindle app you can read books for free. Other books do cost but you do not have to buy anything to be able to read! Book lovers need this app!",
            "This app is well done as expected from Amazon. However, my biggest frustration is that highlighting is based on whole words and not characters. There are times where I will need to highlight one word and the current highlighting system makes it impossible without highlighting other objects around it. There are apps that allow for character based highlighting. Please change this and I will change my review to 5 stars.",
            "Bug-ridden garbage. Latest update 28/1/19 just marked all my books as new & unread when most of them should be partially or wholly read. So much for \"bug fixes\"! October 2020. There's an expression, \"If it ain't bust, don't fix it.\" Doesn't apply in this case. Definitely bust. Oh, and you'll need a magnifier to see the new Aa menu.",
            "The Kindle icon recently disappeared from my screen, so I reinstalled the app. The icon has re-appeared, but when I try to open any book from my library I get a message saying that Kindle has closed. Kindle no longer works on my device (Google Nexus). Does this have anything to do with the upgrade on 15th October ? If this isn't fixed soon I'm going to be asking for a refund for all the Kindle books in my library. Not happy.",
            "App itself is ok, latest update is hot garbage. Honestly I'm amazed they haven't hotfixed it yet, considering all the people who can't use the store at all right now. Pretty tired of getting push notifications, only to select them and get an error when it tries to display a store page. My other major annoyance at the moment - they decided to default to autoscroll instead of page flip, even when you've previously turned it off. How hard is it to just set it according to what the user specified?"

            "Bit Grindy but overall good but I prefer the first. It gets pretty boring after a little I suggest I little bit more action. Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",
            "Amazing idle game. It's like other idle games except it has buildings to purchase. A city you can go into with multiple things to do. And not filled with a ton of ads like Alot of other games. I personally love this game and the people who made it. Well that's all. Great game.",

Storage game data, view and manage google drive data, associate with personal info, see your personal info including your email address and your public data. Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live. Change it to cloud saves like every other idle game on the app store that is 4 stars and up.",

I cannot read the price for the upgrades, it is to hard to see (blue + green) Please make Blue and Red, I cannot read the price for part timers!!! please fix, will give 5! thank you"

            "To each their own, and I can only speak for me here. However, I love this app. I find it stimulations in areas, for me, that I haven't experienced yet or at least helps me to identify problem areas in which to manage them. I love that it is available. It makes me feel content in knowing that regardless of how I feel.. there's still some positive type of response for me to read or engage and thayd helpful.",
            "I guess it's an ok app/game. Pretty boring. All you do is swipe positive affirmations one way and negative ones the other way. There is no \"training\" or anything, no advice or tips or anything like that.",
            "I was initially embarrassed to try this app and asked myself why anyone would admit to needing this kind of thing by giving a review. But oh my goodness!! This app is wonderful. It conditions the mind to think positively and embrace resilience and that is a beautiful thing. My husband is trying it now, too, and likes it as well. It has helped me already to have a more positive outlook and improved the way I relate to others. I wouldn't have believed it without trying it. So grateful!!",
            "I've definitely seen improvement in managing my thoughts and it's really nice to see an app specifically for rocd. I'm docking a star simply because a $20 pay wall is extreme.",
            "I was unsure at first because some of the exercises *could* (potentially, in certain situations) make things more difficult, if the relationship is abusive, for instance. *HOWEVER*, assuming that the person using the app does not have an abusive partner and is aware of their own weaknesses, I have found this app to be helpful. It definitely helps with intrusive, obsessive thoughts that sometimes creep into my head for no reason. And it helps me keep my crazy under wraps, lol"

            "A terribly designed programs. Here is why: 1. Poor search function that requires exactly correct spelling for podcasts search. 2. Cuts the podcast off every 20 minutes so you have to restart the podcast constantly. On a 5 hours podcast that's 15 times. 3. Continues to play in the background even after being closed. Required a 'force stop' to cease activity. Edit: with notifications turned off, there is no mini player in the pull down android menu.",
            "Very convenient to organize/access podcasts, but unfortunately this app seems to cache podcasts in its user data space (not the usual cache space). This led to my phone running out of storage in a couple of weeks, causing all sorts of havoc and stress. It took me a while (after mistakenly blaming the Android OS) to trace the problem to this app - then finally, the used space dropped from Full to only 30% of 64 Gb!",
            "Great experience. Connects to my Bluetooth radio, and pauses and restarts when the Bluetooth connection is severed (turning car off and back on). I have not experienced any problems. You can download podcasts to listen without using data while commuting.",
            "Been on Podbean for 18 months and am EXTREMELY happy with them.We are the #1 Interactive Comedy Podcast because of them .PLUS you keep your content unlike other sites.Your guests or listeners can chat in live session along with you or call in thru the app. Podbean is the future of Podcasting available today.imho",

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

            "Quality just keeps going downhill. Seems like bugs get bigger with each update. Lately, when trying to locate another phone on our plan, it can only tell me the county that the phone is in - which is absolutely useless information. Other times, it can't locate the phone at all. AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",
            "App wont open, keep getting notifications saying the app is updating...been doing this for 3 days..why is it updating for 3 days....not able to use it at all. This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",
            "This app is terrible. Att Smart Limits was a much better app. Each time I unpause my sons internet access, he has to restart his phone for it allow him internet. Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying.

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

        "description": "ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßŸÇŸäÿßÿ™ ÿ£ÿ∞ŸÉÿßÿ±-Azkar AlBaqiyat\r\nAl-Azkar ‚Äì Hisn Al-Muslim represents a fortification for the Muslim which helps strengthening his relation with Allah, and guards him against the whisperings of Satan and conditions of soul.\r\nThe Prophet (peace be upon him) used to observe supplication when going in or out the house, while moving or setting and in all his actions.\r\nThe supplications include the acts concerning both this life and the hereafter. That is, there are supplications for every single act of work or worship to the extent that supplications fill the Muslim‚Äôs life and surround it like a fortification.\r\nDue to the urgent need of Muslims, who adhere to the Prophetic Sunnah, for supplications, and to help them cope with the modern technology, Arabia for Information Technology, the leading company in the field of Islamic applications and software developing, has designed and developed Al-Baqiyat Application for mobile phones and smart devices (iPhone, iPad, Android) in many languages, using the latest programing technologies. This has been done under the generous sponsorship of the ‚ÄúWaqf of Badr Ibn Saleh Ar-Rajhi‚Äôs mother and her Sons‚Äù.\r\n Al-Baqiyat (Azkar) is an application aimed at displaying the supplications of the Qur‚Äôan and Sunnah through a user-friendly interactive interface which enables many unpreceded features and abilities.\r\nThe application was designed to be suitable for all users. One of its main advantages beside the broad range of services it offers to the users is that it adopts the well-known book of ‚ÄúHisn Al-Muslim: Invocations from the Qur‚Äôan and the Sunnah‚Äù by Sheikh Sa`id Ibn Ali Ibn Wahf Al-Qahtani, using various translations.\r\nContents:\r\n1.

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Nice interface. Though each type of device has a different user experience, (iOS, Android, MacOS), a little weird but each is still very good. I like the ability to add and subtract areas if interest. They mark ads/sponsored posts pretty well. Pretty speedy on all devices, even somewhat older ones. Overall a nice news agragator.",
            "I've been using flipboard for years. Now like 80% of the content is videos. And NONE of those videos actually play. It's so weird. They have some new video set up, every time I click on a video, it doesn't play. Just black screen. Click on it, it goes to another black screen. So, two major problems rendering this app useless: 1. Nearly all news is now in the form of videos. I don't want videos. I want to read, and 2. Those videos don't even work. How do you not beta test this, Flipboard??",
            "If I open a page on source like golf or mma or something like that, I get articles that cover something else entirely. I'm really annoyed that I spend more time reporting articles that are not on topic and I don't know why this hasn't changed in years of reporting these articles... Please do something about this.",
            "Been using flipboard for quite some time since you can customize what news you see or just flip through all news. Biggest down side is tbe comment section is really subpar and broken up into different sections. Dont even bother commenting if you see 100 plus comments because your comment is lost at the bottom. Other than that is a nice app to see any news you want.",
            "Can't share URL if you click a link inside an article. Steps to repro: 1. Tap into an article 2. Tap any link on the page that goes to a different site 3. Observe the top toolbar shrinks from several items to 2 items. 4. Tap the share button in that toolbar 5. Pick literally anything on share sheet. 6. See \"Couldn't Share item\" error every time. If you fix this bug lmk and I'll revise my review! Update: Flipboard denied this obvious, reproducible bug. Smh. Bug does not happen on ios."

            "I like this app. I really do. But I'm sorry, the watermark thing has to go. It's pointless, for what? Too much ads as well. I cant even download a pic without getting 2 or more ads. I can only download maybe like 5 pictures before my last watermark runs out. These two features are making my experience with this app lower. I understand the ads, advertising, I know. But too much ads. I just don't understand the watermark. Without the Watermark, I would've definitely rated this app 4 stars.",
            "Great app but it could be more useful if users were able to write articles with the app.",
            "Have been a user since 2014.. please stop this watermark thing no one does this it's insane I love this app but that's too much .. listen to your users. Thank you",
            "I have three suggestions: 1. Make your interface look better. It's a really early 2000s look going on and you can do better. 2. When you refresh your discover page it really does nothing but give you the same feed just with 3 or 4 new pictures at the top. I'm pretty sure you're not having a shortage of pictures or something so please improve upon this. 3. The watermark thing has to go. Period. Y'all wildin.",
            "I used to LOVE this app to the point I was a heartist for 3 years in a row, I had deleted it for a while to come back to it being a money pit; want to download so many pictures you have to buy a membership, don't want ads buy the membership, ect. its ridiculous, the app used to be a fun outlet for creativity and now half my pictures are under review and its things like plants and art, I really miss the way it used to be, dont bother getting it anymore unless you want to spend $$ over pictures üò¢"

            "This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like \"Download print issue\" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
            "I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
            "Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
            "App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
            "Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless."

            "I have loved this game and the play. But in the recent update and event, this has been a monumental failure. The new ranking system of pvp makes it more complicated to play with clan mates and it hasn't done anything to improve matchups. The new horde event with the collecting cards to gather coins to spend on weapons, heroes, and gear is just so complicated and frustrating. Why change something that worked for so long? The old way of milestones is so much better. Please go back to the old ways!",
            "Still a problem with PVP match ups!!!! Still too many cheaters, hackers and aim bots. And the match up algorithm is still a joke. Keep having to go against players with way more power. If you're on a win streak, magically you're going to have to face said cheaters, hackers and aim bots to knock your ranking back down. Been playing for almost 2 years and they still won't really fix this problem. I have too much money invested in this game to delete it. Oh well. Be warned.",
            "The new matchmaking system is just as terrible as the one before it. I have been playing the PVP since they introduced it and I have not gone beyond ranking 19 as I am constantly matched up against opponents far better than me, so nothing has changed besides the developers saying they have addressed an issue that so many gamers were unhappy with. And this new issue will take them years to sort out just like before. Steer clear of this game unless you are willing to spend lots of money.",
            "Great graphics good game except for the greedy pay to play system. This game also seem to have way too many server issues. Sometimes while I'm in the process of making a purchase it tells me I have been awarded the resources but it didn't actually happen. The devs will say it was added to my account when clearly it isn't. The match making system puts you up against players way more powerful than you are and you will often have to play against lame hackers that will not play fair.",
            "PVP is full of cheaters with hack codes, terrible system. Their servers lose connection nearly every day, multiple times, in the middle of a match causing you to lose. Extremely frustrating! If you love a game that the developers aim to beg for your wallet to get anything good to compete, well this game is for you!"

            "I enjoy the ability to listen to a book as I drive, the only to toddler-free time I have. I love the book exchange, so I can keep the books I truly love. It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "It's a good app. I like what Microsoft is going with it so far, with a productivity first approach. I would like to see some more customization options though, like App folder \"Covers\" in Action Launcher. You can have quick access to one app with a tap, while keeping the rest of the folders behind a swipe (or a long press). I like to keep a clean desktop, & that'd go a long way to cleaning clutter. I look forward to further updates & features.",
            "Just seems to make sense so far after all the others that just come close but ever just get there. I've tried every one of them. They just seem to leave one particular area unattended to. This one just seems to basically cover everything. I'm sticking with it until I see something better. It's a delicate balance between form and function. It cannot be just about one or the other alone. All the others looked cool and all but, they seemed to have been uncompleted somehow.",
            "I was bored of my system launcher after using it for 3 straight years. And eventually I came across Microsoft launcher and voila I loved it very much , it's very systematic and user friendly. There are few bugs and issues like \"Your feed\" doesn't load calendar events. But apart from that , it's the best launcher in the store.",
            "Absolutely love this!! I love how we can customise literally EVERYTHING been trying to look for something like this for so long and never would've thought Microsoft has a launcher and it is this good! I downloaded it initially so I can sync the clipboard for the stuff I copied and pasted Little did I know this launcher is actually this amazing My fav is that the \"subgrid\", \"your feed\" and that I can swip vertically for my home pages Anyways 5/5 for sure!!",
            "Absolutely brilliant. Clean simple and smooth. There is one thing I would like to see in a future update and that would be for an option to change the color of the gray overlay on left screen and the opacity. I personally would like to change this to a solid black to match my dark theme. Thank you for a wonderful launcher"

I typed it in right. It pretty frustrating when you need a ride and can't even access your lyft account for a ride. This has been going of for 2 years now.",
            "Up until tonight Ive loved the app, but as of tonight it charges me for the ride but after I go and order it it just goes back to the select destination screen it doesn't look for a car then it tells me I found a car and be ready in 18 minutes but there's no trace of it inside the app I don't know what's going on right now, I'm very disappointed and kind of stranded not because of this possibly unless this guy just shows up mysteriously in 18 minutes I have no clue if he's going to or not",
            "I have had an account for years but have not used it since 2015. I moved to a new state recently and had re-download lyft and tried to attach my payment methods. I tried to attach every option that is offered and the app wouldn't let me. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled several times. There's is no proper customer service set up. I finally found a number that would keep me on hold then eventually hang up. This is why I prefer uber, I never have these problems with them.",
            "Changed my address a week before downloading. My card didnt match my new address when adding it yet. Understandable. But now that my address is up to date, i still have to use a completely different card. I contacted support who told me my card wasnt working or they dont accept it _. I tried explaining it was my address, they sent me to a link that told me I need to use a new card. Its just very frustdrating. I gave it two stars because the drivers are always awesome and the prices are fair.",
            "Terrible. Added my credit card a day prior and thought it was set to go. Now I request a ride and they want a second credit card that has matching address, provided this unnecessary info and rejected because could not validate, your problem not mine. Dishonest, unreliable, do not use if your ride is a necessity. Unbelievable. 0 stars if I could"

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ‚ù§Ô∏è I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap üòâ ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "It really lacks a calendar view or better integration with Google Calendar (e.g. sync more than one project, add colors to tasks in Google Calendar according to labels or projects, etc.). Otherwise it has been great, I'm really enjoying the app! Sub tasks should show their parent in \"Next 7 Days\" and \"Today\", this would be super powerful for splitting a task over several days, it would be a game changer for me!",
            "The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great. Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
            "Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days.",
            "I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
            "Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again !"

Second of all, it gives you a food planning thing which is really healthy for our body. Third of all, it keeps track of your everyday workouts and your weight. I just really like this app, definitely should get it if you want to lose weight. üòä",
            "It's a great simple app to remind myself to do a little exercise every day. The workouts may seem easy to some, but I find they work muscles that are easily missed during typical weight lifting workouts. With a little know how, it'ss easy to modify the exercises to increase or decrease difficulty. Most of the moves can be performed with very little noise or jumping around. It gets a little monotonous after a few weeks.",
            "Very very very goood app. I live it. I has really worked on me. The coach this app. She is really very good. She gives us tip and directions of the exercise very well. She even mentions where to the exercise like in bed and stuff. I recommend it to every one who wishes ti get fit and loose weight. I swear it really works or effects on u. And the diet plan no words. I really appreciate it and thank u. Keep going.",
            "OMG ! This app is wonderful. First of all we can lose our weight without money. I could loss my weight easily with the instructions voice coach had told. If you follow the exercises correctly you can also find the changes. I will give this app 5 star because of the changes I found while I did the exercises. Thank you very much for Making this app wonderful."

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. üòÇ The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. üòÇ",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

            "This app has gotten so much worse than before. $45 for 1 month of Basic? It was at least 3 times cheaper than that barely a few months ago? And you only get to match like 8 people before you have to wait 16 hours versus the like 30 something people you used to be able to match. I won't be using this app until it is back to normal.",
            "I have been using this app for 5 years. I met most interesting people of my life here. But unfortunately lately it seems there is an active force to strip down OKCUPID from its beautiful and distinctive features. So the changes are often to make the application worse. Examples: sweep culture. Mixing all the questions which used to be separate groups. Now blending matches in so called \"your turn, their turn\"",
            "Read the reviews. This app is a money pit. When you first register, you'd be barraged with so many LIKES that you start thinking it just might work. The next thing you know, you're subscribed. Suddenly there aren't any more LIKES and the only ones you get are from places you specified you didn't want. What gives? Their 'match' algorithm is definitely off too and it would seem a lot of people are inactive users. Bottom line, don't download. Not worth the time or money.",
            "OKcupid used to be the best app to meet new people, for romance or friendship. However it regressed during the years into another boring swipe centred app. I used to be able to meet people which I had interests in common with, now you are locked into the 15 recommended profiles which you have to swipe if you want to get more, while before you could check out hundreds. Very disappointed in it. At least they should make the old layout available.",
            "It's ok, but not as good as it use to be, because now you can't browse, it's all swiping which is not what humans should be doing. It's turning into Tinder! Some of the questions are idiotic and totally unnecessary. App has bugs, you have to keep closing and clearing Ram for it to work properly, and the preferences don't work at all. It shows me women not in my age range or even distance, so it's pointless using the app. I have now deleted as it's not worth the time."

Very repetitive stories; news content very selective in coverage and is not changed rapidly enough. App indicates on its icon new news stories but when opened the user is not expedited to the new news stories; there is no personalization to filter out content that is less or not interesting to the user with focus on content of interest, not b.s.. CNN the channel is better.",

The button appeared once, I clicked it, but now all I see on my TV is the red CNN logo. Plus, what's up with the \"two screens\" display on the phone at the top? What is that for? So confusing.",
            "I have this app for breaking news alerts, but in the past couple of days I've been getting \"alerts\" about interviews and other CNN content. In my settings, I ONLY have breaking news selected. If this keeps happening I'll have to find a new breaking news app",
            "Not sure what's going on with the Android version of CNN. Videos don't work at times, links don't go to matching video from Home page on app. And when I open the app, it takes me back to the same article from weeks ago (even when I close the app, or all my app). I'm on a Note 10+ so not on an Android device. It worked bigger on my iPhone 7. Deleting and reading from there or on a browser. Bummer."

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "it WAS always accurate as far as forcast, current conditions, location, etc. However, for about the past month, it has been forcing a location that doesn't really exist. It has also had me in 3 different cities & states that i'm nowhere NEAR & this all happened within 15 mins while i was sitting in the same spot. I may have to delete this app because of this problem. Shame, i've used it for about 4 years & never had any issues. Always really liked it",
            "Since the last update, I have to keep reloading the live wallpaper (which is the main function I was interested in). It just keeps crashing, whereas it used to work perfectly. What a shame. Now the app forces location permission (you used to be able to select the city you wanted the weather for) - if you don't provide permission the app is unusable because it keeps flashing the permission request on the screen and won't respond.",
            "Constant. repititous, anoying alerts. mostly at midnight. through 3 am! App does not give historical temps, etc. Inaccuweather in the news paper and on tv don't give it either unless it sets a record. Since shuting off notifications during the night for ALL apps I am no longer bothered with annoying alerts. Still I would like to see historical data on the app. Going back just a week would be a huge improvement.",
            "Inaccurate weather and the widget flakes out 2 or 3 times a day. This USED TO BE a great weather app, but I'm having to get my weather info from somewhere else. And the widget looked amazing on my home screen, but I don't like seeing the \"thinking wheel\" when there's supposed to be a live representation of the weather outside. Extremely disappointing to say the least.",
            "Just because she's \"pretty\" won't necessarily mean she's \"wife material\": I wanted to love this app (esp. after being recommended by one of the premiere online Tech Review sites), but after only 1/2 day of being persistently bombarded with annoying in-your-face \"nagware\" for BASIC forcast information we can grab less painfully from any number of \"generic\" weather apps, I'm DELETING it from my device ~ which is a shame, bec. it does have a number of appealing features, just not enough to save it!"

I then called for the 2nd time requesting an appt in the evening and was told the latest appt was 1230... all advertisement says appt as late as 7 pm. Asked if I could book for Nov bc all late appts were already booked but they don't do appointments until last week of Oct for nov. Was previously told that for oct but when called all evening appts were booked. This company is a joke!",

            "My experience has been awful. After the 1 month free premium trial I tried to cancel my subscription it would not let me. Day 6 of trying to get a refund, countless hours spent on the 'live chat' feature which kicks you off every 3 minutes. Emailed them with link below. Haven't heard anything yet. This is incredibky disappointing and shows that I cannot support this company with my money as it seems impossible to speak to someone or get an issue resolved. Utterly disappointing customer service.",
            "For a professional tool, there are way too many bugs. For instance, when someone sends us a connection request, we can't click to see their picture. It simply doesn't open. Same thing happens with replying to their message. Unless we accept the connection, go back and enter into the person's profile properly, many features don't work. Sometimes the app needs to be restarted in order for it to start working again. A month after this review still no info from the developers team... Disappointing.",
            "I really like LinkedIn app but I guess your app is couple of steps behind your website. Watching live events on the app is just like being tortured! Comments cover the screen in landscape mode, and if you want to turn it back to portrait mode, the screen becomes too small that makes it impossible to read a single word! Would you please fix it ASAP?",
            "The app is useless for the last few days. I'm following a highly active community on LinkedIn. But same posts from 3-4 days back is always there on top of my feed. No matter how much I refresh the feed, new posts won't appear. I tried everything from clearing cache to reinstalling the app. The feed is like my profile now. There are posts I've liked and commented. Even if there are no new activities on the post by my connection, it's still there.",
            "It will be nice if you were able to edit a conversation piece that you accidentally sent that had mistakes, and that you wanted to correct or unsend. Example if you were sending date each text message (case in point this a speech to text) and there a lot of errors in it. Then you accidentally send it. You can't unsend it. It should be a way to fix an error after it's been sent or unsend something."

            "Been using it for a little over a month or so. I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or \"extra features\" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",
            "Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!",
            "This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",
            "I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",
            "I like this app and I appreciate it. Just I have paid $2.99 for ads-removed from the app but the app still shows the ads and ask me to pay again for removing Ads!! I have already sent an email to the developer but I didn't get the response! I'm waiting for your reply as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and support. (UPDATE) I solved this issue by reinstalling the app. Thank you."

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.üôèüôè",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "Very confusing. Every time I try to login I have to change my password. Takes me forever to accomplish anything with ATT. I uninstalled this app, could not get it to let me in. Wanted a wireless number that I do not have. All I want to do is pay my bills. I go through some kind of B.S. every month. Between being on the phone and using the simple AT&T app I have been at this for well over an hour, and still have not paid my bill. Ridiculous!",
            "Update: Originally I could never pay my bill with the app. I always had to call in and explain the difficulties each time. The last 2 or 3 payments have been made so smoothly I would have to say this is now one of the better apps I use. Thanks for fixing all of the issues I have noticed. Original post: This app is absolutely junk. I have so much difficulty with paying my bill each and every month. It just sits there spinning gaining no traction.",
            "I don't really know how good this works. It seems to be working a little bit better now, but it is still having problems remembering my USER ID AND PASSWORD. OH Well, I really hope that is just temporary. On one page it thinks it's 1 thing and on another page it thinks they are something else. For the third time, THIS APP OFFICIALLY STILL WON'T LET ME SIGN IN!üò†üò†üò°üò§ OTHER than that I guess it's ok.",
            "Its been 2 months that me and my wife switched from Verizon to ATT, and yet have been able to get login into an online account. We have spent many hours trying to get this resolved with att and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue, still to this day nothing has been done. The customer service is very unprofessional, and possibly undertrained. I've never had such issues with Verizon and Verizon service is always top notch. Will be back with Verizon after our two years are up.",
            "This app is garbage. You would think AT&T would be sure the app was functioning properly so people could spend money with them, open new accounts, etc., But instead this app literally never works right. It always crashes. It's just garbage. Which reflects AT&T well because none of their stuff ever works. Their service is garbage. And their CUSTOMER SERVICE is even worse. This is so sub par. Verizon is far superior in every way. Unfortunately I live in the woods and AT&T is only one that works"

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

I'm not sure how this app got any five-star reviews not going to lie. if anyone is able to use this app and it's helpful to them in any way, I would love to know your secret.",
            "This app is sooo buggy and nothing has changed for the 3 years I've been a customer! Can't update any profile information ever, it's so annoying. One way or another something is going to glitch out and you won't be able to finish your task or it won't recognize it or won't load the page or whatever. Wish I could just delete it off my phone...",
            "I am satisfied with my service there are no hidden fees or added charges each month. My bill is consistent and that is what I wanted, other networks raised my monthly bill without communicating with me and it caused a financial hardship for me. The T- mobile app is user friendly and easy to navigate. I am very happy with my T-Mobile network service and I would recommend T-Mobile to my friends and family over any other network out on the market today.",
            "I love the T-Mobile app. When I put my new SIM card in my phone, it was not activated yet and I could not make phone calls, but I was able to use the T-Mobile app to live chat with a representative who activated my SIM card for me. Thanks T-mobile! There are also many other things that you can do using the app including lots of information about your account.",
            "Any other app would get 3-4 stars, but T-Mpbil4 has excellent standards and Ledger exclusive customer experiences across almost the entire board except with this app. In one word, this app is CLUNKY. Processes move slow, 2-step verification can close the app out, any smoothness you have is totally lost w/ pop up or split screen and navigation feels like traversing the wreckage of a 4-app collision. Note 10+ 5G this is not hardware issue. 1 star only to bring it to yalls attentjon"

Also, it takes longer to move from one folder to another.

I am a bit sorry I updated.",

Now, whenever you open the folders list, you're at the beginning of the list and the first folder. So each time you have to repeatedly scroll to the proper folder. I also don't like the links to similar emails that appear at the top of each email. You have to scroll down to see the email message. Put em at the bottom.",

App is taking forever to update and replicate on Samsung S2 Tablet. Never had this issue on the 'old' application. The S20 phone doesn't seem to have a problem other than continually trying to load. It's is not a network or wifi issue."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "Thank you so much team! Bcs I searched a lot for home delivery of such products but most of them didn't meet my expectations. Some may be having problems with delivering to this particular location but coming to this app, it changed everything. It was quite difficult to be calm for not having fish for more than 3-4 months; even if I went to market I couldn't find the ones which we use to have! This app provides at least few from our list. The delivery is also good; no complaints! Best Wishes ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "Good App, No Technical issues, and Excellent delivery. But the packing could be made mess free. After multiple instances of leaking package, I've stopped ordering. Very very careless packaging. Most of the time the seal breaks and water(smelly) leaks out.",
            "On time delivery and good quality of ordered items. Reasonable price compared to other apps. Lots of love Fresh to home ‚ù§ Only one suggestion is, try to make it available of 90 min delivery for all items!! Because sometimes customers look for particular item but no option of 90 min delivery which makes them to turn to another app!! All the best team üëç",
            "Since no 4.5 rated it 4. Prompt in delivery and good quality. I did not use the app for long time due to negative reports about the App. For placing order it works very well. Yes offers like ADCB it doesnot work. Value for money for sure.. Dont compare it with deals and offers apps. The products are quality based. Certain quality products r slightly high. . 100% Value for Money. I have been buying for last 2 months. I use it almost daily basis. Worth trying it. Cut meats r excellent.",
            "Really good and user friendly app. It's a good app and it has More than 500+ varieties of groceries and milk and dairy products to choose from. and also it has Customizable subscription. i love the most is NO delivery charges and NO minimum order value. Feels great to share this experience :)and delivered a order before 7:30"

            "Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from \"my day\". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!",
            "For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",
            "Redudant and limiting. There should be a way to share specific lists, but keep some private-a \"Honey-Do\"list; to be able to schedule minders for the 3rd level items and further break down tasks; to be able to reorder 3rd level sending completed to bottom; to be able to prioritize which list I want at the top and if I don't use Important, Planned, Tasks, then I want to move it down and pin what I want on top; to be able to set custom alarms, not notifications, for very important things...",
            "Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",
            "Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an \"assigned to me\" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."

            "Was my favorite app for months, but: Problems in standby/offline mode: - In group chat you don't receive notification any more. Moreover, the chat is not saved for you, so it's lost if you are offline for a while. - Notification are displayed after two messages are received from someone. You need to send \"Hello\" twice. I'm using it with my friends. I thought it can not be any better.",
            "Keeps disconnecting even tho we are sitting infront of our router and high wifi signal. But stll app drops? 4 star. Fix the dropp issue and I give it 5*.",
            "Does not work offline as advertised. At least through social media. The person that told me about this app said that it could work like a true walkie talkie. But it needs internet or towers. Which defeats the purpose of using it like a walkie talkie. Maybe one day we will get an app that doesn't need internet, bluetooth, wifi or towers. But it's not today, and not with this app. For what it's worth, with towers, internet and bluetooth it's an excellent app truly.",
            "Use to be good. I think with there paid version now the free one is not even back burner worthy to them. Good luck with customer support. Last couple if uodates now make a bluetooth mic useless and no way to fix it nor will they respond on how to. Update Over a month and still no response to inquery as to why zello is messed up when usinh a bluetoothe device. Have 2 different units and it does same on both which means a zello issue. But i am not a buisiness class user so it doesnt matter to them"

So I don't know exactly what they said and I don't understand üòê cause of the translator. Please fix these issues üôÇ",
            "This app is really good. It's a great source to communicate with our favorite idols and our idols can also share their moments with us. I will give this app 5 stars but the problem is translation . The translations are weird. Sometimes it makes zero sense. Which is a problem for the international fans as most of them don't speak Korean. So, in my humble opinion they should work a little more to update the translation system.",
            "Sadly this app keeps getting worse by the day. I cannot comment on anything. Nothing will translate because the servers are always busy. I continually get an network connection error, even though I am practically sitting next to my modem. I am also having issues watching items I have purchased without receiving an error message and the video will not play. These are just some of the many issues myself and others are dealing with. Please fix this.",
            "Perfect app for BTS followers! A platform which connects BTS and army together. It allows you to interact with your idols as well as other fans. The only problem I face is of the translator. Some translations get wrong and changes the entire meaning. Apart from the translator, this app is amazing. Let the tie get more stronger with weverse.",
            "I really like this app. There's one feature that I'd like it to have and that is, an option to delete selective notifications. For example, if I post something then I would obviously like to know who cheered or commented on my post. But after sometime, it becomes irrelevant. So I'd want to be able to select the notifs that I don't want and delete them. This way, I can get rid of the unwanted notifs and can keep in updated with the artist posts and their new comeback announcements etc."

            "Was working great but I didn't realize it was blocking phone calls from doctor's office, and similar places. No option to program it not to block those numbers so I have to turn the blocking off. Also everything prompts you to go premium...I thought the last uncarrier move said this would be free? Now it just feels like a additional ploy to get money out of us...sneaky.",
            "It's been a long time coming for this app and finally its here Thank you T-mobile I no longer have to go through phone call after phone call. I would get more phone calls from scammers more than my own personal calls on a daily I never wanted to answer my phone cause I just knew it was probably a scam of some sort I can't explain how annoying that is. So thank you so very much T-mobile....",
            "**Response to developer: Scam block is already turned on, it just doesn't work very well. Make the app better instead of blaming your customers please.** Doesn't block very many calls, but has blocked calls from contacts. That can be fixed by adding them to favorites, but it's still annoying. I liked it better when the TMobile system would say \"scam likely\" which seems to have been discontinued after this app launched. It sounds good but doesn't work very well.",
            "Useless, reroutes spam callers to voicemail. Basic app notifications are locked behind paywall. Just download Google Phone cause unlike this it's free, it works, and you can mark callers as spam from the phone app immediately, unlike this where you wait hours . App has a problem where voicemail calls and unknown numbers call don't appear, so you cannot mark them as spam. The entirety of this should be free for all T-Mobile customers. Better yet opensoure it, so people can fix it.",
            "At first this worked great. I wasn't getting any calls that ever said scam likely. Until the last few weeks I have been receiving four or five calls a day from a number that has the same area code and prefix as my number. I block the number, just to get another call from the same area code and prefix. Of course I don't answer. I block, they change the last four digits in their number and call again within 10 minutes."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "This app seems to be littered with dozens, if not, hundreds of ads that have been up for, in some cases, over 2 years. I sent one a message asking if it was available, and didn't receive a reply. After seeing that the ad was still posted, I also noticed that it was posted 2 years ago. I saw a few other listings that had the same story. I liked how LetGo didn't leave listings over a couple months old without asking the lister if it was still relevant.",
            "This app is far less usable than Letgo was. The second I click on one thing to see what it is, I am immediately bombarded with listings of similar items from ebay. If I wanted to look on ebay, I would use that app. Don't assume I need to see 20 of that item. Prices aren't listed in the browse page so I have to click to find them. And when something sells, it doesn't disappear. It just stays with the other listings and says \"Sold\". I dont need to see all the things I cannot buy.",
            "Over 70% of the messages you will get will be fraudulent scams (they are quite obvious, but it's annoying to deal with). There is not much support for when you have issues with the app and I kept getting my posts removed for items being \"intangible\", which was not true, had photos and descriptions of actual items and there was nothing I could do about it, so it just became pointless and frustrating to use. Stick with FB marketplace or CL or other platforms",
            "Titles, descriptions, and prices of items are not shown in search results, leading me to click a bunch of images only to see that the item is not what I want or out of my price range. PLEASE add titles and prices to search results page. Also the gallery of pictures that are not in any order or in one grid make it confusing to look through listings. I don't get what the intent is... To have me looking through the app forever and never finding what I am looking to buy???? Please fix the UX.",
            "The app already sucked, but now it's worse. Why would you combine 2 apps and not take the good from the other app? To many old listings, nothing expires. Messaging is a joke, you're better off talking to the wall. An speaking of messages, how can I sell something if I dont get notified? To many times I've had to open the app just to see multiple messages, days old, and the buyer long gone, thanks offer up. I remember when this app came out, that was its prime, now it's just garbage."

        "comments": [
            "Love Outlook! Always have! I've used other formats & platforms over the years, when working at someone else's house or office, or using equipment not my own, but nothing has ever come close to matching the complete package that is Outlook. It's extremely user friendly & even the tech-challenged can usually sort their way through pretty much any function, with relative ease. I have always used Outlook & at 55 years old, don't imagine I'll be changing anytime soon.",
            "I use this for work. There is often an extremely long delay between getting a notification for an email and actually being able to view it. The email will be instantly available in Outlook online, but can take up to 5 minutes to load in mobile. The app sends notifications for meetings 15 minutes in advance, but clearing the notification in any way just results in the app resending the notification. Oh, it does the same thing with \"meeting has ended\" notifications. Atrocious app design.",
            "On my old Samsung phone I had the outlook app and NEVER had problems with it. I have had a new phone for 2 weeks and this app has had endless problems. It freezes, it doesn't load emails, it won't send emails and every variation in between. I have followed online suggestions to clear the cache and data and yes the problem is solved for no more than 1 day. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app and again the problem is solved for a day and then back to having the same issues. Woeful!",
            "Whilst I love the features of Ms Outlook, the app has pitfalls. I will receive a notification of a new email, click to review said email and it will be no where to be found. Refresh, refresh, nothing! However, if I go on the desktop web version I will see everything as it is to date. ... This app defeats the purpose of having a mobile service if I always have to draw for my laptop to review emails.",
            "This version of Outlook (mobile, Android) seems appropriately scaled down to suit small screen and \"keyboard\" use and appears to have been optimised for email. Most (or maybe all?) of its original functionality is there, but some features might need a bit of hunting, until you learn how to find them. . Great to be able to use full strength email via phone, with that robust corporate look & feel that Outlook is known for."

I tried everything, deleting and reinstalling, updating, restarting my phone, logged out and in. Still doesn't work. My wifi is also perfectly fine with other apps and webs.",
            "This works ok. I been getting annoyed because I don't always get a notification that I got a message. For example ill randomly open it and than it will tell me I got a message a few hours back im like WTH it's supposed to tell me when I get it. You guys need to fix that issue it happens too often",
            "It works most of the time, what irritates me is the lack of fluidity of the performance given by the app when using it even on the highest-end devices. Other third-party apps on my phone works fine, smooth like butter except LINE, it stutters frequently without any explanations or whatsoever. I hope this can be fixed in the future. And I also hope that it will be more optimized for tablets because, I cant use the app on landscape mode except in chats....which is.... odd.",
            "Please fix the verification problem. When I log in on my laptop, the phone won't show box to put in the number. Used to work regularly until yesterday. Perhaps it's because I chance my email and it's a bug? QR code log in is fine but I don't like to do it every time I turn on my laptop. Please fix this and I will rate back to 5 stars. Thank you.",
            "The reason why i gv 3 stars,it becoz when we login in other device all chat disappear. Line gv an option to save the chat to google drive,unfortunately every time I try to sv in drive,its not works. Eventhough if it works sv in drive,still faces an isssue which is we cant open it,or its not appear directly like in other apps did. It would be great if Line can make all chat not dissapear,like messenger on FB did,which is the chat appear same like when the last time i see in other device. Thanks!"

We update every week, so keep checking this space for new features and other nifty stuff. <br>  <br>New and Not-so Noticeable:  <br>- Many bug fixes, plus performance and stability improvements. ",
        "comments": [
            "Ever since the update it made it worse. It rings again, that's good. Problem is, people can't hear me but I can hear them. I have to use LINE for the time being until it gets fixed. Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. üëç",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

Daycare 3. Space theme 4. Hospital 5. School i know these already exist but they would be cool to customize. 6. Pets to the customize list 7. Clothes to the customize list. 8. Masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to the list also. I know its a lot and it doesn't effect my game if they don't exist. I love your game! Bye!",
            "This game is amazing I love it so much and it is even better with the free updates , I can not believe they are free! But talking about what is free or not,the game is only starts getting really fun when you make purchases which is not so cool. Over all amazing game it is fun and cool.I love toca boca !!! I hope who ever reads this rewiew has a long awesome life,may you find someone you love and who will cherish you forever . ü§ó",
            "I would have given it five star but u can fix the bug that when we keep things in our house from somewhere else and when we reopen the game it goes back in it's original place and the full version of the game is very costly u can at least give the full game for free only for three days trail so that we can see the other places that how it is like and then buy it. But it's the best game for kids worth game.",
            "I absolutely love this game! However I think there is a bug now that they added the Halloween update. I have seen other reviews that say that the houses are total wrecks. Mine is the same. My houses I decorated have furniture just in a pile, and everything else is just purple. Purple walls, outside on the balcony is purple, the floors are purple, and I cant move anything. Please please fix this bug. I have spent a lot of birthday money on this.",
            "The game is overall good, but before I bought the misty cottage. I had an amazing world and I must have atleast spent 5 hours working on it in total. But as soon as I got the misty cottage, the game started glitching out. Early morning the next day I went on the game and my whole world reset. Now that got me upset. I wish to report this app and I want it to be reported and sorted out immediately. I have everything in the game and its around ¬£70 for it all. Not funny at all. Sort it out please"

        "comments": [
            "The newer versions have a lot of glitches and is extremely slow. For example, sometimes I add items to my cart and then they all disappear. Sometimes the app will suddenly have every item listed as out of stock and you have to restart. When you add items and hit + to increase the number of items it takes forever. Hopefully they fix these issues.",
            "This new update is buggy and I can't check out. It took me an hour to fill my cart due to all the bugs and when I finally clicked check out of course that failed too and I lost the last pick-up slot of the day and have to go grocery shopping in the snow now... I have a Samsung Galaxy. The bugs were: search wouldn't work, browse by category wouldn't work, the app kept crashing and removing most of the items in my cart, and when I clicked check out it said \"failed to fetch payment.\"",
            "This app gets slower everytime I use it. It's more like a glitch generator, and an anger creator. But, compared to going inside of that level of hell, there's really no difference, other than not dealing with the public clowns and Karen's. I continue to use this app though. Am I a glutton for punishment, or a slave of this corporate world that is left no other options?......yes.",
            "This ap is FRUSTRATING and is getting worse! The screen constantly freezes, it won't allow you to side swipe when you are supposed to be able to and right in the middle of looking at something the screen will go blank to \"update\" the page and sometimes it will come back up to the page you were on and sometimes take you all the way to the very beginning of opening the ap. And it's not my internet because it's very reliable and the ap does this no matter what service I'm using.",
            "I thought it was me!! I literally bought a new phone to see if it would fix the issues. When uninstalling and reinstalling the app I just happened to take a look at the reviews, lo and behold every single person in the world has the same problem I do since they combined the websites,hece it completely sucks. I like everyone on here I'm going to have to use a different online shopping app for a different store because this app is useless."

Content material and the language it's like nobody proof reads them anymore. Most common error seen tome over time is that they keep putting the wrong KSRTC image for the Karnataka SRTC content. So many Ads... Way too many. If the intent is to get users to pay for having the ads removed, my friend, that will be a very bad idea. Some of the articles here are vry vry old.",

            "My favorite game, I literally deleted my other games because this is the only one I play now, I love it so much. Everything from how positive it is, to the perfectly fitting audio that plays. I love how simple and easy going this game is and I love how this games helps you succeed. The levels where you can locate items are super fun as well, recommending this game to everyone I know literally!!",
            "Caution. This game is really nicely crafted, very visually rich, and enjoyable to play from levels 1-10. After this, things start to go absolutely mental. There is pop-up after pop-up, harassing you about another new feature. You quickly get to a point where you're bamboozled - everything on the screen is shouting at you. This appears to be by design, hyper confusion and attention hijacking to nurture addiction. This app is nefarious and should be enjoyed only with huge restraint.",
            "Never log into Facebook. It causes you to lose the prizes from any contest you won. I had tons of things coming from a dots race and they vanished the second it connected to Facebook. Also, the game freezes and crashes a lot when watching videos to get a bonus box. You have to be patient when you open the app. It can take over five minutes to come up.",
            "Honestly was obsessed with this game for awhile, but they made a bunch of updates and now every time you view the map about four or five different windows pop up to tell you about the different games. It used to just be the daily bonus. Tired of exiting out of a bunch of stupid notifications just to be able to click on the game I want. They ruined a good thing.",
            "You get to a certain point and you can't win anything without spending money. With prices on everything else in life steadily increasing the last thing I wanna spend money on is a silly phone game. If you could just spend money once or twice, maybe no big deal. But you have to constantly spend money to get perks to help you thru the levels and clearly this is by design. It's a really cool game, and very disappointing to have to delete, but I'm just not up for money hungry games like this."

            "Used to function perfectly but for the last couple months the mobile deposit feature very rarely works. It says that the check amount doesn't match the picture and to try taking the picture again but it never resolves the error. Changing the background, light source, angle, distance and uninstall/reinstall doesn't make a difference. I've wasted so much time on this nonsense.",
            "I've always had a good experience with the app. I appreciate how Wells Fargo keeps me updated on new features, changes and privacy policy updates. I'm also not very tech savvy and the app. is very easy to navigate through and understand. Personally, especially in times like this, I'd rather do my banking from the comfort of my home, car, office instead of standing in line waiting.",
            "Great app. The easiest app I've ever used compared to the one that my credit union uses. Just point and it will do the rest for you. Other app that I've used were not as friendly and hard to take photos that I have to do it a couple of times. This app makes all the adjustments for me.",
            "On its own it's OK. Basic functions are all there but the UI and UX could use a some improvement. When compared to the banking apps of competitors, the design and layout feels a decade behind. Things that take 1 (e.g. swipe left or right) action on competitors apps take 3 on this app (e.g. tap menu, scroll to selection, select action). Not an issue if used infrequently, but the little things could get annoying if Wells Fargo was my main account.",
            "Great app. Makes online banking simple and easy to use. I have all my finances in one easy to use app. My only issue is that when I login sometimes the app doesnt recognize my password. Which is frustrating sometimes. But other than that it's a great app."

            "I like the new layout and look. However, I would give 5 stars if I didn't have to search for what comes through on the alert notifications. Example, \"there's a special loan offer\", where?! I have search for it, when the app should go right to the information that is on alert notification, and not just the home page. Many alerts I just ignore, because I become frustrated trying to find them. Just open directly to them once pressed, otherwise I'm just wasting time seeing the same information.",
            "I really love this app and the website. It's convenient and easy to use. My only complaint right now it that no matter how many times I click on \"Recommendations\" and scroll through it, it ALWAYS says there is 1 waiting. It's been going on for a while and it's on both desktop and mobile, so I know it's not just this latest update to the app. I don't like the advertising of the credit cards all the time but I get it, to keep the app free you need to have ads, no problem. Recommend me stuff all the time, I don't care, just register that I've seen it once I have.",
            "Great app, I mean ausome app, in less than a year, this app has helped me get all three of my credit scores boosted. They were all between 510-530 and now, only a year later all three range from 622-643. So this app has done wonders. After a year of doing what the app said I went from having no credit to having 3 credit cards and owning a house. SO CREDIT KARMA GETS A 10 STAR RATING FROM ME. I USED TO SPEND MONEY AS FAST AS IT HIT MY POCKET NOW I HAVE OVER 10,000 IN SAVINGS AND I'M A PACK RAT.",
            "Good app, but this latest update sucks. I don't like the new UI, and it feels slower now. And one thing that's been bugging me forever, when you open the app and it displays where you enter your pin, raise all the numbers up. It's way too low. But the in app UI sucks now. Change it back please. It was easier on the eyes before and easier to read",
            "I've been monitoring my credit for a couple years now with Credit Karma, but this is thee worst update they've done! Not to mention, your score in the app will never be what a lender pulls. So I just use it to monitor credit card usage and any collections. Other than that, the app is garbage. Edit to include CK's response: I already know that. I am informing others, because clearly your formula isn't accurate. And if it's not accurate... it's not useful."

I am unable to receive payments, send payments, add money or cash out money that's in my cash app account. I've reached out to support numerous times with no response. I love there convenience of the app and the boosts I was getting but not anymore.",
            "I hate this app! It's useless. Can't do anything like you're suppose to be able to. Linking cards and accounts never works like it should or even like it did one time before. I had to replace my card, same card and company just a new numbers but it won't link the new information?! The card is allowed and supported but now I can't load money. Hate using this app unless it's completely my last resort!",
            "This app is a scam to me now unlike before that it's working well. When you download it it will be asking for your SSN. Its really frustrating. Some guys are patronizing themselves as customer care representatives all they do is hack your bank accounts and all your hard earned money is gone. The money sent to me can't be accessed too for the past 2 weeks. I don't encourage anyone to download this app",
            "Cashapp is GREAT! That is, until you have ANY problem with your account! Support is useless! I've sent FIFTEEN (15) emails in the last 2 days because I had to order a new card and I've been sent TWO (2) that don't match the new card info on my account, with only 2 responses, neither of which got the problem fixed, and nothing further from them. CASHAPP DOES NOT HAVE RELIABLE SUPPORT. IF YOU NEED TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE, I WILL APPLY FOR THE JOB AND SHOW YOU HOW TO MANAGE A BUSINESS AND KEEP FANS!",
            "This app is horrible in scanning id. There is no button to use when taking a picture of front and back of id. The front i had to click on flash sign, the back side i had to close app and reopen to even see a flash sign and then when i clicked for back side, the functions changed ot just lit up id. The app took a picture on its own of back side as i was moving my id arpund for 30 min annoyed. And then it only took when i put super close, taking only an 8th of whole back side, twice!"

            "The app was great. However, the new update (oct. 30th) has been frustrating and its hard to navigate. You cannot reach the catagory of years for videos anymore. It's a lot less organized on the idols pages, it was much easier with it's past organization. So in general, it's just more of a downgrade and it is just harder to find videos or certain things you are looking for.",
            "Bugs over bugs. Artists happen to suddenly not be able to read comments during a live, I cannot watch any replays anymore because the app just keeps crashing every single time?? I like the new design but it's unacceptable to release a version of an app that isn't even working properly. Right now, this is just taking up my storage space, nothing more.",
            "The new update is horrible. It won't let me watch any videos, it just lags and then the app closes. You also have to pay now to comment on lives, which you previously didn't have to do, don't they already have enough money? Not to mention the new confusing layout, which they clearly just copied from weverse (their biggest competitor right now). I'm honestly thinking of uninstalling.",
            "my experience with vlive is normally great but just today, after the unexpected update something was wrong. first, the pause/play button disappears from time to time while watching so i have to exit full screen to be able to pause/play; second, i missed a live today. i didn't get any notifs about it and i can't find it anywhere even though the live is being tweeted about and has been seen by many of my peers. please fix it üò≠üò≠. i want to at least be able to watch the video even if not live.",
            "There's a bug, everytime I play a video the app crashes! I tried to reinstall it but it keeps happening. Please do something with it. Plus the new layout doesn't allow us to browse through videos of channels and you made the following and unfollowing of channels so much more complicated. All those features of creating a profile for each channel are so unnecessary. It was better the way it was."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to üëç. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 üåü is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "App worked great for the first couple of months. Now it won't track my steps. And if it does, it says that NONE of them are convertible. I've also had a lot of issues with steps being converted to sweat coins (it will track that I've walked 12,000 steps but only convert 100). I sent a request for help and never got a reply. Read one of the responses to a review and you guys tell people to submit tickets but you have an automated message respond saying that they pretty much never check it. Wth.",
            "Love this app, its not easy to build sweatcoins but if you save them you can earn some pretty cool stuff. I walk a ton for work so its generally easy to accumulate them. The offers update every few days so it always feels fresh. They also have awesome humanitarian causes you can donate your coins to. I would rate this app 10/5 if I could. Its engaging yet not overwhelming, one of my favorites i constantly recommend the app to my friends and coworkers",
            "Please fix my account. I have exactly 938,814 steps that keep adding up and wont caluculate to the sweatcoins. I have the right setting and everthing and no battery saver or anything. Im not sure if there is a problem with the app or if they are just scamming me when my coins actuly start to add up after 2 years.(update) i uninstalled and reinstalled and its counting again but i lost the 938,814 steps that never got calculated. Is there a way you could put these back onto my account.",
            "Whenever I use this app or hit 2√ó boost it starts counting steps then it will stop like every 10 to 15 sec for at least 20 sec at a time , the timer is stil going but not counting the steps . I am 67 yrs old and was so excited about this app . Some days its so hard to get started excercising but I make myself so I can stay fit. Please fix this !!!",
            "I've been a loyal sweatcoin user for over 2 years with no issues until recently. The app will continuously stop tracking my steps for no reason. I've re-installed multiple times and it never seems to work. Some days it decides to track my steps though. It's inconsistent, I already contacted support through the app and they didn't do anything to help or seem to care. I do over 15,000 steps per day and I've been subscribing to their 30 coin/month and it's basically been a complete waste."

            "It's a great and helpful app. I only have two complaints: 1. It should be easier to organise your list. I want to put the titles in a custom order, because sorting by rating puts them in wrong order due to multiple titles having the same rating. I also think the lists should instantly update when you give a new rating, now I have to wait a while before my list gets updated",
            "I have never had such a great, useful, dependable, easy to use, informative, and valuable app. Valuable I have won a few bucks having IDBM as my personal bet settler. You should try it, you won't regret it. I continue to explore this app and find more things I can do with it. I really can't say enough about my IMBD app",
            "Best app ever for film or TV lovers. Truthfully use this app multiple times a day, loads over an average week. Amazing for those \"what have I seen him/her in before\" moments; also those \"who the hell dat\" moments. Also settles many marital disputes for couples that watch a lot together. Great for watching suggestions and I especially like the Prime recommendations as a Prime user. Trailers are also useful. Goofs are funny to watch out for, location & OST details Great too. Love it - thank you.",
            "I really like this app. I can watch tv shows and movies for free. I have read several reviews about problems playing trailers or anything. I have not experienced any of these issues. Everything has played perfectly. I have only been using this app for a little while but its worth having.",
            "Could be a little less glitchy and more user friendly but overall great app. IMDb is the best! Better than Rotten Tomatoes by a mile for sure. I have been using IMDb for twenty years now and they've always proven to be the best in collective information about a movie, celebrity, tv show, etc."

Normal fixes (clear cache, reinstall, etc) do not work. Worked fine until just recently. All other apps on the tablet function, as intended. Only one does not, Verizon.",
            "While the app itself can be useful, please don't allow yourself to fall for the Verizon Up reward program that the app will nag you about incessantly. You essentially agree to allow them to spy on everything you do with your phone, and harvest all kinds of your personal data in the process, by signing up for it. They aren't trying to be your pal, they just want your consent to profit even more off of your account.",
            "It does not save my login credentials - I have to re-log in every time I open it, even when I have \"Remember Me\" selected & permissions on. Logging in is a two-step process so this wastes time. This is the connection my computer uses (a jetpack) & it has a data limit so I need to track it, which means I have to put up with this every day (I haven't found the same information on the website). I didn't have this problem with the old phone, which may have had an older version of the app. Annoying.",
            "The app keeps me up to date with my data limit, I can pay my bill, look at my bill, and get my $3.00 Amazon gift card every month with the app. Make sure you take advantage of receiving and using your $3.00 gift card every month to offset your bill. It's a nice litte bonus at the end of the month that actually helps.",
            "Very buggy along with their website. I been trying to fix my billings, plans, add-ons for the longest time and still seem to be getting the run around. App is worthless and keeps logging me off. Broken links or none what so ever. Now I am wondering if I made the right choice. When downgrading plans, make sure to un enroll in any add-on or you won't be able to un enroll afterwards and be charge each month. Check when changing plans that you don't get hidden or added fees."

Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",

Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update.

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user ü•≤",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

Em cada guia o autor, data, finalidade da escrita, versos-chave, pren√∫ncios e escreveu um breve resumo ser√° inclu√≠do.

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "Did not bother using it, once I saw the selection. Not even close to texture selection, they do not even have half of the Canadian magazines. Such as Ricardo, cottage life, and many other french ones. Plus the subscription price is overpriced. I am simply trying to find something close to what texture app use to be. 14.99 for reg subscription and premium was 19.99. this was a great app pluses u could share it on 5 devices.. this is totally over priced.",
            "Thanks for responding to my problem. Now I can read from the app. But their is one more thing which is bothering me, why I can't read curtain magazines like TIME or Wired. Whenever I open it, it says this magazine is blocked in your region. I tried changing the country in the settings but still no use. If paying and can't read the stuff I am interested in what's the use of this app anyway. Looking for a quick response.",
            "More magazines must have easy read option. Otherwise it becomes difficult to read the magazines on the go. Secondly the app needs to have an inbuilt dictionary. If these two changes are incorporated, me being a gold member would like to say that the app is perfect...",
            "It is easy to read what interests readers and skipping other items. Comfortable access to headlines though access to detailed articles are confined to subscribers. By grading contents, more cheaper access can be given to students and teachers who have low affordability. Special concessions can be considered for home makers - for the yeoman service they do.",
            "Very useful app, covering wide range of magazines from diverse field at nominal pricing. One can quench their thirst of reading magazines of their interest. Useful for all age groups. Digital versions are convenient to read anytime, anywhere. It is user friendly and simple to use."

            "This app is a poorly engineered solution to a fake problem. Android comes with an excellent visual voicemail system, and it worked great for years, right up until T-Mobile shut down their support for it and made me install this piece of s--t. Update Oct 2020: It's now even worse. Every time I start it, it tells me it has to delete all my voicemails because it's \"associated to a different account.\" It then tries to sell me \"text to speech.\" At least now I know why it exists. It's a money grab.",
            "Breaking third party integration so they can charge $4 a month is about as \"carrier\" a move as you could make. Voice to text isn't worth $4/mo, but it angers me that the so called uncarrier is ruining the capability for customers using third party apps. To top it off, this app they try to force on you is buggy. Late messages, annoying and pointless notifications, trying to trick you into extra fees. Too bad we don't have an FCC willing to protect consumers from scummy companies like TMobile.",

Still, in one way sad that my expectations were so low that now that I can receive a voicemail ( something that should be so simple) I'm excited about it.",
            "Worse voicemail set up I have ever used!! It just flat CANNOT be depended on. Shame on t-mobile for not paying attention to consumers and not doing something about this! Just read the reviews! The factory voicemail set-ups that come with phones (samsung, ect ect) work perfectly fine. This stupid app is a joke. Come on t-mobile....figure it out!!",
            "Terrible performing app. Never get new voicemail notifications/sync on time. I always have to go into the app and manually refresh it to watch the loading wheel turn and turn until finally the voicemail appears. Often buggy and doesn't always find the voicemail when refreshing it. Very frustrating after previously having an iPhone with wonderful visual voicemail built in."

I don't care for the redesign, but it's not as much of an issue.",

It's a overall a great app otherwise I wouldn't pay for all the bells and whistles, however its missing a dark/black theme, if it had that it would be the perfect dictionary app üëåüòé.

Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal.

Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. üôÑ",

Otherwise a normal person will not buy from your app bcoz its wasting of money on buying suxh expensive cloths.. And even in todays fashionable time no one is gone repeat the same thing in the party n all. So totally not gonna buy expensive clothes",

Even though i typed it in for my debit card. 2 time it has also been over 2 months and now again they can't find my address but yet never reach out I write them all the time. Worst company ever. Shien is waaaaaay better and deliver in 2 weeks. Ver poor customer service"

            "Wow! I am so impressed with this App! It's very easy to use. It shows you how to do the exercises and it even counts the seconds for you!!! It's definitely motivating! Thank you for such a great app!!! The only thing I can't work out is how to use it on my IPad or laptop. It connects with my google account and phone thats it..... Be great if someone could help me get it on one of those devices please! üôÇ",
            "I LOVE this app. It's AMAZING! There are exervcises for every training. You can even do exercises in your bed and office. This is so convenient and it also tracks your exercise and reminds you to drink water. I absolutely reccomend this app. It also helps you loose weight and keep you fit. Definitely recommend downloading this! Keep up the great work! üëç",
            "Fantastic app with great fitness features! Way better than an app I paid 20$ for 3 months for. Ladies, give this a try. I'm finding myself doing a bit more and more each day. It's fun, easy, and comprehensive, yet challenging when you're comfortable taking that next step and increasing your duration and intensity. Very user friendly: great pause/stop functions and additional direction when you need a move or pose explained in greater detail. I should of just went with this!",
            "Best of all. I have came across several apps to give me a proper plan to stick on. Out of all this is the best. Honest opinion. I wondered how it got high ratings and I downloaded. Ended up giving high ratingüòÇ Pretty sure you will fall in love with this app. Ads aren't that disturbing and the UI is pretty descent. Be honest with the app and it will give u a very good result. Go on with it.",
            "I thoroughly like this app, I do have one issue but it isnt enough to drop a star in my rating. I would like the option to enter in workouts I have done not on the app. I do 20 minutes of cardio every morning and would like to track that with the rest of my things on the app. I will add the water reminder is incredible to have. I hate water and will go days without 1 sip other than to brush teeth so this is a huge help. Over all I enjoy using the app."

            "I loved this app before the recent update!!! Before you could practice for hours and actually get somewhere with your learning. You could make mistakes and it would push you to get it right and that was so encouraging and rewarding and you felt like you were getting somewhere. Now with the hearts, as soon as you make 5 mistakes, thats it, end of session. Awful and very deflating. Yes I could pay to upgrade, but thats ¬£7 a month, over ¬£80 for a year!!!! Very very disappointed.",
            "Fix the problem when we change email, the app keeps remembering the previous email. Create the option to delete courses or organize them by preference. The heart system is terrible, remove it. The application has too many bugs for silly things, it does not load the option to follow, sometimes the audio doesn't work. I don't uninstall it because they asked me to use it at school, but this app is terrible.",
            "I can only recommend the Desk Top version of Duolingo, and even that is marginal. The mobile app is cumbersome and frustrating with having to earn and buy errors, unless you spring for the Pay version. Their slogan used to be \"Make learning fun and free.\" Wll, let me tell you, the new Hearts system is not fun. And, I think their new update is solely intended to make people buy the Plus version. Also, both versions have some of the silliest sentences to translate. Why learn them if they have no purpose? I think there are better, more efficient ways to learn a new language.",
            "The recent update to this app has made things unacceptable. The introduction of a 'hearts' system (when you get 5 things wrong in a row, you can't progress for the rest of the day) is anathema to the process of learning. What's more, I'm relatively sure the developers changed the accepted fields of words for answers smaller (phone is no longer an alternative to 'cell phone', an Americanism used nowhere outside of the United States). This is to push users into buying a subscription. Awful.",
            "Very disappointed with the update to the heart system. It's to slow people down? Then just limit the number of lessons per day instead of hearts, but allow unlimited practice sessions. I'm learning nothing now because it feels like a test and I get too much anxiety with those. Mistakes are NORMAL when learning a new language! Even those who speak a second language for many years still make mistakes. Who cares if people go too fast? Worry about those who don't and use the app appropriately]!]"

Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",

There is no way of knowing how much is synced and how much is not. 3. Syncing takes a lot of time too. 4. They have given a provision of deleting a notebook from OneDrive, but it doesn't really go away from OneNote after deleting. 5. It doesn't work when the device is connected to Internet. It keeps lagging and sometimes even crashes.",
            "Best Note App Ever. It sync to most of my devices. So I do not need my specific device to retrieve all my notes. It works even better with paste it notes. So handy for short reminder. I do online recording video and OneNote sync well with my phone and desktop. So I don't even need to buy additional USB writing pad. My Note8 and now Note10 will do the trick! Highly recommended for those taking a lot of notes and also using Windows to sync 'among' devices. My phone, laptop and desktop!"

            "I LOVE THIS APP. I've had it for about 2 years now and it works perfectly. The updates are working and I don't experience any glitches and problems. All my favourite books are written on the app and getting to know the writers and the rest of the Wattpaders is really awesome and fun. I can write my chapters properly, only problem is, I'm worried it does not save or publish properly as it gives me false information and can be confusing. But nonetheless, great reading app!! Highly recommended.",
            "Helloooo. I'm writing this to say that I like the previous version of wattpad. When I open the app, it doesn't take long for the stories to appear. Now, I still need to open the internet to see my library which is a bit of a hassle. If I may recommend, please return the previous versions. The one without the need to download offline stories, because seriously, I don't like the update. I've been on wattpad since 2011 and so far, this is the worse update for me.",
            "The app itself is good but lately, i have been experiencing a lot of events such as one time I was writing a story that was worth about 600+ words but then a warning popped up saying \"wattpad has suddenly stopped\" which as you may know, all of the things i written wasn't saved. It broke my heart because I've been wanting to finish i but I have to restart and write it again. I hope that you can fix this. If so maybe the problem is my device.",
            "I'm using wattpad since 2014. Every year I saw how it changed. I'm missing the old wattpad when there is no Ads (every chapter), you can read different stories without paying for it, and you can add many stories in your library. Idk, what are the creators are thinking, lol. I just hope that the next update will get more better (lessen the ads and remove the limit of stories you can add in your library for offline reading)",
            "I totally want the Old Wattpad back. Everything is far different of what I used to love about this app. I've been using this app for almost 10 years and I know that the creator wants to improve it and earned money from it but this is too much. I have been experiencing some moments when I can't read because I need to connect to Internet but I'm already connected and that confuse me..."

            "Too many ads now popping up, and annoying volume boost when entering room.",
            "Don't touch camfrog cloud rooms. It asks you to verify details including bank account. If you do not verify, account gets banned until you do. Your backed into a corner.....stay away from it ! If your card is declined by their system your screwed unless you have another card There is no option to back out. Just use the normal app or website. This isn't phising...my account is banned cos my credit card isn't apparently supported by yourselves.!",
            "Coming from an old user. After your latest update all bugs have emerged. 1st of all im using your mobile app, everytime i enter a chat room and pick up a user to view, i have to always reload their cam and its inconvenient and very annoying. 2nd, the mic. I cant seem to mute it permanently if i want to, and the name of the dj (whoever they are) are reflected on the bottom screen of the app. That was very unpleasant to see and always annoying. Please fix the app asap i like using it. Thanks",
            "I've been using this site for a few years and Camfrog doesn't care about keeping the female safe there is some males on there taking screenshots and recording and I have messaged Camfrog about it many times but they have yet to do anything! It's a very addicting site but yet they don't care about keeping their female safe!"

            "Constant download errors until update fixed the problem. Works as advertised now! Thanks for fixing.",
            "Almost unusable. My subscriptions expired, but I never received an email informing me about that. When I ran the app it never notified me about expired subscriptions. When I tried to open a magazine, it simply wouldn't open - no error message, just eternal spinning waiting icons. I only realized what the problem was when I was able to open older issues but not newer ones. I tried to purchase a new subscription, but wasn't able to find any way to accomplish the task - I could only find an option to buy an individual issue, which was NOT what I wanted. I've had it with this really crappy app. I'm switching to Readly.",
            "I have been using Zinio for quite awhile now. Magazines downloads are high quality. No problem there. The reason I am leaving Zinio is the constant barrage of offers and sales notifications. If you want to be notified when a magazine is ready for download you also get their marketing notifications. It's constant and there is no way to opt out from them.",
            "Just like everyone else, cannot log in after a factory reset, says a unexpected error has occured and check conection when conection is 100% ok. Also need the ability to store magazines on sd card as this app eventually will fill internal memory so you have to ditch previous magazines that you have paid for to read new editions. Just not good enough. The app also says that if i log out all previous magazines will be lost, WHY? We need to have the choice to SAVE with the option to save as a pdf",
            "I can redo the review as Zinio did sort out a problem that meant I could not get recent editions like several other reviewers. Unexpected error try again, network. All reviewers got the same cut & paste answer After uninstalling and re- installing 3 times over several days it finally worked again. Seeing the app version numbers my suspicion is a faulty update caused the problems. The last re install had a different app revision. Zinio could have been more upfront if this was the problem."

            "Worst texting app for many reasons, first of all I earn credits but it uses them if I receive messages, but worst of all it makes bots to text you to use up all your credits, I've had over 60 credits and now all gone because they put bots to take your credits for receiving messages. You sometimes dont even get your messages on time at all. The offers never work. Worst texting app and if you wanted to text or call you might as well pay for a carrier service. Dont install or waste your time....",
            "This app is really great if you know your email password. But, I finally found mine, and used it, and this app is great! You can call and text. obviously. But you just watch videos to get credits, and watchibg videos to talk to people isn't bad compared to paying each month. This app os great. LOVE IT!!!!",
            "Typical Wifi texting App, filled with Ads nonstop and left to right. I forgot when I re-downloaded this you have to have \"credits\" that expire every 48 hours to text anything or call anyone which is so stupid. To get more credits you have to, you guessed it sit through 15 second to 1 minute adds for half a credit to 1 full credit each.

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

            "Great game, its a good way to pass the time. Bit difficult to grasp what to do in the beginning but once you get the hang of it then its great fun. 30/10/2020 Um.... what happened guys? This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ‚ù§ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",
            "Game is great.. expensive if you want to keep up...but it never ever connects for me the 1st time . and it's not my interent it's your server...One time I have to use my interent then I have to use my data..and most times I have to go back and forth 3 or 4 times to see which it will take...and this is every single day a few times a day .it never is the same and takes forever to load when it finally gets working.. but I do love the game! I am addicted just wish you would fix those 2 things..."

            "Been playing for awhile and got enough coins to cash out for a voucher, however everything is showing as sold out. I'm using the UK version so maybe people will have a better experience in other countries. Update I have logged in several times through the day and all show as sold out. I also do not understand the new piggy bank, how do you collect nuts and bolts?, how do you heist from other players?",
            "It was good. Then it was not so good, introduced piggy bank... A way to spend tokens in hopes of winning more. Prize was tokens and blackjack hands. New piggy is worse.. I don't even get tokens, just get jerked around by the piggy. I know I will never get the last nickel to cash out at$10, doesn't bother me, liked the gift cards. I know I will never get anything from the piggy. I just keep coming back hoping I will get one last gift card. And I cannot find your help center.",
            "Worst app ever!!!. Once you are approaching the minimum withdrawal then they won't give you any cash anymore and, I am just 0.15 away.They just let you watch a lot of advertisements over and over again. I won't recommend this app. Now they have an update to heist from some other players too. Nah it just goes on in circles over and over again.No withdrawal has been made.I have been playing it for a while. Highly won't recommend this app.",
            "Waste of time. Period. Deleting now with no regrets despite being $0.25 away from cashing out (For 1-2weeks of multi-daily check-ins to the app). My gut says I'll never see a dime and my time is better spent elsewhere on games and activities I actually enjoy. Download at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you! Edit: After that response, I'm confident that I'm right. They make vague and empty promises so they can make more money through their scam.",
            "Has been slow for cash payouts but I have gotten a few gift cards.. Now this app sucks. Doesn't pay out. You get enough tokens and all of a sudden its sold out... used to be legit. Beats paying for scratchers but man change the payout system back to what it was a year ago and I will change my rating back to 5 stars. Took a legit app and made it a SCAM or just near damn impossible to get any gift cards. Fun to pass the time but doesn't pay out anymore üôÉ"

            "This was my go-to app until about a month ago. I have to go out and then reload it frequently to get the current info. It often gets stuck at a time hours earlier. It's raining and it does not note that. Another app has 37% chance of rain in my current location (which is about right), and this app says 6% while it rains. I'm uninstalling it in favor if a better, more accurate app. I rely on relative accuracy with updates because I plan outdoor activities.",
            "The widget has started routinely saying \"weather data not available\". When it does actually show the weather, it is usually not current, actually showing the weather from hours & hours ago. Also, it takes a really long time to start up, which it didn't used to do. Whatever \"improvements\" have been made to this app have been horrible, & have made it much slower & much worse than it used to be. I'm looking around for other options, so I can unload what has unfortunately become a major turkey.",
            "I had this app for years and it began to have really low speed opening up. I uninstalled it and went with another app. The speed on it was fine, just had a lot of ads. I went back to The Weather Channel app hoping it had improved. IT HAS NOT!!! It just keeps spinning and draining my battery. It's been 15 minutes and still spinning. Poor, poor performance. Not pleased with this at all.",
            "TOO MANY ADS!! There is a ad that you are forced to watch after every video!! Also the sound quality is VERY POOR on almost every video, then the ad comes on and is extremely loud. It's annoying to have to constantly adjust the volume level for every video and ad! This app has been getting worse with every update!! The other weather apps are much better and more detailed. Sorry Weather Channel but I think I will be uninstalling your app now and I don't recommend it to anyone.",
            "Wish I had never updated this app. My old weather channel app was so much better. Every time I try to shrink the map, there's very little to no response. I have to tap the screen and then try to shrink the map so I can see a broader View, but almost every time I do that, the app has to restart. The old map showing national weather would respond very well to the touch of my fingers. Not so anymore."

Until , I let it go first and it took 24hours like that , so I though I would log out first but it was even harder for me because I could not open my account , it always turned out that my email add was blocked and I did not commit any violation . I'm so disappointed to install this apps üòí",
            "Every 24 hours, the app blocks my account. I have not broken any terms and conditions but still I get blocked out of my own account. Very frustrating as they don't even give you a warning. I hot blocked in the middle of conversations and didn't even get a chance to exchange information with the people I liked. All day I'm bombarded by disgusting messages from men but they don't get blocked. When I signed in using a different email, the same men found me again and messaged me.",
            "Every since the first time I used this app it was pretty chill and fun too. But then after the first time I went live the app has been crashing since yesterday. I go on the app for 3 seconds and the app crashes. It took me almost 30 minutes just to get the app to stop crashing so much this morning to finally get my live stream to work. But now I can even go on the app to the setting or nothing bc the app crashes in 3 seconds or less everytime I try to use the app.",
            "It's a very awsome app, giving the user the ability to meet alot of new and exciting people. The only problem that I have discovered so far is often the app refuses to allow the connection between myself and another party hopefully this error corrects itself when or if I switch to a better service provider, other than that it's awesome. Good job team SKOUT keep up the good work. We love you",
            "V 6.28.0 is broken on my note 20 ultra 5g. Once it goes through the \"pledge\" things everything breaks. The screen frequently refreshes and forces to the meet tab and crashes when navigating the chat messages. I installed a 6.26.0 apk and it was OK until it auto updated and broke again. I've now disabled auto updates and reverted back again to 6.26.0. I've sent a crash report, fix it!"

            "It's great, the exercises are good and the customisation allows you to adjust it to your level and capabilities, although the ads might be quite annoying that's a good way to keep this as a free to use app. Also the water tracking is great, I always forget to drink water either bc I'm busy or I don't pay attention to it, this is quite helpful.",
            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard üí™.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

Now you can track your naps along with your nightly sleep data; set goals for your nap frequency and duration; and see what effect any naps you might take during the day may have on the duration and quality of your sleep at night.",
        "comments": [
            "I love the app and use it every day. The only problem I have is that when you enter when you went to bed the latest it will allow you to enter is 11:45pm. Last night I went to bed at 12:15am. Unfortunately I cant reflect that now becUze it wont let me roll over the day.",
            "The sliders you use to log sleep, awake, and habits times are hard to use. They can slide to values other than the ones you're recording by accidentally touching them as you're navigating around the screen. I don't care for the interface much. Discontinuing. Wish I could get my money back.",
            "(email feedback didn't get through) The main issue that needs fixing is scrolling through the sleep log where you enter data. You have to be very careful where you put your finger as any touch and swipe up/down will change the sliders of options you've already selected. That's not normal android app behavior. The UI needs some work. Edit: Developer replied. Updated rating and will rate higher following next update.",
            "**EDIT: Since my review, the developers started working on a nap feature. I am really excited to use it, and its so nice that the developers are responsive and care. Thank you!! It's a really nice app-- but I can't add daytime naps? I may have narcolepsy and was hoping I could log all of my hours slept per day into the app- but it only accounts for overnight sleep, when a majority of my sleep happens in naps throughout the day.",
            "The interface might be slightly confusing at times, but overall, it's a very useful app. One thing that I feel is missing is the option of choosing the way I finally woke up, i.e. naturally or because the alarm clock went off. That's a very significant factor in my case and it would be good to include it in the analysis."

            "Updated 10/31/20: The app is totally unusable. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, but I can't hit a single button on it. Completely useless. Original Review: Used to work great, but lately it has all kinds of bugs whether it suddenly decides it won't accept my payment method anymore or errors out when I try to place an order. It freezes and often forgets to clear my order bag after I've successfully picked up an order. So many headaches lately, I don't know what went wrong. Ued to love this app.",
            "Constantly buggy and glitches. I've used it successfully but it typically requires constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the app or religiously clearing your cache. The deals screen often says you've already used a deal and have to wait an hour even when you haven't ordered in weeks. Overall, a frustrating experience for something that should be a convenience.",
            "Updated 10/2020: I've done everything including uninstalling and re installing. The app doesn't work at all. love this app when it actually works. More than half of the time, I can't pull anything up on it, or it is frozen and nothing on it will work. \"Connectivity issues\" is what it stated. Those issues are not with my phone, because i have service and wifi. Please fix!!!! It's pretty hard to use the app while there when I can't even get in to it.",
            "Fantastic app, works every time. Orders being automatically submitted and requiring \"reopening\" every time I switch apps is annoying but no big deal. One of the best developed fast food pre-order apps. The restaurants, maybe 1.5 star. They must be hiring illiterates, or they glance at the screen and throw in guesses for anything forgotten. The \"hot&spicy\" chicken patty isn't very spicy going down but DON'T LET IT BACK UP. Seems it turns into the fire of hades in your guts. Omg I cried, no joke.",
            "Well, a couple years later, new phone, different Android version, still freezing on the opening screen. so unreliable (CLEARING CACHE DOES NOTHING!) - your food isn't that great that your app should be so problematic. Business 101 - don't make it difficult for people to do business with you. BK works great EVERY time - BYE!"

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 secondsü•∂üò¨üò¨ Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

Also, this game spams lots of ads, and the ones for itself is just total rubbish, doing the I'm a GODDAMN FREAKING NOOB kinda things and accidental touches automatically triggers the link to the install window.

I am having the same problems as everyone else: The app notifies you of the message but upon clicking on it, the message time says 0:00/ out of nothing and does not play and is not transcribed. I keep force stopping and deleting the cache but these messages don't load for hours. I don't use the standard call-in voicemail and haven't had a password set up for years. Really frustrating because obviously voicemails tend to be time-sensitive.",

            "Flaky is the best way to describe it. Sometimes a VM will show up in the app within a minute of a message left. Sometimes hours later, like 6-12 hours later. Sometimes not at all. I cannot figure out when it'll flake out. And now you jerks PUT ADS in there too? Time to dump you turds.",

            "This app used to work great... but since the update I can't get ANY of my messages to play and it takes 20 minutes for the messages to even transcribe. I mean... what happened. If I have to use the vm that came with this phone then I might as well delete this app."

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

            "I love this game, it is a good one, but lately I have found a lot of server connection errors specially in this last update so try to fix this problem as soon as you can. I also have a suggestion for a multiplayer game in the original base same like the crater in the next season it would be wonderful to share tasks with friends, also please try to make more free rewards than paid ones to be suitable for young players and unemployed people, thanks.",
            "I normally would give this 5 stars, but there are loading problems for me in this game. I'm afraid I'll lose all my progress and $$ that I've spent. Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",
            "This games was alot of fun until I found out that all it takes is one glitch to cause you to lose everything. I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",
            "5 star for THE BEST ONLINE ZOMBIE GAME I ever played! But if you are a newbie, there are things need to consider. > The intro loading is a bit longer than usual game. > The game mechanics is based in real life situation so it is a bit hard. (Not all) > Don't forget to enjoy!!! #ComeToOurClanWeDoHelpEachOther. III % (Clan Name)"

Either don't do the push notifications like that until they've been there a little, or if it's bugging, fix it; I don't mind if someone unmatches but I'd rather know that's why they're not showing up so I'm not left thinking the app is sabotaging it? Definitely wouldn't spend money on it like that.",
            "Totally miserable experience. Repetitive match suggestions, they keep appearing even after I reject them. Overpriced super expensive extras. All my matches, conversations, media and settings were lost after a website update - I was unable to continue with my connections - no reaction from support. And that was a paid \"gold\" account! Complete waste of money, time and energy.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Dudes swipe right, in order to match but don't talk. It makes no sense. If you're interested in someone and match them, why be unresponsive? It is very immature and wastes everyone's time. Therefore I am giving a low rating. There's great potential, but people need to stop being immature and actually talk to their matches.",
            "Installed the app and cannot log on either with Facebook, phone or email. Constant errors keep popping up when trying to log into an existing account. Edit October 2020. Since found out I have been banned from Tinder. When I spoke to them, they will not tell me why I have been banned and they didn't do appeals. How can you ban someone and not tell them why or to even get their side of the story!!!",
            "Ive been on tinder acouple of times in the past and it was easy without and real problem or bug. I downloaded it again last night and it won't open and keeps saying \"we're experiencing some issues\". Who's messed around with it? I mean there's no actual chance of meeting anyone on there, but it was perfectly fine and straightforward before."

Also the note delivered was hand written, it should be in printed form and even I select the option to not show my name, still they wrote my name. Its been more than 7 days when I raised complaint and still they haven't done anything. I will never order from FNP again.",
            "Till now its best .... Thankyou so much for reaching us to the best !!! Just there is a problem while making a payment!! Please look at the payment process it does get completed on the spot instead of fetching any link in mesaages or emails, or it just works like that !! Thankyou üòä Hello there, Its an humble request can you please open one of your frenchiese here in dhule maharashtra, i hope you'll consider my opinion ‚ù§",
            "This is an excellent app to deliver gift items to any place at any item. But I dont like the way tickets are addressed. Generally you should close a ticket when the whole issue is addressed. I just see someone just replying to it and it is closed automatically. And there are no app notifications to let us know there has been a reply in the ticket we raised nor for its closure. Though the motive is to provide a better service, this is irritating.",
            "This is one of the best app ever if want to surprise your near and dear one..I was out of town and wanted to make my husband's birthday very special, but i thought without me how it would be possible, but fnp made it memorable. They gave the Beautiful and tasty cake. It was awesome, my husband was very happy i recommend to go for fnp everytime. I missed to add they delivered it before time. Thank u fnp..keep growing üëç",
            "Pathetic app and service. Usually product cost is high and we understand it is for service. But the service is really very very very bad no use of paying high price then usual. FnP has spoiled my special day by informing that service can't be provided before 2 hrs of that occasion whereas I did a advance booking almost 4 to 5 days before. Not gonna recommend this app for its services neither I'll be using it anymore."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

(Caucasian) Mental illness is something that is prevalent to all races, however it would be nice to see that the brown community is being included.

            "The app keeps crashing. It closes suddenly. I thought it was because of my buggy old phone, but now I'm using another phone model and it works well but the app keeps closing. I asked my friends and they told me it also occurs with them. I can't even order. Plus the attendance is the worse. I lost one account because I lost my old phone and the number was gone as well, then I couldn't recover it, I asked for help and the support never came. iFood never did that to me.",
            "I pay for the monthly pass... And I am pissed off because it won't connect. And yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've turned my phone one and off.... I needed up using Doordash with no problems only it cost me more money because I don't have a pass there. I'd like my 10 bucks back at this point. Uber needs help and no matter who I email I never hear anything back.",
            "After half a year, the app didn't improve. Application is full of bugs. Even cannot register in the system. A Year ago it didn't accept my email address, half a year ago it did, but didn't show the keyboard for the first name/last name fields. Half a year later (oct 2020) still the same issue. Guys, how is it possible to create such a bad app? Shame",
            "Worst app. Doesn't even run properly. App tries to connect to server but can't. After half an hour finally connects and asks for address and looks for food and bang no response. Just the same screen with address option. Looks like it is searching for food in Mars that's why there is no food around me. And the same process repeat again and again.",
            "I can't get the app to open when on wifi. I have to take it off wifi on my android in order for it to work. Otherwise I get the same message \"try again\" and no matter how many times you click it , it won't open the app. I have a brand new S20 Ultra and it hasn't worked on my previous android wither."

            "From what I can see this map is just ok. I'd like to find one satellite map, just one out there that could show me where I live in actual true Time, picture in focus, up close in focus! Not a big blur of I don't know what? The area where I live from a satellite view in Focus. I want to see the eight acres in my backyard in focus. I'd like to see my car in front of my home. Not cars that used to live here years ago. I've been here eighteen years and haven't seen one map with a picture of one of my cars in my driveway. Anybody got any good ideas for a good focused View. True time?",
            "Was ok this morning, but it chipped out and I deleted it, now I can't get it to download, my signal is weak here though, I'll try again tomorrow, if it's still not working I'll have to call Verizon and see what's wrong, morning after STILL having trouble installing this app., I'll keep checking,still won't install at noon, will check again later,getting less stars, used to like this app, finally after 3 days lets me install it, hopefully it's updated and better",
            "The app beeps every so often to let you know you're over the speed limit, which is annoying. It should let you set a limit over the posted speed in order to not get a ticket.",

        "comments": [
            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great ‚Äî the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash ‚Äî even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "I enjoy this game, very addictive!Recommend it to everyone wanting to play and improve their brain. I disagree with those claiming that at some level you must use money. I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

            "Incredible launcher!! I highly recommend! It gives your device such a smooth, organized feel. Plus, it looks simply beautiful. Also, there are an absolutely astounding number of customizable features included in the free version (which is basically ad-free as well). But since I knew I'd be sticking with this launcher for a long time to come, I forked out the one-time fee for the lifetime service, and now my customizable options are practically limitless! And I gotta say, it was worth every cent!",
            "I bought the Nova Launcher years ago and swore by it for a long time. Problem is, that launcher is stuck back in the times when I first bought it. Smart Launcher 5 is exactly what I needed to feel like I am using a modern launcher with modern features, look and animations. The free version gives you pretty much everything you need. I bought the pro version because it was 50% off, wanted to support the developers for a great product, and because there are a couple pro features that I'll use.",
            "Hands down, best launcher out there. There's even no competition. I've tried it all. Back in th days I had Nova pro and before this I had Poco. But this!! This is a whole new level!!! Downside is most of the good stuff are premium, but that's not even expensive for full time access, it's like 4 bucks or something, and it's money well spent. Keep up the good work! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "I am speechless at the amazing flexibility of this launcher. I know that I am going to pay for the lifetime pro at some point when I exhaust all functionalities! There is just one issue I'm having that I have not found a fix around: In the news page, for tech and gaming categories I get no news, instead there is a box \"index: 1, size: 1\". I would appreciate some advice on how to solve this.",
            "SL is awesome. I am using it for over 5 years now. It is (and was) the default launcher for me on every phone I have. I purchased premium only for ascetic reasons when ads were added to the free version. While updates are not abundant, it is apparent that the devs are considering feedbacks. The scrollable app page was a very much demanded feature. Finally it arrived and it is a breeze to use. It took some years, but I am very impressed. Now I have a powerful launcher with a lightweight UI."

            "Two aspects worth a mention; 1. You can get wildly different search results from the app and the Amazon website on a PC so if you're searching for an unusual or rare item you may miss out on options and choices in your purchase if you don't conduct a search on both platforms, 2. Searching by title for a movie on DVD very often doesn't offer 'DVD' as a category in the 'category' filters; it always offers 'Prime Video' however which is an unacceptable hard sell.",
            "Hi all! I am updating my review and hoping to report a new suggestion for the Amazon app. I like the new set up of filters on the top bar when shopping because I use certain filters on everything I search to find the best quality items from trusted sellers. However, the \"category\" filter option is too far over. It should be one of the first shown in the row. In order to filter for only items shipped and sold by Amazon, I must first select the Category. Please move the Category filter over. Thx!‚ò∫",
            "You're app and pc site will not allow me to see pages. I keep getting captchas and errors constantly. I can't shop on the app because of my vision, but because I get the same on the pc, I'm always having to delete and download it again. I can't shop the way I want if I can't use the site anywhere... I'm shopping more elsewhere because no one will help me. The rating system is also so deceiving. I used to depend on reviews, now it's a joke! Everything has gotten rediculous. Please fix it.",
            "This is the worst to search for anything or buy anything on! Doesn't allow you to choose the category you want and it doesn't even have a grid system so you can look at more items so it takes forever!! I only have this for updates on my shipping. This actually used to be a really good app about two years ago, but the more they update the worse they get!!",
            "This app is very easy to navigate & has never failed me. Customer service is excellent at Amazon... Only Exception was during the lockdown when you could not get to a real person through customer service & had to use email. The 1 thing that drives me bonkers is in the Subscribe & save section if a product is not being delivered especially if you have had it on a monthly basis for over a year , there is no way to communicate with anyone in subscribe & save to address your issues."

We are all different & \"one man's meat is another man's position.\" Any venue can have an, \"off day\" ditto waiter, receptionist, chiefs, etc. It's an 'over view' I seek, a feel for a place. NB: don't just read reviews of places - but also reviewers reviews! Be aware of 'planted' (paid) reviews & reviewers.",
            "Good with booking a hotel, bad for booking a flight on Tripadvisor. The reason being is that I look on a different booking site for flight prices, compared this to expedia and expedia is the best bet for booking a flight as their prices make sense to me. Step up your A-game in the case of booking a flight Tripadvisor please!",
            "The best app for finding your way around a new place. It has all the restaurants and is almost always reliable, and is very useful for finding other things like attractions too. I wish it would remember more things when you switched off the app (ie switching to WhatsApp and then back) as its a pain to have to find the page you were just on, but it's still really a great app.",
            "You ruined the app. It used to be my go to app for restaurants and hotels, now it can't even find a location less than 1km from me. Not only that, when I did pull it from the map (which is also wrong) it said it was closed. What a joke. Don't expect me to use this app anymore.",

Thinking it was an issue with my phone I uninstalled and reinstalled apps, lost all my boosters, silver coins etc the only thing that saved was the level I was at. Instead of being a relaxing game it's now really frustrating to play.",

If my booster is able to be used you cannot bc it kicks you out of the game. Why do you have us fill the piggy bank and then want us to pay for get the gold bars? They should be free. Why is there no way to win tickets to the circus? This game needs to be tweaked a lil bit and the cheating should stop. Just my opinion though.",

Then I tried the original bank account to send money. It keep saying cannot process try later. It's been three days and still now working. What a shame. I loved this app before, now I dont. Have to find another way to send money.",
            "There isno feedback on payments and I had to exit and re-open the app to see my payment was sent. The settings suck, if something is on and you want it off, the app starts linking your accounts instead of being an off or on option. Whatever you do, don't accidentally break their rules or they will ban you for life and not give you an appeal option. The parent company will persecute you of you treat anyone the way they treat their customers.",
            "I have had venmo since they started. I have not had any issues, I use it to accept payments. It makes budgeting easier for me as I use my venmo to make misc purchases that I don't want to use for my main account. No issues for me ever. I found venmo because originally I was with cash app. Someone hacked my acct and cash app penalized me and closed my account with no option to open again. Venmo saved the day! i love this app, my favorite part is the emojis!",
            "App keeps freezing and crashing out of nowhere. It still runs fine, but at least 2 or 3 times now I've sent money to someone and the app freezes while the money is sending. Only way to escape is by exiting the app through task manager. The money always goes through to the other person but this shouldn't happen. Also often the app will just freeze while I'm scrolling through transactions. Sometimes it resolves itself, sometimes it doesn't. Otherwise, I would rate this app 5 stars.",
            "The app keeps freezing randomly all the time, while navigating through it. It doesn't matter what I'm doing, it could be scrolling, tapping on something, etc., I have to restart the app each time. I also don't get notifications until I manually open the app. After which I keep getting the same notification again after I've closed the app!"

            "it's still buggy. getting worse, even. the more I use it, the more it crashes and lags. I would rather have that fixed than a new design. and now the coin purchase isn't working either, and sometimes tapping the heart to like does nothing. there was nothing wrong with the layout, please fix the bugs. I want to be able to read the comics. even now, I would like to be able to buy more coins and I literally can't",
            "Firstly, I saw many, many advertisements on instagram for this app and decided to give it a shot. And I'm in love with webtoon now. No joke. There are a lot of other web comic apps, but this one seems to be the only one without a pay wall from what I have found. You can buy coins to read ahead with a fast pass, or be patient and wait for weekly updates on many of the series. Overall good experience and lots of amazing stories.",
            "Honestly, while I do enjoy this app, I'm kind of annoyed that they removed the option to buy $20 worth of coins. That and I get they need to make money, but let's be realistic here, the whole \"one free comic a day of comics that are completed and were once entirely free to read in a day\" thing is kind of meh. You can pay to read them more often, even though the comics again were ENTIRELY FREE BEFORE. You wanna read a 70 chapter story? You have to do it over 70 days, unless you wanna pay.",
            "I love the contents of this app, but I can't ignore the constant glitches. One of the worst ones is that I have participated in 2 seperate events for free coins, and when I went to collect my reward it glitches and I lose out on the free coins. As far as I can tell there is no way to contact them when something like this happens. A Google search for support just takes you to there FAQS forum which doesn't help. I guess use the app, but don't bother with the events.",
            "I used webtoon nearly daily about 6 months ago, then my phone broke and I had to wait to get a new one. I forgot about Webtoon, but once I remembered it, I was excited. All my favorite storys must have gotten tons of new episodes. And then, the new Pass was revealed. I didn't mind fast Pass,Daily pass is stupid. Part of the charm to the comics is that you can spend 30 minutes sitting down enjoying your story chapter by chapter. Now imagine taking all of that away, to 1 chapter. Very short read."

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

Ha, Make it year 3!The best company in the States for service is MetroPCS by T-Mibile. Service, connection, and the people are great. X üíöüê¢",
            "I have appreciated this name id blocking unwanted calls until today when it blocked a contact of mine. Now I'm wondering how many other contact calls have been blocked without knowing...I hope this glitch gets fixed!!!",
            "I like it very much, however the 1 thing I don't like is the list of numbers stay forever. Also the old way 1 could check a number if one got thru. Is there anyway to clear the numbers in the activity sectipn? I have a list that goes back over 8/9 months. I use it often however still have the same problem with the ph. nbrs. Is there a way to delete some of the old nbrs?",
            "I'm so glad I have this! With so many scams I've gotten where I dont want to answer any calls but now, stopping them has been easy. Although, I wish it included text messages as well.",

Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen üëëeven when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "Fair warning- these guys are Grade A scammers. You know what's not fun? Rushing to turn in a paper only to have the scanning app you've been using without issues suddenly lock, with no warning, unless you pay them 20 dollars, just casually holding you hostage. In a panic, you fork over 20 dollars because what else are you gonna do? Anyway your paper ends up late, AND you're out 20 bucks. The kicker? They then ask you to rate the app. The only clickable option? 5 stars. These guys are dirtbags.",

There is nothing in here I get free. This is an outdated app that needs removing. Not to mention the malware it comes with that took forever to remove! Oh yeah and the hidden Neilsen Measurements app included free of no charge to spy on your every move. NO THANK YOU. MY CONSENT NEVER GIVEN.",

I have completed everything they recommend and even reinstalling this and still crashes. I have now lost all my lollipop hammers (10 of each). Messaged them (King) and not willing to help or admit there is a problem which clearly there is from others comments below. Very disappointed after all this time.",
            "Sometimes you can watch a video to either have a special candy or to get a few extra moves, however quite frequently when the watch video button is clicked, it just shuts the app down completely. It would be 5 stars if it wasn't for this really annoying bug. Please fix and I'll change my rating.",
            "Game is always crashing. Sometimes I don't get rewards after watching adds. Events never work. And it's impossible to contact anyone about it. I've tried and I got a copie pasted email back. Useless. Update, a few days after writing my review I lost all my candy ( the lollipops) that I've been collecting for years. Literally Year. Gone",
            "I have been playing this for a while now, and it does get tricky every now and then, but it is very playable . However this morning, when the game loads, then the level screen, then play, then watch video, the game shuts itself off! And then back to starting the app again, has this been caused by an update, as last night it worked perfectly. Overall my impressions are good, nice graphics, pleasing sounds, some levels do get annoying, but that is all part of the game, 85/100.",
            "Great game with lots of free treats. You can get stuck for 2 or 3 days though, even on a classic level,. 7 months later I'm still playing but now it switches off when I try to download an ad. I've taken advice to switch off my tablet completely but it has not improved. Pity because it's a great game."

            "Needs events or something to make power ups easier to get Some levels are damn near impossible without them and the gold is expensive af. ** love the game overall! Have been playing for a long time! I've made it past over 300 levels but this entire time it's kind of been a lackluster game compared to some of 'your' others",
            "Its always challenging to figure out how to defeat a level. The only levels I really dont enjoy are the ones where there are chains over the buckets and you have to hit a matching color \"face\" thing to open it and the \"face\" changes color and changes which bucket it opens.That one is too confusing trying to figure out the pattern without wasting pears to shoot.",
            "Simple and fun,but there are some REALLY hard levels that can take even days to beat,such a simple and long game shouldn't have such hard levels. There should be an option to skip levels for free if,for example,you fail to beat it in 10 - 15 lives or maybe even less.",
            "I click the little circle on the top right corner and it says to put my fb information and when I do , says invalid token access .. what does that mean? why can't I see which level my friends are on ? Please fix",
            "It's an entertaining and addictive game, but it has some major cons. You only get 5 lives and you have to wait a certain amount of time before they regenerate, even though this game is clearly designed to make you constantly fail and replay levels. 5 lives is not enough, a game like this shouldn't even be using the \"lives\" format, it just ruins the experience and makes me stop playing since I have no more lives. This game is all about luck, not skill, which is extremely annoying and lazy."

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can.

            "I like that it gives you the location you are currently located in, upon opening the application for usage. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because if you are on the AT&T network, it would make more sense to not need to have paid for a monthly subscription, and also because the basic mode, that is free of charges to utilize, but only if you do not agree to the upgrade charging your phones billing account, does not use verbally (spoken) directions, to assist the device owner, or individual using the application for navigation, to hear the directions; you must look at the device you are using to see the navigational directions in this application, which I personally feel is a contradiction to the \"It Can Wait\" campaign.",
            "this is a sleazy app. I just got off the phone with AT&t after finding out that I've had a 2-year reoccurring charge for this application. I have never used this app I only use Google maps, so when I ask for e-mail verification or some kind a verification where I would have agreed to the monthly charge they stated that sometimes it comes through text messaging so if you click on the link that is your agreement for your monthly payments. At least I got a $30 credit out the $240+ I already paid."

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game üëç‚ô•Ô∏èüëç‚ô•Ô∏è",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

I like that I don't have to listen to every single message. I can visually see who the message is from. I like being able to erase certain messages without having to listen to them every time. This could be a great app if you would FIX the problems. Seems like everyone has the same issues. I've been with metro for about 10yrs.",
            "Keeps sending me messages that say the app is \"running\" and the app will not synchronize properly. VERY ANNOYING. Metropcs can't figure it out. Tried getting them to fix the problem three times but they don't know how to do it!!! Will probably have to uninstall the app, lose all of my archived messages and pic's and reinstall to see what happens. Also, NEVER set your permissions to ALL! Doing so will let messenger change your contact list, phone call information, distributes private info also!!",
            "I n hoping this update haz fixed all its snags, it wont sync, it leaves a tickertsape note acrossmy phobe staging it \" keeps trying to connect to uou ,but cant get thru\"! Now i tried getting on the app on my phone but after setting my new passcode per the apps request , and using my phones last 4 numbers like suggested by app! Then it wouldnt accept the phones numbers, i have to call my phone to get into my VM\"s so the app really is worthless! Lets jooe it has been fixed or im dropping it!",
            "I used to be able to delete old VM's, multiple at a time. I don't have to listen to them but I have to click on each one individually and delete it. Why can I no longer select more than one and delete messages I know I don't need to listen to?",
            "Always been great visual voicemail. Where can I locate the 2020 update version? I received a text message from Metro to get the update. Thank you. Susanne"

DO NOT INSTALL. if you don't believe me and other people experience it yourself.",

            "Its a good app just needs to improve more and they should think of some advantages for the senders as the senders invest huge amounts in the app",
            "Do not download. The layout is confusing, invasive, and refuses to respond through their customer service email when they have no option to permanently delete unless you want to link Facebook, google, and your phone number. I didn't read the reviews and tried on a whim. Seriously, don't install it. If there were such a thing as negative stars or turds, this app deserve the lot of those. Has anyone successfully deleted their account from there?",
            "Tiktok is BY FAR better. I spent 4 hours trying to figure out this app, and customer service did NOT help. The app DOES have potential, but the problem right now is, there needs to be an entire rescripting of the English version of this app. User guidelines are vague and not well written. FAQ does not hold enough information. The 24-7 customer service bot is all AI and there is no actual person, unless they give you an email.. which I am still waiting for.. App is fun, but still needs work."

The problem is this app can't work in landscape. It always forces portrait mode and to use it I have to take my tablet off the holder which is pretty annoying if you have to do it many times over the day. Please change it",
            "A great way to clearly identify specific places on the Earth's surface so no more ambiguous descriptions like \"I'll meet you at the car park\" (where in the car park and which one of the four calf parks do you mean?!). Also it's fun and provides creative ideas. See what the space your front door occupies is called for example and see if that inspires any fun ideas!",
            "I cannot rate this life saving app highly enough. It's very accurate and reliable. I would like some of the users to consider that when under life changing pressure, and you have to think fast, speak in short concise accurate sentences amid chaos, in order to get help efficiently, remebering just three words, rather than a sequence of long numbers in order to get the emergency services to your location can make the difference between life and death. Thank you for this app.",
            "As an emergency service worker, I've used this app on several occasions to locate an incident and its proved to be invaluable. Fire, ambulance and police, along with all other emergency services and breakdown organizations can access the app so its a perfect location finder if you're out in the middle of nowhere, broken down in your car, fallen an injured and needing help. Definately worth downloading, if only to sit quietly on your phone until needed.",
            "Excellent Location Finding App - Lacks smart watch/wearable integration. I love this app, it's quick and simple to use IF you have your phone with you. If you're out running without your phone then unlike thousands of other great apps with smart watch integretion what3words is no good to you at all! In those possibly emergency situations when you want to name an exact location, you'll need to rely on Google Maps! *** Response developers: 3WordGo requires a login to an Uber account!"

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before ü§¶that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 üëÄ what kind of damage it will do. üëÅ suggest that any 1 should üëé load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",

Keeps turning itself off üò° annoying üò°üò° even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot üí©",

            "Overall, it is a splendid and very accurate GPS navigation (for BUS/TRAIN/etc specifically,) but I do not feel the app itself is updating everything necessary. I seen a bus or two that I am familiar w/ and I seen it besides me on the other bus that is visible on the app (however fast those things are updated,) but overall, I DIG this app ü§ôüèæüíØ",
            "The routes it provides are often not efficient. For example, I was doing BART from San Francisco, then bike to It's Your Move in Oakland. It told me to get off at Rockridge. In fact, it's faster and cheaper to get off at MacArthur, the station before Rockridge, AND that also shortens my bike ride by 0.5 mile. Another example, it didn't follow BART's timed transfer stations for connecting trains. I had to go through emails after emails with Moovit to get them to acknowledge the issue. Horrible.",
            "Great little app. Whether you need a route to walk, ride or drive this is the app to get you there. And they are good with keeping up with improvements. Great Job Moovit!!!",
            "Can't see when the alternate bus is due. Only captures next bus. Want to see both so know whether to wait. One bus quicker. Would be good to be able to save alternates for buses.",
            "Found this app after Google maps stop publishing public transport information.. Best app love it and i recommend to others who want to use it.. Best part is it actually remembers where you started from so you can return home incase you forget your address as a tourist.."

I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",

            "Good app. Finally showing room sizes in the search results. Please add room size filters to save time searching. Hotel star rating often does not match the real rating, for example many 5 stars properties are actually 4 stars or unrated. Prices can often be misleading as they do not include fees and taxes until the final step of booking, and then the final price can end up to be significantly higher. Final prices should be listed at early stages and we should be able to filter by them too.",
            "I made a booking and then I found a cheaper price though someone else at the same property. I tried to cancel the booking and have the cancellation fees waived and when it came time for me to hit the confirm the fee waiver button it went straight to cancelled for $65.00. I literally found the other price less than five minutes later and immediately cancelled the booking.......smh. Bad Business.",
            "Terrible app. Too many bugs to list, and I couldn't even write them to tell them about it because the Google Recaptcha just kept asking me to select images over and over again. Oh, and after trying 5 different times to book a flight, I got \"reservation failed\" with no explanation. One time, when I went back to reserve, the same flight I tried to book initially went up $70. Oh, and you'll have to scroll back about 420 times to enter your DOB cause you can't enter it manually. What a joke.",
            "Frankly the app is really great. I usually check the googles and find hotels online. Then i open up booking and compare prices. 90% of the time the mobile booking app has deals and tends to be cheaper by $10 to $30. Not much but that extra $10 can go towards a meal or something else like the mini bar. I love it and i recommend to all my travel buddies.",

            "It's a very good app, but the photo editing options are less. It would be very helpful if there more editing options especially in the colour option. Also, saving the pdf is taking a lot of time. If the time for saving is reduced it would be very helpful. Other than this, the app is great. I can smoothly share assignments using this app. There are no ads in this app which is great! Overall it's a good app but it could be made better by adding some more editing options.",
            "Good app. But this app tends to lag at times. Please make the generation of PDFs faster because it takes a lot of time and because of it, I could not submit my assessments on time. Though the copies were checked, but I had to listen to warnings from teachers. Please make the generation faster. Otherwise it is a very useful app and is handy too.üôÇüôÇüôÇ",
            "Finally we have a phone scanner that works about as well as a flat bed scanner! I've tried a few of these types of apps in the past, and they usually had issues. But this one seems to have hit the bulls eye on everything. The auto-detect borders almost always works, the adjustments are easy, the file size is reasonable, the touch-up/edit features work very well, and it doesn't erase your entire scan if your screen turns off because you had to step away for a second (like DropBox does). No complaints about this app so far!",
            "I'm using this to scan my answers to exam questions, then i make them pdf and send to my instructor. This is the best because I can select different filters for better look and legibility. When I pick a filter, I can shoot photos back to back without stopping and it will turn all of them to my selected filter. Also, it has auto-detection for documents. When I direct my camera to a document, it understands the context i dont even need to shoot or crop, it does everything by itself. Super useful",
            "my main issue with this app is that it cannot pick up each section of a certain document consistently, e.g I'll scan a document and half of it is very light and difficult to identify, while in reality it is just as dark as the other half of the page, though this may also be partially attributed to background lighting. nevertheless, this app simplifies processing and downloading scanned documents and for me, is more effective than a standard camera."

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "I wouldn't say its addicting or fun or anything. I'd say, it's good for people that just want a game, they don't care what game it is. I like it a lot, don't get me wrong, its a great game but everytime I play it, I feel like I deserve more. This game is awfully good but surprisingly bad. The levels do get a bit challenging as you move on, but with that, it lags my phone. Sometimes, when I watch an ad, it takes me back to a level I already finished, which is annoying. 3 stars because it's boring",
            "Your game is terrible, you only get like 10 moves. I would not download this, it takes up a lot of data. It is really bad. Please fix the moves, then I'll give you a better rating. I'd suggest you to not download this game before they fix this bug. I get strict sometimes, because I can't just find a good game to play when I'm bored for example: when I'm using a hotspot; when im on a roadtrip. Please fix this bug, then I might give you 4, or 5 Stars. And the Ads are constantly playing.",
            "Fun game. Ads are ridiculous and I am never going to watch an ad just to break one of the pies. For everyone out there, PUT ON AIRPLANE MODE. And also future apps, use airplane mode and never watch a stupid ad again. I will gladly pay $1 to remove ads, but anything above a dollar is not worth it. I understand why games need ads, but an ad forced upon you in the MIDDLE OF A GAME? Nope. I won't support that. Make removable ads a buck and I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "This game should tell us how many moves we have. Literally every other game that does something similar to this will tell us how many moves we have left. Is this intentional? I don't think it should be. Also, there is nothing fast-paced about this game. If you want it to be, maybe add a timer or different levels of difficulty if you haven't already. Each level of difficulty will give you a certain amount of time to complete the level. I'd enjoy the game a lot more if it was like that.",
            "VERY POOR, PLAY THIS IN AIRPLANE MODE! This games developers obviously want nothing more than an ad revenue. I will never understand how a game will make you watch so many ads just to get past 1 level. As soon as you score a whole pizza (every pizza) there is an ad. They don't even wait for the level to be completed. Not worth $2.99 for no ads."

Amazon should discontinue this app and port the one on FireTV as it has the X-Ray feature and Video Preview. The Prime Video App on FireTV has a much Clean and Decluttered UI and is pretty smooth although it does have dependencies on the core apps of Fire TV as that App doesn't have standalone login. (Even though the specs of my Android TV are higher than the FireTV 4K and yet the Android TV app lags a bit)",
            "- does not remember series, season and episode that was being watched which requires cumbersome navigation - can't properly restart already watched episode, since it starts at the end and almost immediately jumps to the next - does not save state when app is going to background, preventing easy continuation -owned material not shown on the start page even when recently watched With those fixed, it would be a good app.",
            "Was not able to install it on my new android tv. The website says registration is successful, however the registration is not recognized by the app within the tv. No proper error messages. Disappointed with my experience.",

I failed to do do and list all my customizations on a factory reset. When adding apps to folders, there is no search function. You shouldn't have to scroll through hundreds of apps to find one. Also, there is no way to start a folder without having two existing shortcuts already grouped to a folder."

            "Fun game...longest I have ever kept a game on my phone. LOVE that I don't have to sit through commercials in order to play or anything!! A few years, when I first started playing, I had the ability to win time...I miss that. Made it more fun to win an hour (up to 24 hrs) of free play time. Guess they lost too much $$ on people not buying items to help them pass a level. Oh well.",
            "I love this game. Great way to pass the time. I do have a couple of things. What if for every 100 levels you get one of each boost and 25 coins? Maybe bring back challenge of unlimited lives for a 24 hours? Sometimes it sucks when it takes 3 days to complete one level, it gets frustrating and boring. I have spent many hours playing this game and spent some money and do really enjoy it.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until it got to the higher levels (im on level 3564) I have spent plenty of money on this game because once you only get 5 free lives and when your out it takes 20 minutes to get another life. I understand the levels will get harder but I think its ridiculous to only get a new life every 20 minutes. I don't want to have to delete this app but I can't continue to spend $1.99-$12.99 just to be able to play continuously.",
            "I actually really love this game. there's no ads (!!!!!!) and there's really no need to spend money if u are patient. it's pretty much entirely luck based so as long as u are patient and keep trying u can pass any level. my only complaint is some of the levels seem unnecessarily hard which can get very frustrating but other than that I would highly recommend this game",
            "Play game all the time my only problem is that you have to continuesly have to update after doing 50 levels beyond 4000, and my Facebook friends dissappeared. Hey Doodle Bob I am a real person playing this game and yes I passed level 4000. I can honestly say, I have NOT spent any money on this game and do not plan on it. Just wait for lives to add up and continue to play."

They are turning what was a good hammer -- a simple, useful tool -- into a bloated, mediocre multitool that does everything -- badly.",

It is a great way to practice French in the holidays, when I'm not at school as my teachers can set class courses. I've also started learning Italian independently and all the FREE features have definitely helped. You can do so so much and I just wish I could write a longer review because MEMRISE IS INCREDIBLE! So much better than other language apps. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§",

            "Initially the app was the best that I could ever have...but just after 1 week it turned out to be a total mess... My phone became too slow, i received the notifications too slow, i couldn't hear anything on the call and the worst was that it automatically took control over the system and modified all my settings... I wasn't able to manage any app. It was really really too disturbing and disappointing.",
            "Being able to customise the icons would be a great edition like you used to be able to do. Getting rid of the prime or making it cheaper would also be better, with no ads popping up when I turn my screen on. Icon packs and more selections of themes would be great, along with being able to customise your own themes. Oh and the icons being closer together on the home screen along with 2 more app slots added to the Dock. If these can be added then you'll definitely get more stars.",
            "In the beginning it was one of the best launcher app but now it is the only worst app. You write any complaints, except the automated, you don't receive any reply from them. For more than 3 weeks I was trying to get some \"themes\" using the app. It opens but nothing shown and nothing can be downloaded. But the \"Premium\" page and \"Wall Paper\" page are working.",
            "I love it. Thanks for this application, now my phone looks cool now. And there so many theme's you can download for free. And i'm very happy because every time i use my phone that have \"cool theme\" it will give me a nice mood so i use it everytime now. But before i didn't know this app, My phone theme is so booring that's why i didn't use it a lot. So now i'm glad that i see this application on youtube post. Thank you very much. Sorry for my english. Heheh",
            "I have had this app for years. Now all of a sudden I get a new phone and I have to pay almost a $100 a year to keep the app. I\"ll go someplace else and look for another app. As much as I love this app. and would stick with this app forever I am not gonna pay $100 a year for it. Either take leave of this issue or loose a lot of customers. There are so many free apps. Out there. We don't have to pay a yearly ot monthly fee for. I would see a 1 time charge of a few $ but thats all."

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "Pros: Usually a little bit cheaper. Cons: Takes a long time to get a ride. App looks and feels worse than others. Other: Had a promo where they'd give you a voucher if another rideshare was cheaper, but refused to honour it, despite all instructions being followed. So wouldn't recommend on morality grounds as they don't seem to care about their word or their customers.",
            "Worked fine the first time. Easy to set up and use. Then i tried to use it again later that day. Kept telling me that i needed to confirm card details, even though i had said i was paying by paypal and it worked fine on paypal earlier that day. I took the time to confirm the card details, still gave me the same error. In the end i just used uber. Uninstalling - I need rideshare apps to be reliable, not make me spend 10 minutes working around a buggy app when im in a hurry",
            "Have had the app for 12+ months, nil issues so far but could be improved. Recommend. Pro: usually cheaper than other apps Cons: can b difficult/long wait to find driver, esp outside of normal hours, or outer suburbs. Also, drivers OFTEN accept then reject last minute- frustrating & no compensation offered. Comment: worth having simply to comlare against other ride share apps, and for use in city areas during daylight hours (more reliable). Despite above, my experiences have been positive.",
            "Absolutely the worst app I have ever used! Everytime I try and book a driver it comes up with \"system error\" tried updating the app and still not working. I will happily pay more to use user, at least I can actually book a ride!!!",
            "It takes forever to find a driver and then when it does they don't follow the map taking longer than necessary to get to the destination then charging me more for the trip. This app is a joke."

            "Really good game, I been playing it for two days already and I love it. But something happened: it lagged in my home and it's seems I can't move. The screen moves, I can craft and destroy blocks but I can't move. I made a new world and it works just fine, I'm kind of sad that I'm losing everything from the first one, since I made a lot of progress and I had a lot of things. I will try to play again in the new world but if the problem happens again I will rate it lower",
            "I FOUND THE GAME FINALLY. This game was my whole childhood. When I couldn't afford Minecraft, I would play this, and I remember spending hours building things. If for some reason you can't spare 10 bucks to get Minecraft, this is definitely one of the better rip-offs out there. If I could recommend one thing however, maybe implement a feature that would allow you to transfer worlds? I would be very curious as to what the world I spent hours making looks like.",
            "Very good game, good graphics. D game is cool cuz u can go to other dimension its so cool like this is d best game ever. But am rating it a 4 star bcuz in other mine crafts u can fly but this one u can't fix that and also make a setting to on/off d zombies and creepy things so u won't be scared when playing. If ur reading this download d game cuz its cool download u won't regret it.",

Please let me know why it is happeningüôèüôè",
            "Old Minecraft gamer- Needs auto filling in the chests so you don't get left with 5 things that can go in one stack, the bow is pretty useless even if you get amethyst bow... It doesn't shoot far enough and takes too long/awkward to draw. Other than that it's pretty awesome, although a world map would be very very useful along with having the compass."
