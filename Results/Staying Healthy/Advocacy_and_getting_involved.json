        "description": "NYAS stands for the National Youth Advocacy Service. NYAS is the leading national provider of advocacy for children and young people. We also provide advocacy services for children and young people in Wales. We provide lots of services and some services for adults. Our main service though is advocacy for children and young people. NYAS is a rights based charity. \r\n\r\nIf you are a care leaver, in care, have been told that there is to be  a child protection conference about you, if you are disabled, then you have the right to an advocate. You may be entitled to an advocate for another reason. We also provide mental health advocates if you are unwell and in hospital. \r\n\r\nAn independent advocate will help you to be heard when important decisions are being made about your life. An advocate will go to meetings with you if that is what you want. They will help you to talk about your wishes and feelings. If you find meetings difficult they will support you. Sometimes they will go to meetings for you if that is what you want. An advocate will help you to start, change or stop something in your life. They will also talk to you about your rights and entitlements so that you can make the right choices and decisions about your life.\r\n\r\nThe free NYAS advocacy app gives you direct contact with the NYAS helpline if you need an advocate. It also contains useful information about what your rights are if you are in care (including mental health settings), if you are a care leaver or if there are child protection issues about you. It is a quick reference for professionals too about advocacy and the services NYAS provides.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n\r\n•\tRemote access to NYAS helpline wherever you are – this means that if you have a mobile phone you can contact the helpline by phone, email or Skype. You don’t need  Wi-Fi to use the app. If you email us and want us to call you back, we will do this. Our helpline is open 9 a.m. - 8 p.m. Mondays – Fridays and 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. on Saturdays.\r\n\r\n•\tInformation for young people about getting involved with NYAS – At NYAS we have a Participation Team who provide opportunities for young people in care and care leavers to be involved in the charity and to develop their skills. For example we have trained young people as peer advocates so that they can then go on to be professional advocates. This gives them something to put on job application forms too. More information can be found on the NYAS Young person’s website at http://youngpeople.nyas.net\r\n\r\n•\tInformation about NYAS Legal Services – The legal team at NYAS support children and young people when their parents are in court because they cannot agree about which parent should look after their children. NYAS is asked to represent children and young people so that their wishes and feelings are taken into account in these proceedings.\r\n\r\n•\t Information about staying safe and links to relevant websites – It is our responsibility to make sure that you are safe whenever we are working with you. We will keep confidential what you tell us unless we believe that you may not be safe, or that another child or young person may not be safe.\r\n\r\n•\tFurther information can be found at www.nyas.net  and http://youngpeople.nyas.net\r\n\r\nFollow us on (Twitter icon) @NYASServices and (Twitter icon) @NYASFundraising\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow us on twitter @NYASServices and @NYASFundraising",

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

The very first thematic event - slay your enemies and get a whole bunch of unique weapons, player skins and many more!<br>• Never miss a start of an event or new quests with the updated notifications system.<br>• Updated radar behavior when crouching.<br>• Improved performance and bugfixes.",

            "This update will give you seizures. I have no idea what you are thinking Response: when running. The screen appears to be twitching more than the character running. Made my eyes water up , I can't play anymore : good luck 🤗 And to all future players. If you see VGA:top or any other. Just leave. I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",
            "Love the game can't seem to put it down. No problems with my iPhone! The graphics on this game is amazing its clear not blurry like those othe war games. You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

Minus: getting notifications and info on all the stuff I don't like at all (looking at you UFC). Wish I could select what things I don't want to see. Minus x 2: very often when I tap to open an article, it goes to a completely different article. This happens probably 20% of the time I'm on the app.",
            "If you want to read an article it will work...sometimes, or it will just give you an article that it decides you want instead. Want to stream something, sure, just get comfy as it buffers every 20 seconds or so whether it's your mobile device or you PC so a college game takes 5 hours, not that you can seen it properly because of pixelated buffering. This doesn't happen in any of my other streaming services, just this. Worldwide leader in sports, dumpster fire of digital media.",
            "Too many bugs. Many articles do not load completely and some just load the first few lines and then nothing but vertical lines. It's a mess! The loading issue was fixed, but now the article links take you to the wrong story. Streaming is ok, but it does drop out too much. Update: loading issues fixed but the links are always messed up. Clicking on a story takes you to a completely different story.",
            "I have the espn, disney, hulu bundle. Espn app works 10% of the time. I'm constantly trying to log into my provider to watch live TV. Tonight I tried to watch a college football game on espn3. It keeps telling me that Im not authorized to watch the stream, which is false, or it can't authentic my provider. This is more than annoying. I pay a subscription for your app and it doesn't even work right have of the time.",
            "Update: October 9. Still buffering for pretty much everything. I just download stuff over night and watch offline. Recently, sound is not synchronized with video. Really hard to believe how bad this app is. Original post: Even with measured 200-300mb download speed, the app buffers repeatedly. I don't know if it is a server side issue or the app itself. However, I can only rate my app experience as average, at best. And, compared to services like Netflix, it is far below average."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

I've rebooted my phone, I've cleared my cache, I've turned off my VPN, I've cleared my junk files and my residual files with Norton Clean, and I've deleted the game and reloaded it, NOTHING WORKS.",
            "At first it was okay, $4.99 packs then $19.99 packs to help you advance, now mostly everything is $100 packs. I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. 👎",
            "Have played this game for a number of years getting very discouraged game will load for a day then close spontaneously during the loading process. They tell me its my phone but when others have the same issue. I'm seeing they only want money not fix the issues I'm down grading my stars to a 2 because of technical issues without fixes and it has evolved to a pay to play, pay to win game.",
            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",
            "I played this game all the time on my samsung phones. Very fun game to keep up with. Now I'm on my oneplus 7 pro and nothing loads other than the all text boxes and buildings. I can't transfer my account because I don't know what I'm pressing. This is one of few games I have spent money on, I'd like to not lose that account."

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

            "You should also add an option where users can sell their unused equipments to add in their funds so that it won't turn into waste after upgrading. And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

Save yourself from frustration.",

So I tried once more to add a person to my family tree that they had recommended and it still tells me to upgrade so what the hell is the 129.00 for ? Now I am in a dispute to get my money back that should never had been taken. They suck and I actually rate them negative 10 stars !",
            "The site makes it hard to cancel the free description. They make u go thru 4-5 pages & u have to fill out your information & number & keep asking over & over for extra confirmation to cancel the free trial. That's so aggravating. Also, the site didn't show my family in Costa Rica, seems like it only can search in the United States.",

I'm using the UK version so maybe people will have a better experience in other countries. Update I have logged in several times through the day and all show as sold out. I also do not understand the new piggy bank, how do you collect nuts and bolts?, how do you heist from other players?",
            "It was good. Then it was not so good, introduced piggy bank... A way to spend tokens in hopes of winning more. Prize was tokens and blackjack hands. New piggy is worse.. I don't even get tokens, just get jerked around by the piggy. I know I will never get the last nickel to cash out at$10, doesn't bother me, liked the gift cards. I know I will never get anything from the piggy. I just keep coming back hoping I will get one last gift card. And I cannot find your help center.",
            "Worst app ever!!!. Once you are approaching the minimum withdrawal then they won't give you any cash anymore and, I am just 0.15 away.They just let you watch a lot of advertisements over and over again. I won't recommend this app. Now they have an update to heist from some other players too. Nah it just goes on in circles over and over again.No withdrawal has been made.I have been playing it for a while. Highly won't recommend this app.",
            "Waste of time. Period. Deleting now with no regrets despite being $0.25 away from cashing out (For 1-2weeks of multi-daily check-ins to the app). My gut says I'll never see a dime and my time is better spent elsewhere on games and activities I actually enjoy. Download at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you! Edit: After that response, I'm confident that I'm right. They make vague and empty promises so they can make more money through their scam.",
            "Has been slow for cash payouts but I have gotten a few gift cards.. Now this app sucks. Doesn't pay out. You get enough tokens and all of a sudden its sold out... used to be legit. Beats paying for scratchers but man change the payout system back to what it was a year ago and I will change my rating back to 5 stars. Took a legit app and made it a SCAM or just near damn impossible to get any gift cards. Fun to pass the time but doesn't pay out anymore 🙃"

In this game one thing that i don't like is that the sound of the kart during the moving . Except this all the things are vry nice . I enjoy this game while playing. I love this game.",

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",

The strong players always attack the weakest player, there are already enough strong player in every city so there is no chance to grow up free or with small amount of money. I am playing this game more than 6 months and without paying i can't grow up. Don't waste your money. This games is only for those who can invest thousands of €€€€$$$$",
            "I liked the game at first, but I started having a bug in my game that hinders me from playing. I have invested alot in this game, and I thought it was going to be great. Instead, I have not heard a response from the company to help resolve my issue. I tried contacting through the game, email, Facebook, and even called a phone number that is disconnected. BEWARE DO NOT SPEND MONEY, BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET HELP IF YOU CAN'T PLAY BECAUSE OF A GLITCH!!!!!",
            "I really like this game. But there are more problems. people are seen able to attack people and their truce don't expire. With every update, the game lags, then freezes before minimizing itself now. And 99% of the personal event rewards are not worth doing! Fragments are a joke when won. Especially for the yellow ones. And the buyable packs need a lot more in them to be worth their amount. City Chat is still not monitored! Do something!!!!",
            "I have played games similar to this but i gotta say i like the mafia thing. The game is fun by itself with the story line and evrything. But it is a little more fun when other people participate in the clan. But it defitately keeps my mind busy when its trying to run wild. Love the game though, lots of rewards also!",
            "I just installed the game maybe half hour ago, after 4 \"error\" during the install. Middle of playing (still tutorial part) it randomly stopped and pops up that it was updating at stuck at 40% for 10 mins. Closed it, assuming my phone was being dumb and now i have not been able to get back in the game. I get a black screen that keeps minimizing and refuses to play :( i have family who play the game so was really hoping to play, but this much bs already is not comforting start!"

The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

It has other Awards that you can win throughout the game, little side games you could say, in which all adds to your \"coins\". Great Work peeps, in the Making of this game!🍭🍬🍫👻",
            "Almost impossible to complete monopoly game. Need 1 Free Spin. 500 spins later still no free spin. The Game knows the challenges you have to complete. And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",
            "This is by far my favorite slots game. I like the weekly competitions and side games. I enjoy the interactive slot games, all the oompa loompa slots on all levels. With they had it where you could use real cash. They would be F****** awesome...",
            "Very expensive to play. Trying to hit daily and weekly goals has cost thousands. More expensive to play than a real casino slot machine. Promotional game wiped out points with nearly 600 near-consecutive losses. The Zynga algos are geared for max losses.",
            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

            "I love this game! They send free credits throughout the day. Of course using premium level and 4 cards is the best. But I've gotten bingos off of one card. Really have to try this one 🥰 10/29/29 Grumpy Cat is the best ever room. You definintly have to try it. Win clothing items, dress him up, take pics I share them in my FB story. GRUMPY always makes me smile. Seriously give him a try you'll be glad you did!!",
            "I loved this game, play it everyday sometimes 2 or 3 times but after the update its always crashing on me. I had over 100 chips this morning and every game I tried to play it let me buy the game, start playing then freeze until it comes up game over. Im not playing again till this is fixed - a shame as it would have been a 5 star review last week ☹",
            "Wonderful game. Tired of having credits taken away every single day lately without the benefit of actually getting to play. Frustrated! Looking for new favorite game if support can't fix this issue. 🤬 I reach out to support and all I get is information on how the game works. No refund whatsoever on my credits. What a joke.",
            "Great game for bingo lovers, I play every morning with my cup of coffee and some Bingo Bash, love the game but getting annoyed with the gifts every night it comes thru get your gift and you hit the icon and no free surprise its been going on for weeks now, i play every day and do spend a good bit of money on chips, please tske a look or fix or I'll have to lower from 5 stars, i do love the game but very annoying",
            "I find it boring now. I love playing mini games as Rapid bingo or Grand tour. I always loose all my chips in rapid bingo. Very few times I won otherwise always loose chips.From last 6 months playing Grand tour but not won 300 chips reward. So stop playing that also. I find your team is only interested who put money. Those who play with free chips, your team don't bother. Now I feel depressed while playing this game, while loosing the chips. Earlier this game was my favorite."

            "It's a good game, but only if you want to spam cards, been on this game for a couple years now. I've come and gone and they still have things that make it near impossible for non pay to win players to progress. If you want to progress you need to get powerful gear, a good way to do that is events. An event that requires a 300k gear score will one shot people with a 1m gear score. If your not looking to progress and just want to chill with random people, it's a good game to be on.",
            "The fact that I've been playing this game for ever since like four years ago and they still haven't fixed the neverending \"Now Loading\" screen is just... honestly, disappointing. You're forced to exit the game every two or three quests you do and the devs haven't done anything to change that. I came back for the sake of nostalgia but it's let me down once again. Annoying.",
            "The general overall experience of the game is good. Recent updates have however caused regular issues in game such as freezing and dodgy connections (which yes u have tested and aren't just my signal). The company clearly puts a lot of thought into new things to add to the game, I just feel they need to address bugs more because since the last lot were added, it's been months with no change, yet loads of new content for them to make money. Clearly their priority is money and nothing else",
            "Honestly, I fell in love with the game a few years back. I still enjoy it to a certain degree, but some things have been bugging me: 1. There are some minor glitches like people or monsters not loading. While it seems innocent, it becomes really inconvinient for Guild Battles and stuff. 2. Even though the devs tried to solve the issue, it's still an issue. The stronger the monsters, the more broken it is. Unisoning in Guild Battles is still broken as such. Please continue to resolve the issue!",
            "The game is pretty nice. The customization feels great and streamlined; easy to learn. One critique is that with more money, you can easily progress faster than everyone around you, akin to the problem Clash of Clans has. The gameplay feels nice and natural; along with the fun guild battle system. If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to customize the party you quest with. I.E. Choosing whether or not to allow other CPU's to come with you. Overall, great game, fun time."

            "Literally, BLOWN AWAY!!! I have never experienced a game like this. Deer Hunter is so basic about hunting in such a beautifully detailed environment. And the Events are just amazing! Every single thing in the game makes it more special to play everyday. It stands apart from the crowd of other hunting games and expresses itself in such a beautiful way. The graphics are totally awesome, the mechanics are convenient and the Western music keeps my enthusiasm up! Just change D.H 2018 to 2019. Thanks.",
            "I love the game but can we get more energy like one every minute and why I love it the hunting is great and the dogs are good but can we get more heat in the suits, and more chum, bait, and fishing energy please make the wepons cheaper oh and it takes a while to load but I think that it is worth it please make these improvements.",
            "It's a fun game, I highly reccomend getting it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I get logged out of the game whenever I try a mission in a different region. The main problems for me is the loading screen, it's so long, I have to wait like, 3 minutes to be able to play the game. I don't really mind the ads, they aren't very annoying, and the game's scenery is kinda cool to look at. Overall, it's pretty great, it's my go-to game to install whenever I get a new mobile device.",
            "Great game to be honest. I love hunting the animals and it gives me a surreal experience of hunting. But as soon as you hop online to competitive shooting things take a turn for the worst, people can't compensate at getting better so what do they do? They hack, ever since I got into cts it's been hacker after hacker scoring near impossible scores like 30000, 70000, 50000 etc please fix this, make a program that bans all hackers as soon as a hack is detected and never let those goons get away.",
            "It's an awesome game. It's like real hunting just on the go!!! Its a really fun game, nothing to complain. ITS AWESOME!!! Its still awesome in 2020!!! 5 star city!!! Huntsman101 level 7 region 2 in about 15 min"

            "I loved the game at first I even made it to level 50. However, after months of playing the game investing my time and money it rebooted and made me start over from level 1. They took away my home and Sims family. I was so disappointed. They have since fixed this problem and returned my level and items. I love this game.",
            "Ok. I like this game. But one thing that i really don't like is that they don't notify us of new updates in the game. I would have to go to playstore everytime i suspect there's new updates. Sometimes i would have missed more than a week during an event before i update and i miss good products. So I really hope they would change that and notify us within the game. Otherwise i love it.",
            "I love the game but some things are still quite annoying in it, like the challenges, some are impossible to get unless you make use of real money to purchase sim cash. It think they should make the challenges quite easier to win reward becos some people can't always afford that. I am also hoping to see pets and cars in the game. By the way nice one EA and Maxis",
            "Quite good mobile adaptation of The Sims game. Enjoyable. -- Problem though: My Sim is female but Izzy designed male clothes for me on the first try, and still male on the second try. My starter Fashion Gems all wasted since females can't wear male clothes. Suggestions: 1) make Izzy able to detect the current Sim's gender or allow us to choose. 2) State the requirements of player's name so that we don't have to keep guessing why it gets rejected.",
            "Have all sims in collection. All great only complaint in this game is the loading and the none selling of items in storage.Be good if could add more sims. Over all great game. Am enjoying it. If the situations were resolved i would give a 5 stars. cheers.."

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

And you cant go into houses any more so fix that and maybe add more superepowers I know iT says rope hero but its boring with one power thank you keep up the good work",
            "I love this game so much that I can't tell!!! My sister plays it too and it's so lite to install but I don't have any money and sometimes it's even crash and freezes so I'll rate four star",
            "The new game is good i did most of the exploring it was good Maybe can u buff the speed of all the cars. they are really slow and weak acceleration I whould very like to rate this game 5.5 star Just buff the acceleration for all cars",
            "It's no doubt I am huge fan of Naxeex games! But i have a problem with this one. I spent 75k currency on a robot delivery,& quickly exited the game (to go on another app). I return,the mission I was playing was no longer active,the robot that i ordered disappeared & the 75k also gone. I bascially spent 75k on nothing. I know you can't necessary fix that but i needed to give an example of what players deal with. The game is amazing but the amount of lags and glitches can really ruin everything) :",
            "This is my favorite game now!! I love it! The graphics are cool even though its at the lowest graph! I think you should develop the game more! And i think this is more like GTA SA but everybody is a stick! Really love this game, naxeex! Edit: you should add multiplayer and also street names."

            "Great game! A good time piece for lockdown. However... the new update rolled out today and I am on of the 1 in 5 males who suffer from colour blindness. The new darker colour scheme does not work for me. Will it stop me from playing? Probably not, though the previous version was better suited to my disability. It would be good if the developers could look at winding it back. Naturally there are a few bugs in the new version also, namely trying to play another game. It freezes on my Samsung S10",
            "Really good for the CS fans. Few bugs, about the final tally and lag in the game. Rest, still online game, it feels like AI or computer or bots playing the game. Difficulty level can be increased. Secondly, making squad and playing with friends is the issue.. We have to restart game after every match.. New update, people are hacking it easily.. They are not dying to head shots also.. Nevertheless grt game.. ❤️❤️",
            "Latest update is really bad. It has lot many bugs. Please fix all the bugs soon or Revert your code changes to previous version that was really good and stable. It is not allowing all the players to be in the game. Sometimes only 2 or 3 including CT and T. And sometimes only one player. LOL. How can we play with ourself.",
            "You have ruined the game after new upgrade.. listing down few problems.. - It's taking too much time to join the lobby and teams r not balanced after joining and sometimes no one else is joining. This is most serious problem. U hv ruined it. - Players r joining in mid of the game. - CT has also bomb after team flip..lol - No option to exit the game after joining the lobby. Many issues with UI",
            "Additive game. Critical Review: 1.sometimes don't starts properly saying network issue, despite network is perfectly ok. 2. Latest oct. Fancy UI upgrade made the game slow. Kindly make sure I was using ultra high quality video in previous version and game was working perfectly. In the recent version even high quality lags. 3. Games works at medium quality but it's very irritating for eyes. Feature Request: Add live voice intrection with others if possible."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

But in all the consept of the game is child friendly but not whith 2 yr olds. Dose anyone else think its wired that you can be a HUMAN!? And no I can't hold my breath for more than 15 seconds thank you very much. I just realized this got random. Well have an awesome day! 'Put a bannana in your ear ' - Jason Steel",
            "The game is very nice to play and good for passing time ,but there is one big problem. The problem is that there are much adds.Only 2 adds of thrill rush and uphil rush are repeated before a level. I am bored because of the adds. Please fix this problem as much faster as you can.",
            "This is very nice game😇 but the reason I gave it 4 stars is This 👀, sometimes it stop working in easy words you can say it become hang😔😔and it takes very much time to start😴 or you can say it takes much time for downloading 😕other wise this is good game 😍you must also download this game😋 it doesn't let the people's bored😏 this is the best game for fun😝 ,enjoyment😜 , happiness😛 and for free time too 😃",

            "Started playing it, thought it would be 3D or as advertised but it isn't, never mind that, game is too much for my device, way too many things happening. Plus the tutorial is so long, I ended up just building and upgrading things I don't know. In fact all the building made me want to play Sim city, if they designed it that way it be enjoyable.",
            "The only reason I am not giving this game 5 stars is that there is no reward for those who don' t spend a lot of money. All events pull you in to spending money - its a choice, I know but can't some events reward perseverance, loyalty and time? It is impossible to be ranked in anything without spending. The difference in players is obscene. In our kingdom (798) it is impossible to survive without being shielded 24/7, which costs. Saying all that, it's bloody fantastic!",
            "Great Game but only way to Play is to PAY !!! If your short on money this game is definitely not for YOU !!! You can play the game without spending but it will take you forever to build. And you will be constantly being farmed by larger opponents healing your troops and losing your resources. Better to Play a one shooter game or download solitary.",
            "There are several issues with this game. First when tapping the bar to increase resource amount then it maxes it out. This caused me to loss all resource I have gotten so to attack because there is no real good way to get shields that I have determined. Alot of stuff to build that really does not help you at low levels. They say it is used as you get higher level but is very inconvenient at times as it feels like you are missing something. When you are killed you very little resource back even",
            "I really liked this game at first until y'all decided to start charging more and more for everything. Honor pass used to be 2 bucks, then 3 now you want 5 for it. You charge people to get the items just to try and play some of your activities but then you don't even give them enough. And the glitches and bugs? I've had millions of resources removed from my account, I've had issue with claiming on prize packs in my messages. It's ridiculous because no new players are added to our kingdoms ever."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "This is the best baseball game on android. Unless someone can suggest a better game, I'm sticking with this. It is not hard to adjust to the controls, and you don't even need to spend real money to build your team, so just be patient and keep getting the free 10 gems. Also, learn to work the count, make the opposing pitcher wear himself out. My current team in Master II is a beast, and unbeaten towards the end of the season! If you need a great baseball game on your device, MAKEIT THIS ONE!!",
            "This game is 5 star for lots of reasons. It's got great graphics, great gameplay, and great competition levels. The only reason why I am writing this review though, is to give you some ideas for future updates. The biggest thing that I would love to see in the game is Wild pitches. It would be an amazing add the the game. Also, more celebrating after stuff. Like, when you hit a walk-off or win a league. If all of these things were added, I would have put 6 stars",
            "OK Look. This game is fabulous. Its amazingly fun. Its really great! Try it out!!! But the only problem is that its really hard to get gems to customize your stadium, uniform, or logo. I have still had the same default uniform, stadium, and logo for 1 month now and i play the game every day... Otherwise, its good.",
            "The game was good but I'm not sure if it's getting to higher levels or not but there are way too many line drives caught especially by the 1st & 3rd basemen. It seems like 75% of the outs are line drives and not enough lines drives that are his unless they are doubles. The game isn't enjoyable anymore unfortunately.",
            "I like this game because it's Baseball. But I hate how your players get tired every 2-3 games and you have to give them energy drinks. That happens constantly. Also, I'm ok with losing here and there but there should be no reason that I lost 11 games in a row even though everyone on my team was non injured (I just noticed that today) and everyone is in perfect condition and is not tired.

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

            "Edit: After contacting support my problem was solved. Thank you, McAfee I paid $30 as a special fee for samsung users only to find out that my subscription is a trial. Then I had to subsribe for $14/monthly to upgrade it to standard membership. Would have been cheaper and easier if I had just purchased total protection from the website. I hope unlimited number of device protection is still available",
            "I'd give them ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ because the app itself generally works fine! But... there is a failure that irritates me a lot..! The MS App lock feature..! I understand that applications should be locked, if I want them to be locked. But come on... it is a bit too pesky when you have to unlock them every single time, over and over, even if they were minimised. Please, add a feature/possibility to make some apps stay unlocked in session. Thank you.",
            "I've tried the rest so I can say with experience that this is the BEST mobile security app on Google Play Store! Unlike the other apps their malicious website detection is superb. It actually detects suspicious sites before your browser can visit them & blocks you from even going there. Competitor's apps only detected 50% of malicious sites. VPN feature needs improved security & IP masking because the Plus hefty fee increase doesn't justify it.",
            "Can't access mcafee account after updating app and had no help from developer, except got redirected back to the app after which my code was regiven, only to be told by the app it wasn't valid and I payed for a year to be able to use the full app service, no other option to renew for another year was given either, what is the developer doing, give me the run around, so I give 1 star until problem is resolved. Thanks.",
            "This app is amazing. I brought a new laptop and I got a McAfee Multi Device Subscription for up to 3 devices. I loved this app because of its simple interface, real-time scanning and anti-theft. I can also backup my contacts and media in it. It improves my machine performance and provided me high security.

            "Something is wrong with this game. Almost nothing works and I can't even tell what most things are supposed to be. There are no instructions. No labels on buttons. I was able to find a few buttons that did something among all of the different screens but that's it. One dramatically increased the coins per tap. I then tapped for quite a while to see if somethijg, anything, would happen. Nope. Especially frustrating as the buttons do behave like they are working. Art style is nice, unique.",
            "Itd be neat if there was a button that stops the story slides every time you reset Also (might be my phone not sure) I cant always access the leaderboards Also I think the pets and or backgrounds shouldnt get repeated unless having multiple give some boost another thing it would be nice if master beggar stayed active or paused or maybe like half speed when you go over to other tabs rather than just not letting you go to other tabs and a master beggar upgrade that costs gold potions would be cool",
            "Good app. The grammar is a little bit bad. Not all. Please make a free coins by watching ads. Also the potion. Please 5 or 3 potion per ads pls. Thankyou. Your apps is good. Edit: TY for reply. Hm I also want to ask if can you please make a button where we can on and off the thing below the trainer, i mean the option. So we can play it full screen. Its hard to click when phone is small. Please. I really really love your app. Im willing to watch ads to support you guys. Hehe. Staysafe!",
            "Amazing game! I've spent about $45 on it and I have to say it was money well spent. The grammar's a bit off, but I believe it's the translation. It's a tapping game, you can earn potions to benefit you (or buy them), you can hire people once you get enough coins to get money for you, you can customize your character, the background, and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Overall, really great game!"

            "I love this game and play along...I would rate a 5 but they could do a better job with explaining things...and having races that would help finish the cars you have ... I am stuck because I can't get components...",
            "Pretty good game and it's not completely pay to win. Only big issue for me is recently it won't load me into the game. Only fix I've found is uninstalling and reinstalling the game for it just to work for a few hours. Only started a few days ago so hopefully it gets fixed. It first started when I customized a car and it kicked me out. EDIT - Changed to 5 stars because the issue got resolved and no longer does it.",
            "This is a fun and exciting game. But my frustration comes from the inability to get some cars needed for events. Everytime there is an event, it requires me to purchase the car with an asinine amount of money. The game doesn't even afford me the option of spending in-game currency to purchase these elite cars. My only options are spending $20 for 1 car or trying to get it by the rare imports which is impossible. The only key you can use to get a car is a gold key and even then it only component.",
            "After playing this game for a couple of months, I started to enjoy it, playing 20-30 mins each day up until I could not get into my account, every time I tried to get my save data from the cloud it would just start a fresh one. Contacted support, and the reply was\"we are aware of this issue, wait for the next update\"2,3 weeks later still no update,I will not wait months on end just to be able to play a game. The good thing is that I didn't spend any money on it or I would have regretted it."

Free stuff daily don't have to spend real money to advance. Keep up the good work developers!!!! Best fishing game on android. 5 stars across the board!!!",
            "Really love the game, however like most app games you have to pay to get anywhere. New Halloween event? Pay for a pass to get better prizes. New challenges, pretty nice, if they didn't run entire days of legendary fish that most people don't have. I'm sure there are more casual players that enjoy the game, that wouldn't mind being rewarded. Just a thought. Recommend for wasting time. Progressing or competing, not so much.",
            "this game was fun at first, but it is just a money pit now. The events are only attainable by those with fat wallets. And when the game goes down for more than a day, they give you a booby prize as compensation. Won't be spending any more money or time on it. My advice is don't play unless you're rich and famous IRL",
            "Was brilliant. Have spent over £100 on this game. It's a fix!! You will constantly keep spending money. You'll never have what is needed until you spend, spend and spend more. It lags, freezes and you lose items you have paid for for this. I have contacted them and nothing!! Or they state nothing is wrong. Completely disgusting. What a waste of money!!",
            "I was on level 59 entering 60! Played two months & was winning big, smooth clan, and BAM! Game Updated & started me completely over! Customer support wasn't available to help me get back where I was. Im not starting over at level 1 again. I put too much time n effort into this game. I was logged into Facebook account and Google! It didn't save my process! So I'm deleting the game! Good luck new players. It will happen to you. I was starting the Halloween theme! It really socks! No game 😕"

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players..

            "this game would be getting a lot more 5 stars if it wasn't for those damned ads. i got an ad on loading screen on my 1st game. if only the devs weren't so greedy, then it would be a really good fighting game for mobile phone. but on it's current state though, i wouldn't recommend because of the egregious monetisation.",
            "It's all around a decent game but the dodge button and the training buttons for example for speed the hit boxes are too small If you don't hit them dead center it won't register I have lost and almost lost plenty of matches just because the dodge button didn't register",

Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

            "Constant pop ups wanting you to purchase. You have to say no to 3 ads in a row before you can spin again. A few spins later...there they are again. Hit what they consider a \"big win\" which can be quite often and guess what??? AD!!! Wanting you to multiply your winning by paying $4.99. I played for maybe 5 minutes and had to say \"No\" to so many pop-ups that I am uninstalling and never playing this game again.",
            "LOVE this slot game! I play a lot of slots, but usually delete them because you don't win and barely get enough in the daily bonus to keep playing. This one however is perfect! Lots of fun slots with different exciting bonuses on every slot (which is a must have for me, I don't like basic slots) and you ACTUALLY win! I LOVE it! Easy 5 star rating (:",
            "Early still, but it has cool slots and at least if you lose your ass, you can watch ads to earn yourself back into the game pretty quickly. That's a huge plus for me. I absolutely hate slot games that give a crappy bankroll to start and drains it in no time just to try to sell coin packages. We'll designed and big game selection too. Keep up the good work!",
            "I haven't seen \"buy this\" pop ups THIS awful since the late 90s just before pop up blockers were made to stop the disgusting greedy bs. This developer needs to get a grip. I was getting PAID to play this and try it out and I'm doing it is THAT bad. They need to rethink their policy on that. For real. Someone on their team probably deserves to be fired for this not happy nostalgia, this needs to stop. 100% trash till then. Update: just bc there's an x doesn't make the avalanch of pop ups okay.",
            "This game was great after I paid a couple bucks for a purchase to make ads go away (been playing nearly 2 yrs). But now, the Level Race and the Winning Cards are super annoying and interfere with tournaments. I get that you want to give people other options to get more coins, but you should also give players the option to opt out of these things. I buy the coins on my own and being harassed by these constant pop-ups is a deterrent. Once my coins are exhausted I'll likely just delete the app."

            "I have played this game for 6 years now (even though I have had to start from the start again due to getting a new device) and I think it's just a great game over all it's always got something new for you and it never gets repetitive! (Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",
            "10/10 my phone isn't the greatest and even with such high graphics and quality it is lag free. Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game. Used to play it a lot on my iPad a few years ago. I'm biased a bit cause of nostalgia lol.",
            "My experience with this company is misery, i personally have had over £40.00 in credits to which i have been passed from Google play store and the game builder time after time. I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",
            "It is a very good game, but the energy thing is pretty stupid, that and all the guns almost cost good and there is pretty much no way to get gold, other than that though great game! Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

            "Bed wars...kind of fun game but I only have one problem from the game. The joystick, when I always walk on the bridge (The one with wool that players can buy from game) it always go to the right side of my joystick!!! So I fall down when the joystick let me go to the right. Please fix this bug!!!!",
            "Ok so I got this a few days ago and have already seen hackers and people braking the game. Although it's a very fun game and you will have alot of fun playing. It would be better if it had the creatures or ender pearls(preferably both). And make to where it's one of those games where its you die in the first 3 Minutes of the game. If you fix some or all of these issues I will raise my rating. Other than that I enjoy this game very much so. It is worth downloading.",
            "Sometimes I wonder why this game is still up. I can't even count how many people I see hacking, breaking the game, and more clown moves. And the game producers have done nothing to fix it. So it is really annoying playing the game. But I can't stop beneath all the stuff I listed it is a really adictive game which is why I didnt give one star. But if these things dont get fixed I would rather play something else.",
            "I love this game!!!! it's soo fun..in the real Minecraft bedwars the swords,fireball and more cost ALOT of iron ,gold , diamonds and emeralds and it's harder to PvP so this game is better!!! please make more game's I love this too much!! I hope everyone is doing well and happy in carona virus (covid 19). 🙂🙂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🤍",
            "I only tell honest reviews. This is mine for this game: This game is probably one of the best games for android outside of Minecraft for blocky graphics. It has a very Minecrafty feel to it and I really enjoy playing this. Congrats to the developers. It has every basic weapon that ordinary BedWars has and then some. I also enjoy that everything works like it does is real deal Minecraft. Definitely a good pick."

            "It's great and I'm surprised it's better than I expected it to be, honestly. But... There's a problem when logging in. I have 5G and full service and a good processor in my phone, and it runs slow when trying to connect when starting up. So it's not my phone, because fortnite runs just fine and I assumed it would give me a lot of problems. But the initial start up is what's troublesome, other than that, great game.",
            "This game is fabulous however there are some problems associated with it which are needed to be fixed in order to make it better. Firstly, its greatest problem is that we enter in those MP matches which have already started, this squeezes all the fun out while playing a match, it was fine earlier but now it happens too frequently. This problem is a major setback here. And secondly, in BR matches its frame rate is a major problem, it is not as smooth as MP matches. So kindly fix this. !PEACE!",
            "The amount of content that you guys are trying push, sell, advertise is what will ultimately drive users away. Keep the design simple man. There's more menu's on this game than a PC game. Stop it. Also unbelievably huge game. It's not enough to download the game. You have to download maps, camps , weapons, modes. Just stop. I gave the game 5 stars earlier. Now it's filled with junk",
            "New updates still can't play the game. Nothing but buzz sounds and then kicks you from the game. Awful experience. Even if you wanted to play every day you can't. Don't waste your money. First experience with app was amazing. Now there is so much lag the game isn't even fun anymore. Okay haven't been able to play game because the game won't load. Just a weird noise and game shots off. Nothing but garbage!",
            "I've never experienced a mobile game so welll made as this. Truly exceptional. I think one of the greatest features of this game is that you don't need to spend money to keep up with multiplayer game play. The game rewards you for playing for free!! Which is unheard of at the level of quality this game provides IMO. I have cricket wireless, and I play about an hour and a half a day for the past week or so and I've had NO ISSUES. not only that but the game doesn't even go through that much data!"

Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks. When the items are in trash, my heart starts beating hard and in tension, please make it unlimited storage or atleast make it more able to store items. 10🌟....",

Furthermore, my phone is not old as I am using the latest phone from Samsung and I do not know what is the solution for this problem. I will be pleased for your suggestion. And by the way I am a huge fan of this company. I am still currently playing many of your games such as Real Steel, WWE Mayhem, Zombies Deathmatch, Into the Badlands and much more.",

But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",

Update October 28: Now you can't even upload pics because it's says the permissions are incorrect, even though they are correct. How useful is a dating app that won't let you upload pics?",
            "Nothing free about this, from the moment you sign up, they're trying to pry your wallet open. You can't see who likes you or who is messaging you (unless they're paying). If you want to do a subscription service, just do a subscription service. Don't tell people it's free when it's not. Even the worst freemium apps give you some time, but this app hits you with a paywall within 30 mins of signing up. The other dating apps are bad, but this is the worst of the lot.",
            "From 5 stars to one! The latest version is so buggy as to be almost unusable. It takes now takes an inordinate amount of time to go from Alerts to Carousel, and from writing a message back to a picture. Writing a message does not show up in a timely manner. More errors exist but you get the idea. Do yourselves a favor, reissue the previous version!",
            "I have just paid £25 for a months subscription which is supposed to include unlimited messages but other than \"liking\" someone's profile I can't send any written messages. Also just found out the \"liking\" is also limited to a certain number a day & everything I try to do I am hit with a upgrade message wanting more money from me. Is £25 for the month not enough for you? Obviously not because for that £25 I have nothing!",
            "Downloaded the app and tried to sign up. I got a message that said \"the action could not be completed at this time\" so I tried again only to be told that I had already signed up. I tried to reset the password I was never allowed to create and received an email that had two different link that took me to blank pages that never loaded."

If you can catch the ways to play early. You are a winner. Though it won't make you in very top. But still i am enjoying it and i can be in rankings enough though i don't pay. You just need to learn how to play. Its amazing 😁",

The graphics are the only redeeming quality of this game. They aren't bad but they could be better. The ads aren't accurate at all to the game. Please don't waste your time with this game. EDIT: Your bot replies are stupid and pointless. Make your game actually fun and maybe I'll give it a second try.",

Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",

            "Used to be good, but after the recent update you can't collect enough resources to advance the game unless you pay. Edit: the reply from the game rep is innacurate. I had plenty of resources, almost enough to upgrade and the next day, everything was gone and have never been able to save any resources to play the game, let alone make the game easier.",
            "I was enjoying it but I'm tired of always being lowest might in arena. Everytime I upgrade drastically, magically when I join another arena match, everyone else doubles and triples my might. I literally took all my gear off and my might was 35k and everyone in that room were 100 to 300k, I waited for rounds to end and equipped my gear which had me at 326K and then everyone was 550k to 725k. Complete bs. Yep, definitely a money grab game.",
            "Odds of winning items and the rewards given are getting poorer as the GREED for money grows. I play but have lost interest. I quit spending hundreds to get everything. If money is no object you will enjoy. Support services are the worst. Robots with no helpful info...just scripted responses. . I lowered my review for the lame scripted response you added to my comment. It doesnt work.",
            "1. The game glitches way too much 2. The game crashes every 20 - 30 minutes while playing it 3. Its a pay to win game 4. Its so slow loading and loading 5. The game sucks U should have a 2builders from the start and the limit of 5builders, And have a competetive fight only your level can fight you, because i play it then i challenge some raids, after it resets there is a 1.5m powered guy And I only have 200k power, how am i supossed to beat that?!",
            "Mobile Crusader kings meets building combat games like SoS. The gameplay is a mix of those two, really grindy and very much aimed toward wallet warriors. Can still progress f2p but really slowly. My game experience is hindered by long loading times and lag, didn't matter if I used my phone or gaming rig with bluestacks was still slow. Takes forever to load in and any pvp. Frequently, my commands aren't even done due to lag."

            "Game's good and all. Haven't played it in a while and now they've expanded it by putting Felix Kjellberg's home country. Which is Sweden in it as Region 65. More guns as well. Like to experience more guns. But thing is. Make it to the point where I don't have to wait till I'm in my early 50's to play. Everywhere I go it's a damn turtle to get to. Thank you!",
            "AWESOME,been playing on and off for about 3years or so, it's a never miss,always great hunts and hidden area's,,,only recommendation I would ask of developer's is to put more hunts in each section to get you the silver,gold, and red coins to be able to get the weapons for each hidden area hunts,,I think all would be ok with more type of hunts in each sections of unique animal's,to get to the hidden area's hunts,in those sections there are awesome animal's to go for,great game,🇸🇯",
            "Meh. Graphics are ok. Controls are a bit erratic. Some of the levels are designed to make you spend energy. Would give at least one more star if the reload button could be moved a bit. It's almost on top of the fire button. So, sometimes you reload instead of shoot. Costs you more energy. That you pay for. Videos for useful stuff are unavailable. But, videos for other things are available. Tiny bit of a money grab. Unless you are extremely patient and like playing for 15 minutes at a time.",
            "Overall an enjoyable game where we can watch videos to gain gold to advance in the game. However..after a couple of weeks the video stopped...so I cant collect gold anymore... Is this your way of forcing players to spend money to buy the gold coz without it its impossible to advance... Gonna wait a few days and see ...if still no video...sayonara to the game....",
            "Awesome. But, what algorithm is the game development company using to ensure that the prices we have to pay as consumers, is worth the gameplay we get for the dollar amount you're forcing ? In other words, prices need to desperately be discussed as a team. Not the best \"bang for your buck\"."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "It's a fun game most of the time. Addictive, too. But sometimes the game seems determined to take all your coins back, and I don't know if that's on purpose to make you buy more, or what? Edited: After gaining more experience in the games, and winning quite a bit, I do appreciate the \"lifelike\" experience, but still find certain things a little frustrating, such as a challenge to get 40 Sloto Card Stars to complete my Daily Dash, and taking until 11:59 pm to be awarded enough Cards to finish.",
            "GLITCHY THEIVES! The game was fun until it started to glitch! Then the reels would spin and not stop. I updated it hoping it would be better but it just made it WORSE! I tried to turn in my stars for a spin on the Super Wheel, not only did the wheel not stop spinning but once the error message appeared my cards and stars were GONE! I didn't get any prizes for them or compensation! Like I said, GLITCHY THEIVES!!",
            "It's good that there is no ads to worry about. The game flow is fine. But if I decide to put money into this game I find no real gain from it. Game goes into immediate lockdown. It will run me right out of the coins I paid real money for. This isn't a real casino. I dont stand to win real money. If I pay for chips I expect to get a boost out of the game instead of being shutout. Not a good business model. You can change your algorithms on your game. Make it worth players time. We pay. You don't.",
            "As John Goodman says you never know what today will spin! It is an exciting game, the graphics are great and you are not constantly interrupted by ads! I count some of the people in my clan as friends, we play as a group on challenges and it is competitive fun! New games and challenges keep it fresh! Once you play Slotomania, you will not want to play other slots games. It's that good! The seasonal games and prizes are terrific! Grafics are terrific!!!",
            "I'm through buying anything in this app. Real life happens to everyone. In the last three days of NOT buying, I've received a star spin in half hours and hour spins ONCE !!! can tell you when I was buying, it was almost Everytime spin stars. They let me know how they are I'm a level 2679 !!!! I'll still play with my clan, but No More Buying !!!!!"

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "Your game is so sluggish!!! I have a good internet speed but ms keeps on going up to 400. Come on! Do you have any plans to have it fixed? Your developer had made so much effort to make the CGI best but your server I think is the one the sucks. No wonder Mobile Legends has higher star rating than you folks. Try to have it fixed and y'all see the difference",
            "I really liked this game! It has many features and good heroes and skins. I loved this game. It needs some improvements here and there like in equipments for example you can remove the very base equipments like mana gem etc. And make a specific equipment for everything like only one for massive CD reduction ,So that it could be simpler for new players. I really loved this game they have tried very hard to make this game. Really deserves 5 stars for their hardship. Thank you and stay safe. ♥🌸",
            "Hey... I have a problem whit the game, every time I open the app (when I m the menu ) the game stop. I press the buttons , nothing happens. It happened before when the big update started , but now is worst. Is frustrating because it's happening every time when is a new update, but now nothing looks to work. The support system is been changed and is not very helpful for the gamer's ( the old one was better ). Thanks.",
            "The biggest problem with this game is the overwhelming number of clickbaits in the main menu. There is just too many things calling for attention, and all of them seems hungry for money to me. Moba gameplay is fine, not so different from AOV and MLBB if you don't consider passive level up as a strange thing. This game is reeking of China, it's not a bad thing but for a global audience this type of clickbait interface is just bad. Please improve your UI, it's just horrible."

            "The game overall has a pretty original concept, its fun for all ages. It also releives my stress. Theres a few things I dont like but ill give it a 4 star because this is a pretty good game.",
            "Great concept but it would be great if you had two separate skills for two different modes (Solo/Practice, which is the one we have now, and real multiplayer) TL;DR Great game for airplanes, but multiplayer needed.",
            "This app is wonderful!, i play this game after online class and this is a huge relief that i found these games. However there are a couple of fatal flaws, firstly. Ads, ads and ads EVERYWHERE. This is a pet peeve, and i need to turn off my internet just to have peaceful gameplay. Secondly, the bots. Its suprisingly EASY to get past all the stages. Maybe add game modes? Like battle royale mode, a hard mode. Make it challenging once in a while. I don't find this app good or bad, its pretty decent.",
            "I like it, but I got a glitch where you fall in the water and don't die. Fix This! (Son of Claire)",
            "I LOVE THIS GAME. They fixed all the bugs that are in the game. Plus they even have more skins. The only thing is that they make you watch a stupid add. I know i know. You get money bye doing that but come on eith this many adds. But other than that. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉"

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

It happen if I try to watch an ad, when I collect my battle winnings, also when I rearrange my whole layout. Please fix these issues. I want to continue playing, but im getting over it real quick with the constant shut offs.",
            "Great game, I have been playing about 3 months and I am really enjoying it. However, recently I have played for about 5 minutes and then get kicked off and it loses everything I did in that 5 minutes. Maybe its just me but if not I hope that can be fixed and if so, it deserves 5 stars Edit: Have had response really quickly, deserves 5 stars! Thank you...problem solved I think it was just me",
            "The experience is wonderful but there is an onjection in my point of view, it so happens that the game crashes at certain points of time and needs to be restarted. It is very annoying and it happens again and again. I think its a bug and can be fixed. Please do fix it and it will turn out to be the best game that there was and is.",
            "This is an amazing game with awesome graphics and equally great gameplay. I just started the game about a week ago, and it ran fine. Yesterday it crashed a few times and was kind of annoying, but I forgot about it. Now, the game KEEPS crashing as soon as I hit the X for the first pack thing it shows you. I simply cannot get into the game and it is SO frustrating. Please fix it Ludia, because I know it's not my computer.",
            "The games nice. It's just that when I watch the ads that allow you to skips some time, it crashes on me. The ads completely stop working and the screen sometimes turns black. If you wait long enough the game kicks you out. Please fix this glitch. I wanted to skip sometime to quickly get my dinosaur. Last thing, anyone reading this, try to avoid the ads as they might crash on you. I have a S9 so it's weird how the game is crashing on me."

            "Way too many updates in too short of time. And unnecessary changes to try and make the game harder. For example, you used to be able to pick up an enemies gun by just being close to it, now you have to be on top of a weapon just to pick it up and they made throwing a knife harder, used to get 10 knife kill per match! It's a decent game! My 1st 2 to 3 years of playing this game i had it rated @ 5 ⭐'s but now that they made these unnecessary changes, I dropped it down to 4⭐",
            "Fun to play against people who might be better or as good as me, very competitive but fun. I enjoy seeing new items in the seasons shop comes out because of the accessories and weapons. Its a vs game as we know however I like to play to win most of the time. The controls are simple and over time its gets better because of playing so much. #funtoplay",
            "I've been playing this game for years. Word of advice - Don't buy ANYTHING! I was ripped off for $27.99, and $13.99. I didn't get what I paid for, and Customer Service is ignoring me. I had no problem spending money on this game before. It's harder earning money during COVID, and I decided to spend some here only to be completely ripped off. Don't download. Play Call of Duty instead.",
            "TURN FOR THE WORSE. I've been down since day one, when it used to be fun. I get there's going to b updates and programmers will attempt to satisfy everyone's needs and desires, but as I look thru the comments it seems that most players arent happy with the gameplay. Matchmaking takes forever. Upgrades on guns are difficult to come by. The extra perks for each level of fighting is difficult to understand. It was better when it was just all guns straight up and that was it.",
            "I notice a bunch of people call this game pay to win. It really isn't, they're all just bad. I'm pretty high up there in levels and haven't spent a dime. The game actually feels quite easy. Controls and gameplay are alright, the graphics aren't that bad for mobile, and the items are that busted. All around, it's a solid FPS pick on mobile."

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that 🤭)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! 👍🏻😍😄😁"

            "Its a really good game, the two reasons I chose 4 stars is well.... lets just get right to it, number 1, when i get on the loading screen it kicks me out and thats happened all the time. But if go in it again it works. Number 2, im kinda sad that the part-time-workers from beggar life are not there :( But otherwise everythings amazing!",
            "Bit Grindy but overall good but I prefer the first. It gets pretty boring after a little I suggest I little bit more action. Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",
            "Amazing idle game. It's like other idle games except it has buildings to purchase. A city you can go into with multiple things to do. And not filled with a ton of ads like Alot of other games. I personally love this game and the people who made it. Well that's all. Great game.",
            "Dev replied with game requiring \"minimum rights\". Here is what they want from you when you start the game. Storage game data, view and manage google drive data, associate with personal info, see your personal info including your email address and your public data. Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live. Change it to cloud saves like every other idle game on the app store that is 4 stars and up.",
            "Some ads are just a picture with 0 seconds and the game thinks I did not watch an ad, so I get 0 mana (failed to view ad) Please fix! I am really enjoying the game. I cannot read the price for the upgrades, it is to hard to see (blue + green) Please make Blue and Red, I cannot read the price for part timers!!! please fix, will give 5! thank you"

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

The makers off this game did a really good job at first.but i beat the game without spending money but when you get to the top you play against a supper bot you can't go around over or away it won't let me and blocks are happens out of the blue you designed a game that was indestructible.but i kicked you ass and so you can win .that is full shi_ and your game needs to cheat so you can't win 0 stars.",
            "Interesting but wayyy too slow paced. Theres not enough players online so it take forever to match up in multiplayer to earn coins and the \"story mode\" has a waiting time for every match which is wayyy to long. Both of these make earning credits too hard in the game which makes it too slow to progress and increase your skill in the game. Developers should add another way to earn credits that doesnt have a limit or waiting time.",

It has one most worst point in which it allows to play only at when time arrived in case of offline and another point is that in case of online playing u player won't come soon it Will take lots of time and sometimes it won't connect also.",
            "It's a really fun game If it had more specific players like a libero, a setter n ace then it would be amazing also make getting coins easier if it's through ads or weekly packs n stuff then it will definitly be a 5 star game i really hope you add these features cuz it'll be truly awsome!",

            "The Game is frequently updated to force players to spend money - alot of money - if they want to be competitive! Otherwise progress is painfully slow. With frequent updates glitches are generated which destroys enjoyment of the game. Slow the update rate down, and give the smaller castles (with little spare cash) time to catch up with the 'big boys'. If not more players will leave in droves and the kingdoms will become more stagnant than they currently are! You must prove the game environment!",
            "The game can be fun, but do not play unless you want to spend money. It requires a lot to be able to play with any kind of semblance of a chance. There are people who spend so much money that you can never ever ever ever keep up and that means you will always be dead in the water no matter what. Edit: Typical response by developer which does not address the issue which is that they encourage this behavior with the way they do updates and game play is implemented. Docked one more star.",
            "Not really a fair game for new players. Peace shields are limited and don't last long enough. Kill events literally end your passion for this game. They need to enable a join feature not an FFA. I cannot beat a kingdom of 30 when I just joined 1 week ago and am at 10. As soon as I pop shield, homophobic and racial slurs blasts the announcements. TL;DR new players gets CC'd and if you don't let others attack you, you get abused with controversial slurs. More work needed.",
            "It is absolutely awful that I've been forced to tap and follow some stupid hard to follow \"tutorial\" that isn't teaching me ANYTHING because of its poor design literally dozens of times FORCED TO TAP WHAT YOU WANT and STILL can't turn that God awful \"music\" off or the sound for that matter. This is extremely horrible and the \"story\" isn't even going at a pace or way I feel remotely like I care to be forced to tap through either. It's terrible. Really terrible.",
            "Been playing since the beginning and this game is a dumpster fire now. Constant updates that make it more more expensive and introduce more bugs than fixes. Also they like to reset major aspects of the game so they can charge you for features that you already had. And if you contact customer service they will tell you whatever is broken is supposed to be like that. Don't waste your money"

            "This game is actually very fun to play. The controls are prettyty easy to understand and it is perfect for people who wants to play a strategy game while also thinking of how to manage their movements and timing. Just one thing. I suggest a new trap to be added into the game. Maybe a yellow guard where it moves diagonally instead. Overall, exelent game. 5 stars!",
            "As a strategy maze game, it's fun, but only when actual human beings design the mazes themselves. There are several dungeons/mazes that were clearly not conceived by a real person, & there's no way to report this. Also, the game forces you to take a three hour \"time-out\" if it thinks you've been playing too much. There's absolutely no warning, no countdown clock, no \"five minutes to go, wrap it up\", nothing. AND you only get 45 minutes of protection after being raided. Other games give 16 hours.",
            "I put 3 becuz I have new ideas to make this game perfect... I wish, u can control the thief on ur own and I wish there's more traps so it's more challenging, and the last is, I wish I can edit the ground like an obstacle course so it would be amazing. and that is all, bc that was i thinking when I installing the game but it wasn't... :( I still play it tho, I just want some changes to the game. I was going to put it 5 but I put 3... So I really wish u can change the game a little bit.",
            "Was fun at first, but you can tell where people fudged their dungeons to always win. Also the fact that you can't see that some people have it already a sliver of a chance to win before you start. It's kinda a waste of keys. Idk how they get it that small but I'm seeing why I Uninstalled it a couple years ago. Plus the fact that if you respin you almost never get the gem even if it's a 50/50 chance. I spent was too many trying to get one and it's stupid. I've already spent too much money to try.",
            "whenever you watch adds, it still say watch add to do something even though you already did and you also dont get the award most of the times you watch adds. also it takes forever to save a hard base and to save you have to do it two times in a row"

Theres no way in progressing on your islands anymore. As for cards you can always fill one section but you never in whole time ive played get chance to fill a booklet as the cards are dealt unfairly . So am close to deleating this app.",
            "Not giving me ny daily bonuses or anything prizes at all, wont give me any extras when i land of them or anything at all for at least the past two to three days and its making the game to where i cant get anywhere else in it at all and making me just want to get rid of it all together and i dont really want to have to do that because its taken me a while to get to level 123!!",

            "This is my favorite truck driving game, good controls, challenging, lots of fun, the only bad thing is while you're driving the ads that pop up at the top of the screen and stay there while you're driving makes the game lag so bad you can't hardly control or play the game ,So if you could Please fix this problem, I would Definitely give 5 stars",
            "The game is okay. But there are a lot of ads. The controls are hard because they are so small. The triangles for turning are okay but they are tiny so it makes it harder. Half the time i try to hook up to a trailer the truck and trailer collide causing damage on the truck and it wont hook so i have to exit out of the game to reset it so hopefully the next time i watch 5 ads to get in it will hook to a trailer. The game iver all is fun but every time i stop to get fuel, at the scale, or to sleep",
            "When you try to hook up the load most of the time it acts like your hitting something or your truck just goes right threw the load, very frustrating!! And you can't see the red lights even when zoomed in, please fix these problems! Other than that great game, I will give 5 stars, when fixed, thanks.",
            "The gameplay is superb. But needs some improvement in graphics and make it a bit more realistic. The game also needs 6-lane roads and new places in the map. Overall this has the best handling among all the other simulators. Also, everytime I go to Nashville, I'm charged with a speed ticket, no matter how slow or how fast I am. I have been playing this since 2017 and still cant get enough. Although now a little bored with gfx and maps.",
            "Couldn't play the game for more than 15 seconds without an ad. And why would I want to pay for an ad free experience if I haven't had an opportunity to try the game. Also, the game requests access to contacts, and wants permission to make and manage phone calls which seems odd for a game like this."

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

        "comments": [
            "Game play is fun. However, I feel like they don't do a good job of matching up teams, and the fact that it costs so much for decent weapons. Gold rewards should be higher, and weapon costs should be reduced. I shouldn't have to play for 2 years to earn enough gold to purchase a decent weapon. *update* Since posting this things have changed a lot. The crates that cost 5 gold are finally giving me something other than my 5 gold back, matches are more evenly matched as well.",
            "Weapon upgrade method is good after new update. But what seems to be human hands moving from the ground is not good at all. Because it's against the game being real. And the weapons damage rate is very high. There is little chance of recovery. Control is a bit difficult. And the sounds are unbearable. Over all the game is much better.",
            "This is a great game except for a few major issues which are: 1) the game play is glitchy and not smooth, 2) your aim is constantly getting thrown off if the enemy so much as moves an inch, so you end up missing most of the time, 3) the aim help is no help whatsoever, and 4) every time you are hit or an explosion goes off near you, your gun is thrown around which just compounds the aiming problem. I dont understand what the problem is because Modern Strike Online by Azur has no such issues.",
            "I love this game. I've been playing it for so long and I really appreciate the effort they made to make it more balanced and fairer overall for free-to-play players. But the problems is there supposedly is a gmail that supposedly listens to players' suggestions, critics and problems but I've never got a reply regarding my matters. I really hope that the developers can fix that issue otherwise this game is a must-play and is so enjoyable. I still really appreciate it if I get my problem fixed. ty",
            "I must edit my review to better reflect the real issues this game has. The main issue really isn't that it's pay to play, it's not. It's the match making. The match making causes under upgraded and developed players to be thrown into combat with waaaaay more upgraded players. I like the upgrade system, but perhaps ditching it for a tier based system would work best. Or perhaps adapting the upgrade system to a tier based system would work best. In this way, you can then match make by tier."

            "You will see s lot of comments from people in regards to logging out of the game with a healthy chip balance only to log in the next day for them to be gone. I'm afraid this is common with huge, many people I know on the app have had their chips stolen with no reimbursement, myself included. 3 years ago they changed the lottery. When they did, I had 3 gold and 1 silver. Today, all that time later, I still have 3 gold and 1 silver. Do not waste your money on these in particular!",
            "Things are looking up. Still hard to get Gold puzzle pieces, but maybe that will change too. I hate the pop ups, but I gotta admit, I do love the games. I recently had an issue, and usually if you complain, nothing get solved, but FINALLY, Huuuge took care of it. Like I said ,things are looking up. I believe in giving credit where its due. Keep it up. Diamonds are useless, I wasnt looking or asking for them. GOLD PUZZLE PIECES is what I was talking about. I havent finished a GOLD PUZZLE.",
            "Even with fake money to be won you'd think the slots would at least keep it interesting so you can play for a bit. It's a major rip off if you spend real money. Also they've tightened the frequency of acquiring a bronze,silver or gold puzzle piece. You'd think they wouldn't be as tight as real slots since,after all...it's fake money. So for that... I'd give it less than one star if possible.",
            "Everyone do not even waste your time on this game, Its fixed. Its designed to make you spend your hard earned money and there is no getting ahead in this game. The very start you win a lot and then once you get into it, they take all your coins. You bet $200. Spin 3 times and win $5 ..its so obvious. Then if you email them and or write a review, some homosexual will respond with something so retarded like, keep trying maybe your luck will change.. trust this review and just run away. Its trash",
            "If you want a real view of this app doing its job look on YouTube for huuuge casino (huuuge ripoff) it is designed to prey on individuals who spend money make in-game purchases. If you spend a dime on this game youll regret it. It has good games but the expense it ridiculous and idiotic. Based on real slots well real slits pay REAL MONEY you dont but your game requires its players to pay to play. Or you could use your 2 spins worth of (freebies) a day.... dumb!"

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "Great game...BUT! Had issues with this game a year ago, but thought I'd give it another go. Graphics and game play are excellent, however I bought credits (AU$70), bet big, won free games (Where's The Gold) then the game froze. Restarted it, recovered the game then froze again. Restarted it, same thing. Third time it just took the free games. No reply from support. You bet big with the hope of winning free games, then it takes away your prize.",
            "This app has the best graphics....but thats it. I've tried buying credits etc to 'pay my way' for better payouts, but all Product Madness are concerned about is making you pay more for something worthless. There is no way you can win any money back, its supposed to be for fun, but you have to pay big ongoing premiums to have any 'fun'. Until l see a better return on the money I've paid so far, they'll not get another penny out of me. You are better off saving your money for real gambling.",
            "I keep wanting to give this game more stars, but they just wont let me. Yes I'm very happy that you put way better values on the daily wheel. Yes I play this game because the games are ones I've played in real casinos...i can't give more than one star because you just make it impossible to win anything...when you go through 5 million coins betting minimum and never get a bonus or win anything higher than double your bet you just want to give up. Plus, the cost of buying coins is ridiculous.",
            "I think its great , you know it costs them money to put these games on here, so to anyone that's not happy just remember these games are free, and entertaining , And it takes our minds off of today's problems, Tomas blanco",
            "Total scam. Fixed games and they expect you to pay for credits? Games don't pay, stupid and totally unnecessary side games (open boxes for items or scratch fixed lottery tickets). The only good thing about this app is that the games look like the real deal but the overall experience is terrible."

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

Will you launch epic wars and conquer the entire world? Or rise up as a virtuous leader renowned for your sagacity? Will you set off to explore the unknown as a pioneer? Or dedicate yourself to helping your own people?\r\n \r\nOnly time will tell...\r\n \r\n**Features**\r\n\r\nReal-Time Battles\r\nBattles are not pre-calculated but happen in real time on the map. Anyone can join or leave a battle at any time, allowing true RTS gameplay. See an ally being attacked right in your backyard? Send some troops to help your buddy out, or launch a surprise counterattack on the attacker’s city. \r\n\r\nSeamless World Map\r\nAll in-game action takes place on a single, enormous map inhabited by players and NPC characters. No isolated bases or separate battle screens. Never before seen on mobile “infinite zoom” feature allows you to transition freely between the world view and individual cities or barbarian outposts. Map features include natural obstructions such as rivers and mountain ranges and strategic passes that must be captured to gain entrance to neighboring regions.\r\n\r\nEleven Unique Civilizations\r\nChoose one of 11 historical civilizations (more to come!) and guide your civilization from a lone clan into a great power. Each civilization has its own architecture, unique units, and special advantages.\r\n\r\nExploration & Investigation\r\nThe world of Rise of Kingdoms is covered in thick fog. Dispatch scouts to explore this mysterious land and uncover the hidden treasure within. Investigate lost temples, barbarian fortresses, mysterious caves, and tribal villages, gather intelligence on your enemies, and prepare yourself for the ultimate clash! \r\n\r\nUnrestricted Troop Movements\r\nNew orders can be issued to troops at any time, offering limitless strategic possibilities. Launch a feint at an enemy city, then circle back and meet up with your alliance army to capture a pass. Dispatch troops to collect lumber from a nearby forest and have them pick off a few barbarian clans along the way. Forces can also be split up between multiple commanders so that you can engage in multiple actions simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAlliance System\r\nFull set of alliance features allow players to help one another: alliance chat with built-in translation function, officer roles, map indicators to coordinate strategies, and more! Alliances can expand their territory to gain resources, capture mountain passes and barbarian outposts to strengthen their position, and work together to unlock group achievements.\r\n\r\nConquer the Kingdom\r\nFight alongside your alliance to take control of this vast kingdom. Clash with other players and use superior tactics to emerge victorious in a MMO strategy battle royale. Rise to the top and you and your civilization will be written down in your kingdom’s history!\r\n\r\nRPG Commanders\r\nCall upon dozens of historical figures who will serve as your trustworthy commanders, from Julius Caesar and Sun Tzu to Joan of Arc and Kusunoki Masashige.

Or dedicate yourself to helping your own people?<br> <br>Only time will tell...<br> <br><b>**Features**</b><br><br><b>Real-Time Battles</b><br>Battles are not pre-calculated but happen in real time on the map. Anyone can join or leave a battle at any time, allowing true RTS gameplay. See an ally being attacked right in your backyard? Send some troops to help your buddy out, or launch a surprise counterattack on the attacker’s city. <br><br><b>Seamless World Map</b><br>All in-game action takes place on a single, enormous map inhabited by players and NPC characters. No isolated bases or separate battle screens. Never before seen on mobile “infinite zoom” feature allows you to transition freely between the world view and individual cities or barbarian outposts. Map features include natural obstructions such as rivers and mountain ranges and strategic passes that must be captured to gain entrance to neighboring regions.<br><br><b>Eleven Unique Civilizations</b><br>Choose one of 11 historical civilizations (more to come!) and guide your civilization from a lone clan into a great power. Each civilization has its own architecture, unique units, and special advantages.<br><br><b>Exploration &amp; Investigation</b><br>The world of Rise of Kingdoms is covered in thick fog.

Investigate lost temples, barbarian fortresses, mysterious caves, and tribal villages, gather intelligence on your enemies, and prepare yourself for the ultimate clash! <br><br><b>Unrestricted Troop Movements</b><br>New orders can be issued to troops at any time, offering limitless strategic possibilities. Launch a feint at an enemy city, then circle back and meet up with your alliance army to capture a pass. Dispatch troops to collect lumber from a nearby forest and have them pick off a few barbarian clans along the way. Forces can also be split up between multiple commanders so that you can engage in multiple actions simultaneously.<br><br><b>Alliance System</b><br>Full set of alliance features allow players to help one another: alliance chat with built-in translation function, officer roles, map indicators to coordinate strategies, and more!

            "Great game, lots of fun. Just like Game of war, mobile strike, and all the other games like this though. Fully pay to win. People spend hundreds of dollars a day and then a handful of whales makes all the kingdom rules and do whatever they want. You can spend thousands of dollars and then wait a month or 2 and be obsolete. Unless you can afford dropping 10-20k in the next year, find another game. F2p will dump thousands of hours into this game only to be dominated and crushed by bullies.",
            "Leave this one alone. 2 years into game. Most expensive game ever. It's just to expensive. Ive put a few 1000 $$$$. In the last month alone around $800 into this game and cannot compete. The developers are money gouging. The game has no enjoyment any more. If you do not spend big you will not thrive. And the cost of healing troops is phenomenal. Do not attack or let others attack you, it will send you broke. Dominated by Asian players.",
            "Decided to download after seeing hundreds of this game's ads, and instantly became addicted. This game is easy to pick up and hard to put down because of the fact that, unlike similar titles like Clash of Clans, this game constantly gives you a feeling of accomplishment and progress through everything you do. Rarely is progress slow either, it's a steady climb of power from the moment you start. Also, people in alliances ACTUALLY help eachother grow and everyone can contribute. 10/10.",
            "I love this game. Much more involved as far as team work goes. That's what I like most. THAT, was two years ago. Now whales have taken the game. If you are not willing to spend time (like 2years) playing mostly if not free. Then stay away! There are actual people here who have spent over 10k USD just to be huge. You don't own the game. They can pull the plug any time they choose. And you gain nothing. I am quitting after playing a loyal and honest game. Those qualities will get you nowhere.",
            "The game is good but some little things can be added to make it better. Also alliance members should be allowed an option to give arrows of resistance. it takes to long to get to the last age. And it should be easier to get legendary commanders like Richard the 1st. They need to work more on the game. It should not take 1 year to get to 10 million power, this game out last your device. It should only take 2 months to get to 5 mill not 9 months. Also your verification system is very annoying. 👍"

Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",

            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "I have been looking for a game of this callier for ages and the bem i found it. Classic ages of kings, kingdom building fantasy, online multiplayer, strategic, simulation. Well am nkt so happy with the simulation but what the hell, this is the best online stategic war game out there and millions are playing it. You will meet person. Download it, regret latter. Or not.",
            "Its safe to say top player status is reserved for people with too much $. Get in where you fit in and play with the wealthiest and most active alliance in kingdom. Game requires A LOT of time to progress, but new features make it easy to grow. Dont make purchases into new stuff right away. all the too frequent release of new things are usually modified in some way shortly. no solo stuff, must team rally. If you dont plan to spend over $30k, focus style on things that let you benefit rally join",
            "Good experience, but now it put me in a bad situation. Once i logged in my gf castle, she became able to read my conversation with everyone through her castle, now our relationship is going towards break up. Because of your unsafe chats. I also have my farms chats in my main castle. Correct this thing and save others. 😪",
            "Cok did well fixing some bugs, but we still need more explanations about how the system of attributes works, and how does it affects the results of the battles, we need simple explanation please. Plus adds when you open the game, I was about to be zeroed because of that. We already see your offers, there is no need to keep showing us that everytime we open the game.",
            "It's a good game but it takes time to grow without paying. With the chinese bot accounts controlling everything it's hard to stay motivated. Honestly I do prefer all the in game purchases over the ads though and it's not so bad cause the game is actually a bit of fun."

            "Game has good graphics and good variety of slot games to choose from. The positives end there. Odds are worse than casinos. After the initial lump sum you start with, the game does not provide enough free credits for gameplay. I wait an entire day, collect my rewards, and I'm only able to play for 15-30 seconds on minimum bet. They are trying to make this app a cash-cow via pay-to-play. Would not recommend to anybody.",
            "LOL...Gave up on this game a long time ago because it was way too hard to win. It takes so long to click though the crazy number of popups just get to play. Upate.... Decided to give it another try. It's hilarious how much they let you win in the beginning and then ask for a rating. It eventually becomes impossible to win. The publisher standard response is it pays like real Vegas slots. NOT EVEN CLOSE!",
            "A big wast of time unless you want to be buying points all the time just to play. Played the walking dead game, took over 5 million points at 30000 a as pin to finally get the free games, then it was a waste didn't win much for what it takes to get there in the first place. This is one of my favorite games and you took all the fun out of it, along with the extras. Verry disappointed",
            "I've been playing this game for a while now. It's the best one I found so far yes the graphics are awesome. You can't expect to win all the time therefore you got your time's where it does hit and then you got your times it doesn't hit that's at any normal Casino. If you expect to win all the time Where is the challenge? What I found is if one game is not hitting go to another game, there is aways a game hitting. I have no problem keeping coins in my bank.",
            "Great trainer for the real thing made by the maker of your favorite games. I win more in Vegas so not sure they are lifelike. I think there should be more playback. But the graphics are killer and sounds are just like the real machines in Vegas. My favourite is Buffalo Gold and other variations of the Buffalo game."

            "This is the absolute best slots game, that I have ever played. The graphics, in the games are unique and the wins play better than all so far. I find myself playing for hours when I have the coins to do so. When you win a large jackpot it makes it harder to put down. Still playing for hour's on my favorite game. I recently deleted 4 other games, because they don't compare.",
            "Fun and addictive. But you run out of free coins really fast!!! It would be nice if they would offer more ways to earn them. Once you run out of free spins, which is REALLY fast, you have to buy coins to play!!! It sux!!! And if you're like me, you know that to win more you HAVE to do a MAX BET!!! That is where they get you!!! You use up all of your free spins this way!! THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE SPINS!!! DONT GET SUCKED IN LIKE I DID!!! IT ISN'T WORTH IT!!!!",
            "Played for months, spent probably around $1,000 on packages...having fun. I understand it is a play-to-win game and so I had no problem making the occasional purchase - but recently their greed has just gotten to be too much. The way the game is programmed to purposely work against you to force more purchases has taken any fun or sense of the excitement out of the game. They aren't even coy about it; it's just blatant and irritating. I won't be spending another penny on any Playtika games.",
            "Here we go again with the app doing more cool features which causes loading issues that go on for months. Always the same advice to uninstall and reinstall which does nothing. It seems this always happens close to tournaments ending so you can't reach the grand prize. Also too many contests going on at the same time, so you are being forced to play. Just what are these \"cool features?\"",
            "Everything in this online casino is about trying to get you to spend money on air. Everytime you switch games you have to navigate through 6 ads begging for money. Enough is enough. One ad is ok two is tollerable but so many ads begging for money is insane. If I was to spend money at an online casino it would be one where I have a chance to win real money. Sorry ceasers but your online casino is well below par in my view."

        "comments": [
            "I previously played when it was tied to Facebook. It was a good game then, but now it's a whole different game. The alliances, dragon rescue, etc. is fun. What ain't fun is the sheer number of dragons behind a pay wall (I stopped playing at the point they added legendary dragons), the amount pop ups before you can actually play the game with no way to skip all, having to click the \"feed\" button a hundred times, adds that come out of nowhere. There are a few more issues, but that's the majority.",
            "Love the game, but I hate that global chat was removed, we have chest cool downs, and I'm bombarded with ads. I used to watch ads for rewards, but these Yahoo ads are killin me. Now I'm even getting ads when I do basic things during the game, not choosing to watch the ad. Yahoo ads are annoying since I have to wait at least 50 seconds as well as periodically tap in order to finish the ad, but it was optional (watch ads for rewards). The game seems like it's dying out now..",
            "Right out the gate if you spend $30 and put it in the right area this game will be your favorite game. I truly feel that this game can be a game of the century but I don't like how everything costs so much money. if you're not careful you will nickel and dime yourself. It is an extremely fun and addictive game though and I wish they had it for console. There's a ton of variety a lot of different combinations of dragons mini games mini worlds and everything in between. Excellent game.",
            "So I love this game. I have since I was young. There are only one things I would like to address. The amount of ads u get when you first get on the game, maybe incorporate them into the game some way, but my whole family plays this also and hates the ads. Now I would like to suggest an idea. Therr should be a way to send gifts to your friends every day. Just one a day. And when u keep sending then it can increase ur friendship level and increase your rewards in ur gifts, ex. A dragon. Thank you!",
            "Love the game but as of the 4th of October, Australia started daylight savings and we accepted the fact that the event currency collection times moved from 4am, 12pm and 8pm (all EST), to 5am, 1pm and 9pm. It was an hour later, but we understood. However, recently for some reason, again the event currency collection times have shifted another hour later to, 6am, 2pm and 10pm. We are not enjoying this change and it is restricting us from getting the most out of the game. I hope it can be fixed."

This means more chairs, more food, and even an extra corner for kids!<br>*The entire yard has been re-designed and it now includes a sand box, benches, and many more!<br>*And before we forget, we have new pets!",

            "I loved my town able to have any character with no ads or unlocks which was money and same for the clothing and other items, but now most of the games cost money and not free almost every single character and clothing cost money or ads, and if their showing a little bit of skin it will give them a tank top which I find dumb, and it resets my progress so I have to rewatch ads, I really hope this is fixed for most of the games because I really like these games when I was young, thank you if you do",
            "What! Is this true I just thought it was best friends house OMG it's really like my town best friends house thank u my town for doing this amazing update and a small suggestion if u are giving games free then do some updates in that too (like renovating them) so that u will get more players u are marvelous!!",
            "I love your game, but what I see in this game my brother and sister got a car to go anywhere. But why I doesn't got the same. For the first time I buy this I really love it, but now not again..... So please fix this. And on the picture when I open the game I see my picture doesn't same like my brother and my sister too!!! Mine is wearing mask but my sister and brother not!!!!! Please fix this!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😤😤",
            "I like this game but the reason behind I gave it 4 stars is that there are too......... Much adds in it . It is my favourite game . You also should also bring all the clothes you had in the closets . Only some clothes are free . If you don't mind, please make the app as it was , please . I like the old version more than this one . And please also free up all the characters. ( In all your games ) ."

I'm listening to my audiobook and have been tapping for 20 minutes and still there is no option to turn off the sound. It's also incredibly dumb that you can't tap tap and upgrade at the same time, and there is no \"buy max\" button. This tutorial is going on forever, I hate being railroaded by a game Edit: apparently the railroading never stops. Uninstalling",

Had daily reward and went to watch ad to exchange only to get no reward at all",

Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",

If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

        "description": "Fix your credit with Lexington Law Firm.\r\n\r\nThe Lexington Law app lets you follow your credit repair progress. With access to a variety of tools, you can better understand, improve and protect your credit, from your mobile device.\r\nLexington Law is an advocate for you, the consumer. We want to make sure your credit is reported fairly and accurately. If you’ve been denied for credit, then let us help you get back on the path to approval.\r\n\r\nCredit Repair Services\r\n\r\nUnlike other credit repair companies, we obtain your credit reports from all three credit bureaus - Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Then we work with you to establish challenge reasons for each negative item on your report. We send electronic disputes to the bureaus on your behalf and also communicate directly with your creditors.\r\n\r\nWe're absolutely confident in our proven credit repair process. We've helped successfully remove over 10 million inaccurate, unfair or unsubstantiated negative items from credit reports in 2017 alone. On average our clients see 10.2 negative items or 24% of their presenting negatives, removed within the first 4 months of service.\r\n\r\nNote: As all legal cases are different these results should not be expected and are not guaranteed.\r\n\r\nFICO® Score\r\n\r\nMany of our service levels include a TransUnion FICO® Score to help you keep track of your credit progress. FICO® Scores are involved in 90% of US based lending decisions.\r\n\r\nFocus Tracks\r\n\r\nOur credit repair services don’t simply dispute every negative item on your credit report like some other companies. Rather we use your input and life experiences to determine how to challenge each negative item. We leverage several laws and consumer protections based on your feedback to achieve results. There are many protections for consumers who’ve gone through a life event that may have affected their credit such as divorce, identity theft, military service, medical bills and mishandled student loans. If you’ve gone through one of these life events then our service is for you.\r\n\r\nCredit Reports\r\n\r\nWhen you sign up with our service, we pull your credit reports for all three credit bureaus. We aggregate your credit report items and present them in an easy to understand interface. Your credit report information is then used to dispute and intervene with the credit bureaus and your creditors.\r\n\r\nCredit Monitoring\r\n\r\nWe monitor your credit using a set of credit monitoring alerts called ReportWatch. Our monitoring services not only alert you when something changes on your TransUnion credit report but also gives you information and advice based on the change.\r\n\r\nIdentity Theft Protection\r\n\r\nLexington Law provides identity theft insurance up to $1MM. In addition, a few of our service levels include a thorough set of identity protection alerts and monitoring services that rival LifeLock.\r\n\r\nDigital Money Manager\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing services to fix your credit, we provide tools to help manage your financial life.

With access to a variety of tools, you can better understand, improve and protect your credit, from your mobile device.<br>Lexington Law is an advocate for you, the consumer. We want to make sure your credit is reported fairly and accurately. If you’ve been denied for credit, then let us help you get back on the path to approval.<br><br>Credit Repair Services<br><br>Unlike other credit repair companies, we obtain your credit reports from all three credit bureaus - Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Then we work with you to establish challenge reasons for each negative item on your report. We send electronic disputes to the bureaus on your behalf and also communicate directly with your creditors.<br><br>We&#39;re absolutely confident in our proven credit repair process. We&#39;ve helped successfully remove over 10 million inaccurate, unfair or unsubstantiated negative items from credit reports in 2017 alone. On average our clients see 10.2 negative items or 24% of their presenting negatives, removed within the first 4 months of service.<br><br>Note: As all legal cases are different these results should not be expected and are not guaranteed.<br><br>FICO® Score<br><br>Many of our service levels include a TransUnion FICO® Score to help you keep track of your credit progress. FICO® Scores are involved in 90% of US based lending decisions.<br><br>Focus Tracks<br><br>Our credit repair services don’t simply dispute every negative item on your credit report like some other companies. Rather we use your input and life experiences to determine how to challenge each negative item. We leverage several laws and consumer protections based on your feedback to achieve results. There are many protections for consumers who’ve gone through a life event that may have affected their credit such as divorce, identity theft, military service, medical bills and mishandled student loans. If you’ve gone through one of these life events then our service is for you.<br><br>Credit Reports<br><br>When you sign up with our service, we pull your credit reports for all three credit bureaus. We aggregate your credit report items and present them in an easy to understand interface. Your credit report information is then used to dispute and intervene with the credit bureaus and your creditors.<br><br>Credit Monitoring<br><br>We monitor your credit using a set of credit monitoring alerts called ReportWatch. Our monitoring services not only alert you when something changes on your TransUnion credit report but also gives you information and advice based on the change.<br><br>Identity Theft Protection<br><br>Lexington Law provides identity theft insurance up to $1MM. In addition, a few of our service levels include a thorough set of identity protection alerts and monitoring services that rival LifeLock.<br><br>Digital Money Manager<br><br>In addition to providing services to fix your credit, we provide tools to help manage your financial life. Similar to Mint, our digital money manager tracks your income, spending, transactions, budgets, trends, debts and net worth.<br><br>About Lexington Law<br><br>A trusted leader in credit repair for over a decade, Lexington Law, we help you understand your rights as a consumer in the credit space, and help you leverage those rights to ensure that you have a fair, accurate, and fully substantiated credit report.

Otherwise no issues with timely loading, or updated info and definitely NO issues with the support teams efforts and quick responsevtime. The team and the rest of the material is greatly set up to my expectations.",
            "I love this app! Not only is it helping me pay off my debts, it helps me keep track of what's being paid off, how much I have left on my debt, how many issues have been resolved & how many I have left to resolve. Plus it keeps me updated on my credit score. I love LOVE it",
            "Trans union hasn't worked for over a year now. I've called about it at least 8 times and they said it would be fixed but it hasn't been. I've spoken to multiple different associates since I've had it and nothing has been corrected.",
            "This is a wonderful out the simple reason that it doesn't stay logged in log in on my phone means that it's totally in line with what I need to be doing to keep furthering the investigating of my identity and the data breaches that have happened around me without my permission",
            "I am very happy with the work they have put in to help me repair my credit. I had problems with even looking at my own credit score until they started removing things over my credit I did not do myself. It does take time for them to remove things off your credit so it might seem like your wasting your money at first but you will start seening results."

I found this app to be interesting with great graphics, but to only to have a introduction of how to use the controls one time and only one time. I will not keep this app.",
            "Great game , beutiful graphics, unfortunately it's got so many bugs it's almost one of the worst gaming experience I've had, I loved the game even with many problems, but twice now game shuts down when I'm about to receive my tournament rewards, now I can no longer go to the tournament mode because the game instantly shuts down, to make things worse the developers havnt replied to my over ten reports on their crispy game, I'm not even sure there is anyone there who even cares.",
            "This game really captures the jousting experience and what it's like to be a knight & jouster. This is really a super fun and great game I love it, ever since i got this game I've been having so much fun with it I wish that there was the sword arena because that was a big part of the whole jousting competitions or carnivals whatever the hell they were called but other than that this is a really great game I can sit & play this game for hours or until I run out of patence of nobility.",
            "It's sad to see this game die, it is so unique theres not a single game like it. It didnt even bother me that you had to wait for seals. Played for maybe 2 weeks before it stopped working. Cant even open the app. Money well wasted. If you're going to make a game do your community a favor and stick with it. Be dedicated to it. You have let so many people down.",
            "Great game that's easy to pick up and play, had it across multiple device and managed to keep my account each time, very easy to lose track of time playing this game, not so keen on the gem cost of a few items but if your willing to save and grind it's not so bad overall I'd give it a 4.5"

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "My printer does not work now since the recent update. Before it use to work. Now it says it's offline and my whole printer does not work all together. Been turning it off and restarting it and still does not connect. It says it's offline. So I don't know what happen since the recent update on the app. Please fix it or is it something else with my printer. I have network and wifi is good. So is it the app?",
            "Even after the latest update, most features, including the all-important scan from printer, are now unavailable, rendering my expensive printer worthless. It tries to connect me with HP Web Services (which past versions never required), which then gets me an \"invalid request\" error every time. Awful, awful, awful app. Nonexistent support from HP. Avoid!",
            "Terrible. Absolutely awful. It worked for a while and now I can't connect my device to the printer because it claims I am not on the same network or something. HP falls right in line with every other technological service provider in providing unreliable service that does not function when needed and makes it impossible to get anything done. One more thing. Since app wasn't working I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now it won't connect to the printer even though its on and connected.",
            "Rendered useless come on HP what have you done to the app. It no longer is working and I need so much done doe work. This is so inconvenient especially working at home with no other access. This printer was bought to be used. Please fix the. There weew no notification sent to inform of the upgrade and any support to help with it..im so angry",
            "Same here. It was working great then I tried to print a recipe from my phone the other day and it won't work. I have checked settings, passwords, IP addresses. It shows it is there but it can't find it. I have disconnected, unplugged and am just over the whole frigging mess."

            "This game so good but the only thing I don't like in this game is bedwars cause the armour looks weird and the swords as well . But apart from that it is a good game and people target people so much our bed gets destroyed in seconds and it's not fair cause we don't have time to defend the bed cause people have already been broke our beds. My favoroute game on their is skyblock bedcause u can involve it to get bigger and u can do alot more on one game its. I have played now for 2 yrs now lol",
            "It's great! But I have a bit of a problem, when I play with friends, I start the game but it just keeps loading on my screen, and would not start for me but my friends could. Another problem I experienced is that when I chat, all I type is capitals letters. It's great though, nobody minds about that. And would really recommend to play this game with your friends.",
            "okay, Hii this is a fun app but I really hope they would make it more fun then it is and update all the other Games In BlockManGo, but I really in joy the game, I made friends actually a lot but I made real friends, if you're reading this review say a yes or a no I hope you agree with me some way or so and I'll see you BlockManGo. ▼・ᴥ・▼",
            "This is a really nice game I always play it because it's soo fun but there is a bug or glitch for games I can't play skyblock and one more thing they should lower the price for there clothing because it way too expensive I think it would be better if u add new shirts that is not that expensive so everyone can't use same clothing always hope this helps",
            "Yah i like the game but please add some graphics quality (low, medium,high). I play this game over yrs and there are some changes like the gcubes(gold cubes) are added in the game and the bcubes(blue cubes) are now like trash. Bedwars is a pretty good game but its not fair when other players have op swords its just like pay to win"

            "It's honestly addictive once you get the hang of it, which doesn't take long! And so far it's easy to level up and progress in the game unlike other games like this. Also literally no ads, unless you choose to watch an ad to speed up the already fast tasks! So I have nothing bad to say about it! Nice job Pewds!",
            "This is from when i first played it. It is great and fun and i love it, but had to uninstall it bcs of problems with my storage. Now that i fixed my storage i reinstalled it but to my suprise i cant play. Im stuck im the loading screen where it has the logo of the game and the colorful background. If u can help me plz do",
            "This game is actually very well made. The way they inserted mini games to keep you interested while you wait or if you wanna do something different. And the best part is its not the \"pay to win\" kind of mobile game with all the pop-up ads on top of it. You can just grind your way to the top or you can take the easier way around if you have money to spend. Absolutely love this game. No wonder it's still relevant 😁😉",
            "Ive had this app for 3 years now and let me just say: phoenomenal. You'd really think it would get boring after playing for awhile, but there are mechanisms set in place that make it just alot of fun. I absolutely recomend to anyone who wants to have a good time. The pixel art is also just incredible!",
            "I used to love this game, but I call it bs now because it crashes too often or worse, it makes my phone too lagged that it forces me to hard reset my phone most of the time I attempt to log in to this game. I've been experiencing the same problem since February(as far as I can remember) but still, there's no improvement at all. It is so frustrating that I can play call of duty on my phone smoothly, but not tuber when supposedly, it is COD thay requires a better phone specs so WHY?!!!!"

I would've given you a five but the bonuses are small and that's what draws me to a game. Hi I'm back and starting over my pad had a melt down so I had to clear it. I have some favorite games now but I still find it strange that the bonus`s are so small and at times you get nothing from the free spins. So bonuses are a waste of time.",

Lucky to have such a great game. I play every day. Hard to stop. Incredible. Excellent. Fun. wonderful. Fun. FUN. Swell. T",
            "Fun game but glitchy. More often than not, when I attempt to access the \"Winner's Club\" screen, I'm greeted with the message, \"Sorry. There is a temporary issue with Winner's Club. Please try later.\" When that message is the norm, \"temporary\" is a misnomer. This issue has persisted over several updats, hence my reason for deducting two stars (playing over wi-fi with a strong signal and a fast connection)",
            "I've been playing DUC for several years. So addicting! I do have a couple of suggestions: A \"Collect and Send All\" button for gifts. It takes forever to collect gifts each day. It would be helpful if you could tap one button to collect all gifts and also return gifts that were sent to you. An \"Accept All\" button for friend requests. Would be another time saver...could spend more time playing the slots.",
            "I'm just wondering why the old downtown slot has been removed. There has been several new slots added but for the older slots like the old downtown slot game there hasn't been any new ones added like those types for a long time. I like that game and was very disappointed to it see it gone last night. Why was it taken down and will it be put back up, if not I may just remove this app and find another one. Very disappointed 🤔 so for now I am dropping the five star rating to three stars."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "I am learning to play the guitar and so I need an app like this to help me record backing drum tracks for my practicing. I like the fact that you can see the parts and PLAY THEM and actually listen to the different sounds of the drum set...GREAT. What the app does not offer me, is the chance to place those sounds in a certain order, combine sounds and record the sequence and actually be able to use it as a backing track for your guitar learning. As it is, I see no practical use for it.",
            "I like the overall sound and smooth running of the app. I think it could be much better if you added more features such as being able to move around the pieces to arrange the kit in a way I like, an option to lock the bass drum with a cymbal so every time I hit the cymbal it also hits the bass drum automatically, add a choke to the cymbal, maybe individually adjust each kit piece's volume, and perhaps more options for different sounds (maybe a china, a third crash, a different ride/bell).",
            "I gave it 4 stars because of the delay I'm expiriencing on my tablet. It is fine on my phone and works well but I think it's cause I have an older version on it. I just got my tablet so I'm guessing I have the newest version of it. Please fix the delay and I'll rewrite this with a 5 star rating. The app deserves a 10 star rating when it's working well. It really is a great app. Just that one little🤏 prob. I have faith that it'll bs fixed. Thank you 🙂"

            "It's an really enjoyable game but I wish there were a couple of changes. One off those changes is that they added a gear lever or an option in the setting to have one. This is one when your breaking and coming to a stop you don't end up driving backwards. The other change this game could have is to be able to turn the person faster instead of having to swipe on the screen multiple times just to turn around. Other than that I love this game",
            "Yes, I know it is in beta but it is very buggy. I get stuck in the ground, the car camera glitches out and that is only SOME of the experiences I've had. The Demon is WAYYYYY too drifty. Please try to fix these issues by the next upcoming updates. I will rate 3 stars (for now.)",
            "This is very cool and addicting car driving game but please make an option for adjusting and customizing game control button's size and position. Then I will give this review 5 stars. It is very hard to turn the vehicle on steering wheel option due to its smaller size. And please add vehicle customisation like vinyls, paint jobs, spoilers, lips, skirts etc (to make the car looks cool and unique from other players).",
            "The game is detailed good, atleast it's the first time I've experienced such detailed car simulater game. Also it's quests are easy and interesting. Graphics are also great. But there's a bit problem in it. We can only get out of the car in first-person view. I'd like it if you give a button to exit the car in. Third person view(back of car view). Some of the games effects are derived from NFS Most Wanted, I noticed that. But overall I loved this game. Also it's offline.",
            "It is a good game , but I think there should be cars like Toyota fortuner, innova and rolls royce. There should taxi in which we will also be able to hire and there should be more mafia missions , this are the things that I would recommend you to add at the next update. But this game is a really good game. please add the( rolls royce phantom model) add this rolls royce car because this car would make the game more interesting.please add this car by the next update , and the game is interesting"

I understand trying to keep the game updated and fresh; but to screw over existing players is not cool. And though I use Wi-Fi, I find it takes forever to get in and at times find myself getting stuck when it's uploading to the next game play.",
            "The game has never been so laggy, it stutters and freeze like never before. There are invisible players spawnkilling everyone, and there's a really annoying bug on the first spawn of every match; I always have to wait for someone to kill me so I can spawn and go help my team. And now, the Sniper Scopes (6x and 8x) shakes way too much, making it impossible for snipers to stabilize their aim right on the target without getting too vulnerable, please, fix this.",
            "Its so GD laggy, before update 6.0 the gameplay network connection flow was almost seamless but now players are shooting me behind GD fuxking walls because hotboxes and whereas my character actually is are delayed and nowhere near in smooth synchronization between the two...please address this network connectivity issue as it makes this and or any game absolutely dreadfully painful to enjoyably play! I've spent so many hours and so much money in support of the development because I've faith...",
            "The newest update brings pay to win significantly, added profile picture fixed stuck on prime choice and its good The bad: is my time to render the game is now very slow my character hasnt rendered completely and it decreases framrate it will he covered when u play the match for a while -Stuck on uncancelable matchmaking -cant start the match making only showed pls wait and it happend contiously as long as i press the \"battle\" botton to start the game",
            "Since the new update came out it's been taking about 10 mins to search for rooms and then 10 more mins to actually start playing; when it finally loads the match is already half way done. Its unfair how these apps for free users theres no care for them at all unless you spending money. I need this issue resolved with the taking forever to load and search for rooms."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

Stopped working and never resumed. Customer support takes days to figure out anything. Sent me the wrong message about Kaspersky kid troubleshooting. Stear clear from this service, especially if you are in China.",

So many times I've noticed that it's off and I get to play the \"how long has my data been un secured\" game. Definitely won't be renewing my subscription as this app isn't trustworthy. Such a shame, as I've been using Kaspersky for years.",
            "I've been using this app for a while with no problems on my S9 Plus, recently I updated to the Note 20 and it's not working on the Note 20 but still working on the S9 Plus. It says it has connected to said location but I still cannot access blocked content from the country I am in using my Note 20. Please fix this problem.",
            "If you are paying for only getting this service on Android phones, don't waste your money. It only works on Windows and Android app is useless as it always fail to connect. For a whole year of subscription , it worked for few days on Android no matter what the device I use. They would reply that service is blocked in country while it works well on Windows all the time. Inexperienced support on mobile platform indeed.",
            "Edit: already fix it, thank you.. First the app was working good and then (don't know when) the app fail to connect, try to restart my device but failed, then try reinstall but failed connect my subscription account, please fix it. Note: my another device just fine using it,"

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

            "First of all, there are just so many damn ads. You have to see a whole lot of em. Like you get an ad after every match. Secondly, there is certain network issues with some specific opponents only. I mean like it's all going good then suddenly an opponent and it gets network and they just win it, especially if you are playing a tournament. That's really frustrating.",
            "Yet another great game ruined by greed! To the Dev...you know those adverts that keep popping up? Nobody watches them, nobody clicks on them, nobody cares about them because they are irrelevant and so out of touch. Also, why are we limited to playing only 5-6 games before we have to pay money to refill? Absolute D**k move. So why don't you just make a €2.99 one off payment option and let us enjoy your god damn game!!! I'll even put money on the fact that you won't even respond to my review 🤫",
            "This game is such a pay-to-win! It comes up to three things: pay for diamonds, buy powerups, and win matches swiftly. You can be 5 scores ahead of another player and suddenly lose the match because your opponent uses their powrups to win the game in 20 seconds! You can even pay for bigger and faster characters! The game itself was so good if both players had equal abilities in every match.",
            "Greed has ruined the game, thanks developer. This game is actually fun and exciting but there are ads after every match. It's very annoying. If you love to watch ads every 1.5 minutes of game play, you need to have this game! There are countless of \"crazy special deals\" that you can purchase at \"up to 90% off\". Just so many ways that entice players to spend spend spend!",
            "The game is getting ridicules! I believe when one click search, the game should automatically put an opponent of the same level of power! Not a ridiculously super powered opponent who you don't stand a chance against! I'm not enjoying this game any more. This issue should be fixed. Here I am writing you new update. I thought you guys have take into consideration your the reviews of your users and fixed the issue which everyone is complaining about! You guys suck. big time."

We didn't know we were paying for broken junk. Fix it. 6/20 Playback still bugged. 6/1 Playback still bugged. Still hasn't responded to email. Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",
            "This App became USELESS. It was so good 2years ago, so easy to connect and view the cameras. Wth happened, since I did the update it seems the app has issues connecting. I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. 😡",
            "Was great at first. Now after 3 days of using it the notifcation have stopped. Ive when into app notifaction menu and set to urgent high priority and still nothing. I thought maybe no movement is being dected. So i check playback and sure enough its catching and recording movement but fails to notify me.",
            "The app will not load all my cameras and it's so glitchy. Great cameras and monitor but what's the point of having a app if you can't use it!! Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",
            "All of a sudden, getting no push notifications. When I try to check alerts, I get a message that says \"Failed to get alarm message\". I've checked the settings on my phone to make sure I can get the notifications and every thing is fine. Is this an update issue? Very irritating!"

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "Starting out giving the game five Stars. So far okay. We shall see. The graphics in the game are so so just okay not that great. It's like all the other Google app store games if you want to play you're going to have to pay. And you know what! I really don't mind paying a developer real money if the game is really good and really fair and no cheating and no game fixing. Unfortunately ! Most games on Google are letting alot of players cheat ! I hate losing to a p o s cheater .",
            "Good graphics, decent gameplay but....it's set up too make you lose. Fake bot players programmed to make you win in the beginning and then once you're hooked after a few wins, you start losing. That concept is called pay-to-play. As you lose, unsurprisingly, cue the ads to buy more in-game coin. I'm not naive, I know it's a model used by most games but here it's so obvious it dulls the game. There are better bowling games out there that at least allows you to enjoy the gameplay.",
            "Bowling King is very fun but you might ask why did I give it a four-star because you could accidentally Mash something and buy it but what is really cool like some other game you have to buy a lot but in this game you can watch an ad get diamond cash coins this app is really cool and I encourage you to get it it's totally free unless you want to buy chips hope you like it.",
            "This game has been acting up for the past month. The configuration is way off! First, it changed the color of my lane...just like that! Unable to change it back. Then you can't maneuver the ball correctly. If you aim the ball either to the left or right, that's an automatic gutter ball. Please fix whatever's going on!! I love this game and I would hate to delete it!",
            "What an exciting and enjoyable APP that is realistic and challenging. Thank you. It's always a pleasure using this bowling APP. I have tried other bowling apps and always come back to this one. Thank you for the GREAT entertainment. Back for more fun. Thank you!"

            "This game deserves a million stars out of five. The chance to visit another village is like visiting another planet. Mindblowing those villages are. That the game goes from night to day synchronized to the actual diurnal nocturnal quotidian circadian algorithm of natural time actually brought me to tears, in a good way. The spirit of the medieval forest is present in this smurfy app. Smurfeat emptor: October 30 2020. Paid $6.81 for lunar new year dragon and did not get it. App snapped off after.",
            "Played this game years ago and missed it, had to come back. Yes, there are glitches. Read up on how to manually save your game. The extra attention is worth it. The game is super cute, I found game support to be helpful when I had an issue. It's the only game I happily spend real money on, much to my husbands chagrin muaha! Love the development, the graphics, being able to create my village. Each day I look forward to opening up my village and working on it makes me smile.",
            "Super cute!! Look forward to playing with my favorite Smurfs everyday. Love the new updates and graphics. One issue I don't like is somethings are worth more money than the smurf huts, like how Fairy Prince Garth is normally worth $24.99. I don't think somethings will be worth the price we're paying. Other than that, the game is so worth playing or at least taking a look at.",
            "I wish i could do 0 stars. I had a huge village, including other locations like the grove etc. But It doesn't save anything after i last downloaded it. No new buildings, anything i place in a garden bed, it's just gone whenever i open the app again, even if it only been a few minutes.",
            "Excellent gameplay. You will not get bored if you play online or offline. Everytime more interesting things are coming...but for suggestion i just suggest that improve gameplay for story line and make more story thinkful and adventures."

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

            "This app does not work. I called AT&T three times and it still not working. Keep getting the same error message \" The system is currenrly unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Okay, I'm like level 22 now, it's a good game so props on that, only complaints I have are some of the islands aren't open yet, so idk how to fix the plane, I'm guessing that'll come with future updates, and for some reason there isn't a way to open the hangar on that science lab island, other than that, it's decent for a mobile game, plays pretty smoothly on my note 10+. good job guys",
            "Controls is terrible. The dev didn't even appreciate player palm and finger size. The virtual joy pad simply too close to corner, its ridiculous for my thumb length and palm size. Movements are wierd. The island visit is nice n fun though, but kinda stupid. When u r drifting on a raft in ocean, n found tiny island with intact houses, why even bother to go back to raft n keep drifting again😂🤣. It couldn't stop me from laughing.🤣😂🤣",
            "Edit: I have totally changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because of one very disturbing thing. The new update (12/10/2020) has made my game terrible, when you go on survival, there is no shop icon and the map icon you cannot press anymore. When I go on create, it just has survival section, so that is not right. Developers, please read this review and respond to it because this is a very important message to fix this situation. Thanks.",
            "Interesting but the opening screen does not play, so I select Skip. Game then plays. I have only played for a short time and the game seems to have a lot of potential. I have one problem so far. I keep hearing what sounds like the word HEAVY. Not sure what that means but it is driving me nuts. Does it mean I have too much stuff on the raft and need to increase the size of the raft? Please help as I would like to continue playing.",
            "There is no purpose to this game. I played this game all summer. I built a massive fortress. I collected and crafted THOUSANDS of items. I really wanted more. The new update is a failure. All the developers did was change textures (looks very bad now). No new missions. No new game play. All they did was shrink one island and open a new one. Why add so many unnecessary things? 7 pop up windows to start the game? Very disappointing."

I want to remove one star but, NO GO that I can see . No joy .",

It is Very annoying when it charge and with every percentage the batt charge their is a sound. The only sound that I want to hear is WHEN MY PHONE BATTERY IS FULLY CHARGE PLEASE",

Oh and most importantly remember that second to last these all chapters will take stars. You most have to colect them all. If you do'nt so you can't start a new chapter. Understand😕? Ooh I forget to tell you something🤔. Well at first chapter you will get some \"Secret Mission\" to do. You could by shadow bob. He's 50.",
            "Decent game, less levels than the original, but holds your attention better. I do wish it was easier to get more coins because I barely got to play with the store. 3 maxed out clothes, with only buying one with coins, the other two were the original one and the special one from doing secret missions. Only got 2000 coins after that without ever buying anything else, and getting 3 stars on ever level, and finishing all secrete missions. I'm not going to go back and repeat levels just to get coins.",

            "An awesome game to kill time! The only thing which is holding me back from giving this a 5 star rating is that there aren't many options to earn coins. I have completed the entire game + almost all the achievements and have only earned a mere 3550 coins while, simultaneously watched ads to double the coins. Now, the only option left to me is to replay the old stages, in order to buy/upgrade different costumes. I will definitely edit this review if a new way is added to counter this problem :)"

            "Overall, this is a good game. Balanced, progress isn't too slow, and fun. While it is a grind, frequent power ups and \"floating dollars\" make it easier, and I installed an auto clicker. I would rate it 4.5 stars, but that's not possible.",
            "Fun, ad optional , game to play Sometimes ads don't work or don't give buff, but sometimes it gives the ad buff, then gives it again, so when I giving my employee of the day more time, it became 32 hours But fun time waster Edit: BUT sometimes it says it going give you one thing from a flying gift, but then it doesn't give it to you, so when that's fixed, it will be a five star rating again",
            "This game is really good for using time when you have nothing to do and is generally a very fun game. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because, I was saving up 15 dollars (in game) to buy the coin rain and once I got the 15 needed it stopped me from buying it.",
            "This is a pretty good idle game. You can play it entirely without an internet connection and it doesn't shove microtransactions in your face every 5 seconds. I definitely recommend this game if you like idle games.",
            "I don't have all the badges in the game but it is pretty good not going to lie I got all the factories and I got to the millions of the Mondays and I got a couple robots I got like 18 and right now I got the trophy my first Trophy and recent at the game I'll see you later guys now time for me to work doing this"

            "This is a fun and addictive game. However, it's really buggy lately. Customer service is a crapshoot. When I got assigned David Jarryd, he only responded every 24 hours, didn't understand English and either only partly solved the problem or not at all. I made purchases that wouldn't include all of the items. Their response on here is to contact them on FB. I tried that, too. No response. I highly recommend that you avoid this game.",
            "I love it but sometimes lose the connection. But still the best game ever. I love the events please keep them coming would love events every day and maybe make available the chance to win more rolls some how as I always run out. Love playing with my friends and family but can we get more prizes and more options to add more friends and be rewarded for having over 30. Play every day and enjoy everytime so thank you developers for creating an exciting wonderful game x",
            "This game was good. Don't bother buying anything from the store as after you do the game doesnt let you land on good tiles ever! My friend and I are on the exact same board is board appears to work fine and actually allow him to make progress. All I get is rubbish. Fix the game you money hungry fake creators",
            "To be very honest, I really love the game and its addictive too. But I don't like when the level and dice counts increases, the time doesnt decreases because of this it makes less interactive to the game. As it seems the real problem what I'm facing till now. I think you must decrease the time because it makes people uninstall more early. I feel like that but I dint want to do that. I love the game. You should think of this problem.",
            "Overall it's a cute game to play whenever. But, I'm constantly get false notification. Like while im playing every few second, saying my dice cap is full or mini games is ending soon. Literally getting these while I'm actively playing. Im always getting kicked out. I have spent more on this game than I should, I feel like you don't get much for what your buying. Even though I have bought packs, I still haven't got my last card of my album. I've been trying to get the last card for over a month."

            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

Putting that aside, ads will randomly start playing and will play every time you exit the game. Overall, lack of updates, too many ads, and poor graphics, I do not recommend this game.",
            "So much ads but meh the ads that i see if it looks like a fun game i get it that why i like ads and gave this a five star 🌟 its such a fun game i had it when i was a kid and i am just now geting it so its so much fun i love this game and games like this are fun so keep up the good work and dont Lise to the people that say your gane is bad there just jealous that you guys have a good game and that they cant make a super special game like this its the best game ever. Thx for the good game. By.",

I absolutely love this game to making me 💯% calm and more much better relaxing while I'm stoned. 😵😵😵😜😂👌 Irishman41 😁👍🤑🤑🤑🙌🙌🙌",

            "Amazing!!! I'm a huge PSP fan. One of the best portable gaming devices ever created. It's nostalgia and great gaming on the go. Customize button layout, controller support. Fast forward speed button. The features are incredible, you can do more with PSP games that you could ever do with the actual real PSP console. SO MANY games available online. I've been missing out, glad I discovered the emulator/rom world. Mind blown! If this app would also support PS2 games as well , God status! 🙌",
            "It seems a decent app, overall, but I got it to play one particular game and it refuses to play that game. I have downloaded two different versions of the game, and I don't make it in 10 minutes before the app crashes. I have been through settings on the app too and turned down settings and whatever I need. When the game started I had a pop up about turning on frameskipper or whatever because the sound was choppy, but it hasn't helped. Very upsetting.",
            "I absolutely love this emulator. It was the very first emulator I have ever used and I was able to play through my favorite games time and time again. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to try and get into emulation 5/5. It's easy to understand how it works, roms aren't difficult to set up, and the controls are solid.",
            "Great app for playing psp games on Android. I have played a lot of games on it smoothly except the games that don't support the option 'skip buffer effects' resulting those games to be laggy. But overall it is one of the best emulators for Android. Thank you Henrik for making a great app. I never played psp games before,but now I can play them on my mobile. Please make a ps2 emulator for Android. I would love to use one if you make one",
            "Hello! I've sent a feedback. I hope you check it asap. The reason why I rate 3 stars because I was done extracting the chordromance file (Danganronpa) and once I extract from Zarchiver, I see the ISO file. Once I came back from moving the file to PSP games, I was ready to play my game that was extracted. When I play, the opening state was okay, but it the game keeps on stopping. Will you mind fixing this? Thank you."

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

            "I gave this game 3 stars! I love this game so much but... When I updated the game, all my dolls dissapered! I got really sad and angry. I wish I never updated the game. By the way I have some suggestions that you can add into the game: 1: When you update the game, you don't lose all yours dolls. 2: Add more outfits for the girls. 3: For the black eye color it should be darker. I love this game soo much. Thanks for making this game. I REALLY enjoy it!",
            "I love this game. It helps you be creative and choose who you want to create. People without premium get to have a challange were they get to use items that arent premium. I also love this game because it brought me closer to my friends that don't live near me and they end up installing the app. One thing i would like to add would be like hats or bows so you can have things in your hair without paying for premium. I hope this helps everyone that reads this. Thank you for making this game. 😊",
            "5/5 Stars!! I love this game so much! It's a great way to make avatars and you could even make your self and, try out different looks! There is minimal ads but, there could be a spin wheel that you can watch ads to spin and get like a daily spin to earn coins. You could then use those coins to unlock some of the locked items just for 1 or 2 uses. Mainly because some of the best items are locked and only for premium users. Other than that love this game and 10/10 recommend!!",
            "Very fun, adorable avatars, and I love the hairstyles and the fact you can layer the clothes, only one thing, this is just extra kind of feedback, maybe add a few more things, but overall it is amazing! Also it's not even that, that is the only thing I would say about improving this app! Super fun, and the fact you've included masks is another great feature, and shows your respect and seriousness towards the pandemic. Great job!",
            "This is a really great game. I personally think that you could add a new option for creating dolls (full body option) Aswell as this, you could also add some cool postitions for your doll to pose in, this way when you save your dolls they will be in a cool position and you can also see there legs aswell. Other than this, this is one of my favorite games to play. 👍🏻"

            "It's a wonderful time killing game, but once you get passed stage 45 the characters you are fighting will double in there health, power etc; when you and your opponent are on even power on all earlier stages. Then stage 45 comes and your opponent is on a power level of 2000 and you are still on power level 800, what are you supposed to do?...and even worse it stays at this unfair disadvantage (basically it needs a ranking system) (Otherwise your only choice is to rage or switch characters)",
            "The game itself is not so bad. Nothing too much to do but a decent time killer. The thing that bothers me is that ea so blatantly attempted this to be a cash grab for them. In-game transactions are not optional, they become more of a necessity. After a few rounds the opponents start coming so overpowerd that it literally becomes impossible to climb to their level without using real money. I am at level 219, my health is 9000 and the opponent i am fighting has a health of 65k. Really ea?",
            "Sad. More EA sadness. Can't move yourself around with a left toggle, it pushes you in automatically. You just spam punch in hopes it lands, randomly tapping an icon on the left side of the screen where you should be able to move, for special attacks...ground and pound is quickest to accumulate abilities on takedowns/grapples. Really its not a good experience at all, for a fighting style about \"control.\" If i wanted to play a tap \"boxing\" game, id play that AND be able to control my character.",
            "Overall, this game is pretty alright. But it gets mundane pretty early on. Graphics aren't that great either. An obvious money grabber from EA. Watch UFC and play the latest games on console, this one just isn't it. Hoping for another developer to come along and revolutionize this franchise, but until then, stay on consoles :)",
            "Could be better if the computer followed the same set of rules as the player, player can NEVER punch the computer fighter out of a special move but the computer can ALWAYS simply punch the player to completely stop any special move, computer can use body hook to stop take down, player cannot, also it is physically impossible to knock someone out by kicking them in the shin"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

I recommend this game for you, but if you can improve the movement of the characters: the way they dodge and throw a punch and allow us to make a combination like throwing two jabs and then uppercut. Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",
            "Best game ever, really entertaining.... Just add more items to the customize hub maybe add more tattoos and more hairstyles and an option to type your name on gloves😁and make the characters movements more realistic like dodging and the way they throw a punch.. Thank you developers for this great game🤩🤩🤩",

Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed 😞",

If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# 😱 Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! 😀 By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that!

You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",

            "Fun game. I mean, it is a stick figure shooting game, fend off the coming waves and move to next level. Unlimited lives so if you have food (you need food to play), you can play. As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",
            "Looks amazing at the beginning.. but as you advance the game looks more bias towards us... Very Poor. As I advanced further in the levels.. I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",
            "Here's the problem. 1)The loading between campain or character choice are far take Long to load. 2)Sometimes the arrow weapon or thrower weapon didn't hit the target even if it touch it,it just pass pass through the enemy. 3)After we die we can't use gems to revive ourself instead it came after 4 or 5 time we die in the campain or endless mode.4).Sometimes when we craft some javelin the damage decrease how? It cost 4000 to craft and the lvl and damage decrease.THE GAME IS FUN AND SPENT OUR DAY",
            "Pretty fun. One of the better phone games I've played. Not perfect from a fair, competitive standpoint, but that's not what they're trying to be. Kinda stupid for them to limit how much you can play the game with the \"supplies\" system, but whatever; it's their business."

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",

I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",

It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",

            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",
            "App wont open, keep getting notifications saying the app is updating...been doing this for 3 days..why is it updating for 3 days....not able to use it at all. This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",
            "This app is terrible. Att Smart Limits was a much better app. Each time I unpause my sons internet access, he has to restart his phone for it allow him internet. Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",
            "Slows down tablets and crashes constantly. So much lagg and crashes it starting to get old fast. About to uninstall this game after 3 days of trying to play."

The rewards for events suck, everything is expensive, Scopely HATES giving away free stuff, the prizes are always the minimum amount awarded, and often what you DON'T need. I started when it was new and rewarded well, now it's an exercise in disappointment. Unless you're a fan, don't bother, even then be cautious. 😡",
            "If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I've been playing for a few years now so, im invested. But, if you're reading this and you havent installed yet...dont. Scopely took a very entertaining game and turned into a giant cash grab. Unless you're prepared to open up your wallet and just give them everything in it you have 0 chance to be even competitive anymore. Screw getting ahead unless you fork over hundreds of $ forget about even seeing the same level as the average player.",
            "STAY AWAY!!!! unless you enjoy being screwed over time and time again, then go ahead and download and play it. Been playing pretty much since the game launched, there are toooo many bugs that they refuse to fix, they will rollback rewards as they see fit, most events will launch with issues and be taken down to be \"investigated\".... just not worth it",
            "The overall user experience is a nightmare. While there are some fun aspects to the game in terms of roster building and movesets, nothing comes close to the way the player is treated like absolute garbage by this company. On a weekly if not daily basis, there are messed up rewards that are shrugged off with the poorest possible apology and no recompense. If you are thinking about trying this game, don't.",
            "Good game... if you are one who needs to be the best on free cellphone games you're going to spend... key word (free) just keep it simple and enjoy. If you want to make developers rich then spend. It's a choice, they are not holding you hostage. That goes for any free cellphone game people download and complain about spending.

I sent a report to you guys and never got a response. I would give 0 stars. Horrible non-existent customer service",

There are a load of similiar fantastic games out there who are keeping their players engaged. This is not one of them."

Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "The game is really good but I have some problems. 1. There are limited locations to drive and if you attempt to cross the bridge you crash in the lock sign lol. 2. When you make all that money and have bought all the cars there are nothing more to do with the money. 3. When you break the stop light there's no penalty nor anything. 4. Whenever you crash it's only your car that's being damaged. 5. There are no levels to the game to say you can unlock a new location or something like that.",

The one thing that I request is if we could unlock 🔓 places, and if you could do that I will give you a five star rating. Bye.😉",

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "Used to be much better. Was a really good game of skill beforehand. Recent update means you are more often than not playing against a computer opponent (you can tell as they always have the same bow, sight, score and arms combination). When this happens, no matter how accurate your shots may be, it has already pre-determined the outcome and adjusts the landing spot of the arrow to accommodate this. This takes all the skill of the game away and it seems pointless playing it now. ☹",
            "As you progress in the game and upgrade your equipment, the game itself becomes more difficult in the same levels. I find this very weird and a bit dishonest, considering some people might even be putting money in upgrades. Example: I just bought a bow sight which cost me more than 22 million gold, and then when I went to use it in the same level which I had been playing, the effects of the wind were stronger, even though it showed the same number and was supposed to be as strong as before.",
            "YO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE HACKERS HITTING 7 BUT SCORING 10. Why are all my opponents using exact same bow and arrow combination? There's no connection issue during ads! This game won't let me exit. There are no Facebook features or ability to play with friends. Mostly bots and hackers. Why are the controls jumpy all of a sudden. This used to be one of the funnest games but it has fallen short of expectations.",
            "It's a fantastic and awestruck game. It's graphics and other various features are great. Those who are interested to install this game can surely install it without any doubts. I like this game very much. Thank you.",
            "Worst Game. This game is full of hackers and lots of bugs. I was winning and rival quit the game still my coins were debited. Sometimes Arrow does not move and time goes up."

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts.

Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\r\n\r\nEnroll in our beta program!

            "This app is awesome if you forget your passwords frequently or want to add an extra layer of security.. The downside is if you change your password and do not have another way to verify your account (send a code to email or phone number) then you're locked out. Make sure your contact preferences are set before linking your account! Also I have noticed the app doesn't link a lot of services; just Facebook, Microsoft, and Google accounts. I'd like to see more accounts able to be linked.",
            "Amazing app, I really appreciate how easy it is to backup your information so when U get a New Phone, it is so much easier to reinstall with all your info. Let me say one thing, without that backup, it is a BE'ATCH to get authentication up⬆ & running again with all your compatible apps! It is very Time Consuming without that Great Backup Feature!!! My only downfall, I am having big problems with PayPal... it is Never the right Code... WHY❓ It is driving me insane & it is really a problem for me❗",
            "Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works perfectly for Microsoft accounts, and is acceptable for others. I can't have all the codes showing at once, which means an extra tap each time I go to use the app, and I'd like to be able to customise icons for accounts to make it easier to spot the one I'm after. Other than minor niggles, I'm good.",
            "I have no choice but to use this app for my organization, but recently it began requiring me to \"unlock\" the app. I had no idea how to do this so I had to Google for an answer. Turns out you have to use your mobile PIN or biometric to unlock the app. I feel like my phone PIN has been compromised and provided to Microsoft. Unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the usage reporting that is enabled by default that I discovered when turning off this unlock feature. Sorry Microsoft, I do not trust you.",
            "I recommend this application. It is convenient to keep your account security verification code secure. When you login, it ensure that no one will login to your account without your permission. I also love this app more than google authentication. You can backup your info link with your email. It is very good when compare to other authentication app."

Daycare 3. Space theme 4. Hospital 5. School i know these already exist but they would be cool to customize. 6. Pets to the customize list 7. Clothes to the customize list. 8. Masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to the list also. I know its a lot and it doesn't effect my game if they don't exist. I love your game! Bye!",
            "This game is amazing I love it so much and it is even better with the free updates , I can not believe they are free! But talking about what is free or not,the game is only starts getting really fun when you make purchases which is not so cool. Over all amazing game it is fun and cool.I love toca boca !!! I hope who ever reads this rewiew has a long awesome life,may you find someone you love and who will cherish you forever . 🤗",
            "I would have given it five star but u can fix the bug that when we keep things in our house from somewhere else and when we reopen the game it goes back in it's original place and the full version of the game is very costly u can at least give the full game for free only for three days trail so that we can see the other places that how it is like and then buy it. But it's the best game for kids worth game.",
            "I absolutely love this game! However I think there is a bug now that they added the Halloween update. I have seen other reviews that say that the houses are total wrecks. Mine is the same. My houses I decorated have furniture just in a pile, and everything else is just purple. Purple walls, outside on the balcony is purple, the floors are purple, and I cant move anything. Please please fix this bug. I have spent a lot of birthday money on this.",
            "The game is overall good, but before I bought the misty cottage. I had an amazing world and I must have atleast spent 5 hours working on it in total. But as soon as I got the misty cottage, the game started glitching out. Early morning the next day I went on the game and my whole world reset. Now that got me upset. I wish to report this app and I want it to be reported and sorted out immediately. I have everything in the game and its around £70 for it all. Not funny at all. Sort it out please"

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",
            "Perfect Mix of Mobile Security & Antivirus Combo For Galaxy Note 4 Running On Android 6.0.1 Everything seems to run well with no issues. I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",
            "I played this game before and I also have rated 5/5 because it was amazing but after these updates it takes 10mins to get into any match even tho I have stable internet connection, I am changing servers but still the problem is there. I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "1)Bugs constitute major part of the game. While playing ball stops at the middle of the pitch and there is no further movement of the ball. Even this bug is in highlights. 2) I don't understand why but after buying players in auction those won't be the same players in the squad and also same players repeat in two teams. 3) Ads don't end up I have to shut down the game and open again every over to play. Better to play without internet. 4) Overall ok game but can't enjoy it as before.",
            "Well, I find this gaming app really interesting and exciting as well. Only one flaw remains to be detected. That's the Blitz Tournament play mode. In this mode, only 2 overs are allowed to either side to show their skills. Now within this 2 overs a side mode, how can one be made to excel their ability ? The development team needs to think over and find a way out of it.",
            "It is a good game . Some improvements can be helpful in this game .Another thing is sometimes the commentator becomes mindless. He says it is six while actually it is out. NPL is so very costly, and maximum people don't even buy it,same for worldcups. If there had been a 4.5rating I would have given that. Overall,like I said it is a good game.",
            "I don't really hate this game. My favourite cricket game is WCC2. But this game has plenty of problems. First, lag issues. Game doesn't actually lag. But when I play, the game gets struck sometimes. I have to close the game and open again. 2nd, in highlights, the batsman is moving till the wide line . And when he hits the ball, he is in the correct position. 3rd, I try to hit the ball straight, but the batsman hits it in leg side. This happens when I try to hit cut shot also. I use Pro control.",

            "Toooooo many ads still... and thats the main reason I will b deleting the game. Always watch this ad to get an advantage. Watch an ad to get a boost. And if you don't use the boost you lose it. Only thing I am sorry for is spending money on here. Paid to get no ads. All rewards and bonuses have ads.",
            "Took away thousands of dollars from league score. Lots of glitches. Says videos available for reward buy then says not available. Did not give me credit for a big auction that I used kick outs on. Game glitches continue. Often says I didn't watch full video. Now special lockers don't have the items guaranteed. A month later still no better. A month later, just happened again",
            "I cannot give this game 5 stars since you are obliged to watch a ridiculous amount of them. In addition, getting VIP doesn't give any daily gold and you still need to watch ads to get powerups and other things. They want you to spend money AND watch ads which is unfortunate. Lastly, sometimes the computer will over bid all rooms so you cannot progress. In addition, it's almost impossible to win big as it seems the computer will bid close to its worth. Other than those issues, this game is fun.",
            "The energy tokens you need to play the game are so slow to arrive, it's painful. It's also weird that the game builds in something to stop folk from playing. Edit: I've uninstalled it just one day later. The ads were annoying enough but sometimes when you try to close them the game crashes and you lose precious tokens it's simply not bearable. I swear I spent much longer watching ads than I did playing the game. Oh, and a couple of screens you can't close so you have to quit losing more tokens.",
            "I love the game but it's just not updating because I'm on level 43 and it keeps saying that the new levels are coming soon and it's been 3 months!! Great game but we can't get any further than level 43, frustrating that it says coming soon !!! Update again today and it's still stuck on locker 42??? Please sort this out ive been waiting ages to progress in the game"

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

        "description": "The Animal wildlands is a dangerous RPG world, where the forest animals guard their territory while hunting and surviving off the land. For centuries, the wolf packs have remained at the top of the food chain, maintaining the natural order, led by their alpha, the last remaining dire wolf. When the dire wolf goes missing, you must lead your pack to greatness. Select a gray wolf or a black wolf, and start building your ultimate wolfpack. A wild life simulation adventure awaits!\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE MULTIPLAYER BATTLES - PVP\r\n\r\nFight for dominance in the virtual world! Take on the world in online real-time multiplayer PvP battles.

Will you be the hunter or the hunted?\r\n\r\nUPGRADE YOUR BATTLE SKILLS\r\n\r\nCreate your ultimate RPG hero - you can choose which skills to learn and upgrade. Unique skills range from basic MMORPG abilities to fantasy elemental attacks - and even stealth skills which allow you to hide in the forest and become the ultimate predator!\r\n\r\nBREED & RAISE CUBS\r\n\r\nBuild a family and role play! A realistic breeding sim gives cubs stronger fighting attributes compared to their parents. Take your pups out with you as you raid other clans and hunt your prey. Your pups will watch your every move, learning important survival and life skills. Trail your pup well, else they will not stand a chance in the online multiplayer PvP battle arena.\r\n\r\nCOLLECT ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe alpha is the hero of each pack. You can duel enemy clans and recruit their alpha to your den. Collect wolves, foxes, bears and other wild animals, each with realistic and fantasy evolution skins. Each creature is rendered in stunning 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nLIVE THE STORY OF A WOLF CLAN\r\n\r\nA true survival simulator. When nature’s balance is threatened as the Great River has become contaminated, competition between the animals over the remaining spring water has begun. Even foreign tigers have been spotted far outside of their borders, causing concern amongst the rest of the animals.\r\n\r\nThere have also been rumours of ancient reptiles, rising to the surface from centuries of slumber, claiming the mountains and caves as their own. The gray wolves are now called upon to craft a solution in these troubled times.\r\n\r\nA MASSIVE OPEN WORLD\r\n\r\nExplore a huge, unbroken open MMO world teeming with wild life, from the dense forest, mountains to the freezing arctic. You can fight in online multiplayer PvP areas, tackle quests, role play, gather resources or raid enemy clans and take over their home.

            "Directional pad isn't very good. Try to move straight forward and can only go slightly left or right of straight, so I just move forward in a bit of a zig zag motion. Got to the first big enemy and hit it once. After that, I could not move (directional pad disappeared completely), nor could I attack. I just stood there while the ogre attacked me repeatedly. Reloaded 5 times with the same result. Too bad, it looks like a pretty good game.",
            "Linear, not open. Colorful, but no real decision making. Couldn't even start the tutorial without encountering begging ads. Pretty lousy intro to a game, but typical of low quality, greedy game makers. Especially ones from China or non US game makers. This game is Korean, so all glitz, nothing original or deep. As we all expect I recieved the standard, insincere, automated reply from the game developer. It always the lie that shows the greed which dominates the gaming business.",
            "Went here to tell something. I did enjoy this game BUT I have this very annoying scenario when i get to duel or team pvp with players who are high ranked per se and it really sucks because it tends me, my character to lag or freeze or *my connection's poor or whatever even though I got a good internet service. Can we do something about that? I don't have other problems encountered with the game other than that.",
            "Gameplay is excellent and customisation options are great. Only one thing mars the whole experience, and that is the constant begging to spend money, the same offer came up 8 times in the space of three minutes. Surely the programming can be changed so it realises that once you have rejected an offer, you don't want it. IF I decide to keep playing I may decide to take up on some offers, but until then I cannot in good conscience give this more than a 3 star review.",
            "This game is good, but there are major problems. 1) Most PVP is pay to win I say most because if you manage properly you don't have to buy anything. But it really comes down to who is willing to buy more. They do try and counter this by giving beginners chances to get S rank gear. But fighting in campaign with S rank gear becomes a chore when clearing stages instead of fun and challenging. 2) Their team matching system is pretty wack. High lvs get put with low lvs which causes imbalance."

            "I LOVE LOVE LOOOOOVE THE GAME!! although there is a problem. When the new update happened I couldn't log on. It would just freeze. I uninstalled and reinstalled ( which resulted in me losing everything ) I could log on again!!! Then, later, when I tried to log on it did the same thing. Pls fix IT!!!!! I wanna play I love it sooo much!!!!! If you don't, it will break my heart",
            "This Game is super fun! I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!! Well we should be a new app from witch we can style our phones. Thank you for such an amazing game! I♥PK XD!!!...",
            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

            "Game is really good. But it can be taken to the next level. Some things I would really love in the game are - 1. Multiplayer mode, 2. Net shots can be better. It shows ' Perfect ' and still hits the net, 3. Not able to defend the smash but the AI defends the smash, 4. Endurance sometimes doesn't work as it claims. 5. Body language can also be improved in each shot. Apart from these, the game is well made.",
            "This is probably one of the best Badminton game on the market. BUT, there's a huge issues that i need to address... FIRST OF, the \"Frozen Time\" special ability in the game is probably the most annoying part of it. Not only that this ability makes the game much more unrealistic (even though it's just a \"mini game\"), but also it makes the game to become imbalance. SECOND OF, when the player beginning to run out of stamina, then suddenly i couldn't even smash the ball while midair. FIX THIS PLEASE",
            "Guest login gives you a random name, can't change the name even though I have google games installed, no achievement or progress there. I don't use facebook there is no other option. The difficulty is not there at all, The AI is completely predictable after few levels. I reached ACE in a day, still no challenge. Apart from all this, I enjoy playing this game.",
            "I played this game ages ago because I was addicted to badminton and was so impressed by what I thought was an online badminton game. This turned out to be single player and i felt quite betrayed, however coming back to it knowing its single player with everything they've added has made me so happy, the shot selection options is so pleasing from someone who has played for many years and its good to see some variations from hit short, hit long, smash. With drive shots etc. The game is very fun.",
            "Yes I have played this game for 2months it was nice but it has some issues and they are 1. It doesn't support solo vs solo from large distances like a person from another city and another city. 2. Their must be some more controls like places and techniques 3. The abiltes are not too fair . If these were resolved I hope I may give 5 🌟 star to it"

And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "I like it and had fun but it made me install one more app and there are adds. I only have one game without adds and I think they should have less adds although it is a fun game over all. I definitely think kids of all ages should play this game. This is an honest review and I really hope doing this helped you. Have a great day. Happy Halloween.",
            "Because you get adverts every 2 seconds and there's men naked and my child is playing this and she says Mummy doesn't need it now and I'm like and it's just it's just complicated and basically I don't get why anyone ever would up like this game and it would know why I rated it 2 stars 0 stars is this game keep carrying on I will I will lose my mind and it will not be or I will never do I will I will like girls go crazy and it will not know for every bone in my body is telling me to let go",
            "A small in game fit in a Bunch of Ads.. TOO MANY ADS It is one of the most pathetic games i might have played. Each level is barely 10 seconds but after each level, there's a 30 seconds ad. And every other thing is just so poorly designed, there's no good gameplay.. there's no good game either.. it's just a few unconnected levels fit around many, many ads",
            "Well I was playing the game and there were so many ads and there 30 seconds ads😠. Then I played it again and it keep on glitching for me I really don't think you should play this game cause it is really annoying 😠. but if you wanna play it play at ur own risk. But if none of this happens to you then your lucky."

            "Historically this is a great and useful app, but most recently there are a ton of issues. 1, it crashes time and again. 2, other users also say they can't save photos. 3, my saved faves folder has disappeared. 4, latest version didn't need to change, just needed bug fixes, but the new version has not got the same features. 5 iPhone version has nose slimming but android version only has contouring which is not that useful",
            "I love this app, don't get me wrong. But just recently whenever I create a look and try to save it, the photo would usually go to my Perfect365 folder located in my gallery. Now, when I save a photo I can't find it anywhere!! I tried Uninstalling and reinstalling the app... Nothing and it's very disappointing because I use this app often... Please fix this!!",
            "Too many bugs, too many ads, would pay for pro if the app worked. Can't find any saved photos now, app crashes all the time, the ads in app cause more bugs, very slow, very glitchy. Too much happening and very poor quality. I only use it when I want to change the hair color on my pics now cuz nothing else works or looks good.",
            "It won't allow me to save my pics and then be able to post it to a social media like before. I click save over and over and nothing. Its very irritating and hope you guys can do something to fix it!! It used to let me save and post and then they would all be in my \"perfect365\" albumn in my pics. This was one of my favorite apps. But this is so disappointing!! 😕😔"

He then realized that a lot of time and effort was being spent on searching for suitable precedents to the case and figured it would be interesting to develop a search engine as easy to use as Google for Indian Law. After much research, analysis and discussion with law firms the basic outline of our product LegalCrystal was chalked out.\r\n\r\nOur Philosophy\r\n\r\nOur product is a simple and effective search for law, which does not require any training to use. By keying in a phrase, our product retrieves judgments related to that phrase delivered by all Courts. Users have access to the complete library and can search and research in one single window for a judgment supporting any \"Point of Law\".\r\n\r\nLegalCrystal serves three major segments - advocates/judges, law firms and companies/businesses, although even laymen can use it. It is based on a yearly subscription and an annual fee. At the end of each year, the user renews his subscription which will activate the value added services / features. Access to Judgments / Search is free, you only pay for Bonus features.\r\n\r\nIndian Law & LegalCrystal\r\n\r\nAncient India represented a distinct tradition of law, and had a historically independent school of legal theory and practice. Since then the law has evolved from religious prescription to the current constitutional and legal system we have today, traversing through secular legal systems and the common law.\r\n\r\nIndia, being one of the major game player in the IT sector, recently took active efforts to present all laws along with their amendments at indiacode.nic.in and all court judgments at judis.nic.in Also, there are few other private companies which do similar work. However a majority of these have failed to implement an efficient and effective law search engine hence making the effort futile as people spend a lot of time manually searching through a huge set of links and gauging their relevance.\r\n\r\nTo tackle these issues, our core development team developed an innovative and efficient search engine which provides quick results and is easy to use. If you are a Judge, Attorney, Judicial Officer or a person seeking Indian Law, then the entire Indian law database from the year 1850 (approx.) till date has being digitized and powered with an effective search for your benefit.",

            "It's great except today when I went to use nearly all of it on buying funny money for a game I play, only a portion of it showed up as my play balance. There was almost $10 unaccounted for, and no, that money had not expired. It was missing from the current balance shown in the app. This is very annoying and now I can't get what I wanted to.",
            "Still good 1yr l8r. You get random questions depending on your personal allowances on your phone. You answer a few questions and get some money from it. The amount of money depends on the survey but it all adds up!! It's easy to use your balance. This app doesn't take over your notifications. It'll notify you then leave you alone. I enjoy that aspect since so many other app continue to bombard you with reminder after reminder. I would recommend this app to anyone who want just a bit extra money.",
            "Easy to accrue google rewards. I either use on a mobile game or audio books, but there a plenty more options. Easy way to get play money, although it takes a little while to accrue a decent amount, but for the small amount of time investment it is super simple. Since August 30, 2018 until now, Oct 29, 2020 I have acquired $118.85 and I have completed 467 surveys. Some may worry about giving information, to me...I don't really care.",
            "I havent gotten a single survey since I downloaded the app, I have no idea of that is on purpose or not, but I really had hoped to have been able to get at least on survey, but I havent and so I feel that there is little to no reason to have the app...at least for me to have it, but everyone says its great, and so I'm hoping in a future update, yall add more surveys, and spread them out fairly.",
            "Super easy to do. I kinda even wish it asked me surveys more frequently. I love this app, all the small amounts eventually add up. It's too bad the money express though, and that you you can only buy things from the play store that you have the balance to pay for entirely from your Google balance, you can't for example use $10 of Google money that you have and then pay the rest with a different payment source"

            "The controls are terrible, you constantly get spawned next to bigger players, and the battle royal mode doesnt even work. It loads for a second and takes you straight back to the main page. Waste of time. Also, every button you press will probably popup an add, 6 things you have to close out of, and then another add. I get you need money, but you dont have to annoy me about it.",
            "Fun game but too many ads and popups about the VIP. If you're lucky you won't spawn next to 3 other massive players, and if you're lucky the game picks up your inputs quick enough so you don't get eaten in 1 second. The game lags constantly no matter what Internet speed which means there's a big chance you'll drift off right into someone else. Ads after every 2 matches is too much to make it enjoyable. You might as well just restart the app after every single match.",
            "DO NOT DOWNLOAD, this game is terrible now and is just getting milked. Constant ads to buy things, servers are laggy even on 220mbps internet which is a pretty good speed, server matching is terrible because it will throw you into servers where some of the people are half the size of the map and one move will kill everyone making you go back to the menu and see more ads. Just terrible at this point and mony hungry",
            "Evreything is fun amazing and great. Great mobile port for agar only problem is if ur unlucky you will load up classic mode and spawn right next to a freaking giant and your screwed at that point its i little frutrating. Controls need some tweking i can never stand still. I rate this a honest 4 stars didint quite make that 5 becuse of the thing i talked about id toatlly recommend it however ig you have a laptop or a pc i think you should play it on that instead untill said issues are resuled",
            "I cant express how much i love this came however a few days ago i bought a really cool skin which wad 3900 coins, i loved it but when i went on to play today the skin had disappeared and now i dont have it. I dont even have the coins back. Over all iys a really cool game🙂"

            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

It has nothing to do with it being mosty free, which is up to you to pay, but with all the free options, I have no idea what's included with the paid version! A MUST DOWNLOAD!! ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!! Thanks so much for such an awesome Photo Editing App!! Keep up the AWESOME WORK!!",
            "besides the excessive ads and the impending fear of not being able to use the app at all (for the purpose I downloaded it for) thanks to the forceful hand of a monthly-paid membership,, this app works great. it's literally the only thing I've found where I'm able to edit moodboards the way I've been wanting to, so I thank it for that",
            "This app is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for like 2 years now. If you understand all the features (which are so many), you won't ever need any other photo editing app. It has no logos after making a collage or editing, great layouts , different sizes with ratios and options while making collage to crop , swap , delete , anything. You can choose the border or just have no borders. it's just awesome. Thanks for the app makers.",
            "Like flying for the first time. Like a pool on a hot summer day in Modesto. Like a cup of hot chocolate on Christmas. Like checking ALL the boxes on your daily to do list. Like having all the laundry folded after watching an episode of the magicians, except that towel you used to wipe your tears with. Like strawberry bingsu in loser angeles in August. Like hugging your mom. Like reaching Challenger in Starcraft. Like making before after pictures of when you finally clean. Like comment subscribe.",
            "Very nice app ...I accidentally uninstall this up and I almost cry ..good thing after searching for days I found it..this is very useful in making invitations..I just wish you add more text options, calligraphy,and color like gliter effect on text .good thing this is update new effects were add..kudos to the developer..keep up the good work."

I am going to have to uninstall because I am using Android on laptop without touch and playing on a phone is hard on the eyes. If you fixed these things, I would give 5 stars and continue to play.",
            "New developers are listening at least. Now this is so far a temporary 5 stars, they have to continue to make the game playable. It's in a fairly good state for active players currently. If you find yourself with Google play cards laying around and nothing seems to interest you, this game is very social and has several communities to join. Will things burn, probably, but that's slowly becoming less of an account destroying experience. If the new developers screw it up, I'll re-review again.",
            "The game is all about pay to play. If you try to play it for free, you'll get so far behind that it is ridiculous. The cost to level up of resources and scrolls is unbelievably expensive. The events don't even tailor to your level (that's how they get you to pay to stay caught up). This game is absolutely horrible. Oh, if you try to contact customer service, you'll get a copy and paste response. They don't care about their players. FYI, the packs go up to the $100's.",
            "It's rated PEGI 7 , but requires purchases that cost more than the average persons weekly shopping. Getting kids to spend £95 on a pack is criminal, (they claim it's free to play) that's also false advertising. You can spend £95 on one hero, then a few days later a new hero will be available which is much better than the one you just bought, that makes your purchase useless. The releases are fast which encourages you to spend more, not much good to say . 👍",
            "I've spent my fair share of money on this game. Developers have no control or care. They allow lvl 50-60 wipe out lower lvl players and allows them to do whatever. If they intended this game to be fun for all they have fail miserably. I've sent tickets in for them to limit 50-60 level players to attack no lower than level 35 so the rest of us can compete. This is a pay to play kind of game, if you don't pay dont play because there's no use."

            "Awesome! 🎉🎊Never imagined mountain climbing could be fun 😎 Had to learn the move then it's smooth climbing, ofcourse at some point difficulty arise yet interesting 👌👌👌 The fellow is not Tom Cruise 😀 more like Rambo! Infinite life, short check points so never frustrating, Great game 👍 Could have added music. Simple, clear, pleasing graphics 🏆",
            "this game not only requires skill but also thinking. it's a game of awareness and you have to be accurate to win. I personally quite enjoy this game although there can be different perspectives from others. honestly I enjoy this game and I recommend others to play it as well. But there can be small impovements it does not have to be not major ones. I love this game!",
            "I have an idea. It might counter the games name but its ok. Have a skyscraper thats being built. There will be metal bars or cement blocks instead of rocks. Also have a crane thats carrying either of the two I that just said. The crane will move it side to side. You must turn the broken rocks into the things that I said but with an engineer on top of it. As you climb on it, the engineer will step on your hand. As you reach the top, the owner will kick you out making you go to the next skysc/mt."

            "The game is a good game, dont get me wrong. But there are 3 big things that are issues for me. One, is that the game is very complicated. There is so much stuff when you open the menu, I feel it would be better even if it was a little more \"basic\". Also, there are lots of ads, which I mean the game has to make money. Lastly, it needs a strong internet connection to play, and I feel an offline mode would be nice.",
            "I have been playing this game for over 3 years and I was just starting to get somewhere with a purchased rod and reel. The posiden rod 5 stars stats were rather good then with a successful evolution to a 6 star rod it gives me garbage stats I would expect from a 3 star rod and no way to go back to my previous rod. The stats on evolution should be a comparison or better of the 2 rods your using to improve the one you already have. Not the garbage it gave me. You could answer your emails.",
            "Really cool option to play as if your phone is an actual fishing pole W/ phones gyro. You progress quickly & are given enough free loot to start and keep the game going as you progress to earn higher level equipment and achievements. Graphics are great, controls are very easy and straight forward. Also very accurate in the depiction of the different types of fish that you would actually catch. Game accurately depicts the fish that are indigenous to the areas you fish in the game. Overall GREAT!!",
            "If you cant play for a while you will lose your guild and all the money and hard work you put in will be give to someone on your team and they wont talk and don't fish much this suck by far thus the 1 star rating a bot in control of my guild you email for help and they tell you its nothing they can do you have to w8 till person misses 20 days or more im pissed as all hell because I worked at the hospital when rona popped up and had to work doubles i had no time to check in. I want all my $ back",
            "It should have higher quality graphics setting. Good game, but the graphics is still stuck in 2014. It doesn't look good on a FHD screen."

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

            "Honestly, I've played this game before, so I got it again, only to be disappointed. Whenever I create (or try to) my viking, it stops at the name and says there is a problem registering my viking. Other people are having this issue, but I will keep the game and see if it's resolved soon. Jumpstart Games, fix your game, please.",
            "It's overall a good game that I can spend my time on, but there are a lot of issues that makes many people frustrated. The infamous Battle Event glitch keeps appearing and it sucks. Also, stop changing the Battle Event rewards for the events. I just want to farm gems without engaging in the event, but it forces me to get candy instead. Events should be, well, an event that gives players an option to engage in it or not. Thawfest was the reason why I kept the game uninstalled for months.",
            "It has been awesome playing this game and I love it !!!!!!! I'm glad that you fixed the wild dragon disappearing thing !! But .....I can't do like ....anything ! Cuz you have to pay money for gems and you can't do anything if you don't have gems ! I'd love it if you made there be less coin spending on the new quests and stuff like that !! Please do !!",
            "This game is great.... except that the chat system is awful (the chat is a tad bit too censored and you could get banned for a simple mistake, even though they don't even tell what you said wrong, they just tell you that you said something wrong), the graphics aren't the best, but not the worst, and the controls (especially for decorating the farm) are kinda terrible. But, I suppose it is somewhat decent if you look past the issues. Also, the teen dragons are very glitchy and broken.",
            "It's a fun game overall, but it's also a Pay-to-Win game. You either have to spend money on memberships or gems to do any of the fun quest, or grind for months. I have a membership account and it gets boring because theres no quests until a big update. You should add daily quest to level up your dragons, or just to do something fun. And I also get constantly get \"Logged Out\" of the game. Please fix that. And the chat is horrible. I can't say Hi or I get muted. But overall, it's a decent game."

            "You'll hear this a lot. Game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ready to spend time to build your own little city you can do it without any diamonds, premium currency. Community is really helpful and good guild can make all the difference for one to stick with the game. It can be played on both mobile and browser, which is great because as city grows more time is needed to get it to run optimally.",
            "Unbalanced game play, players with much a bought stronger army can attack and plunder your items, super slow game play unless you're a pay player, I've been stuck for sometimes a week or more trying gain or trade for items to advance research, like I stated before if you throw real money at the game you can buy your way to the top a thousand times faster.",
            "Great game! If you're looking to \"beat\" a game, this isn't it. It's a slow roll, even slower if you don't purchase diamonds. The game play is good, and even at a slow pace, I'm entertained. I do have a suggestion though.. I'd like to be able to sell my buildings to other users, especially in my guild. If I could get forge points, goods, etc instead of auction $, the game would be even more interesting.",
            "Great game. However, a couple of suggestions 1. Please add a currently online/offline feature for players to see. Doesnt have to be seen by everyone, maybe just by friends and guild mates. 2. Please add in a last online feature for friends and guild mates to see. It is very hard to manage friends and guild list when you have no idea who are active and inactive players. 3. I find this game compared to most hardly gives out the in game currency(diamonds). Maybe try handing slightly more to players",
            "The game is so bugged I can't even start playing it right, but also I have it's a pay to play game . I've put my 10$ in this game to see if it's worth it, but honestly didn't even reach the point where I use them cause game won't load event or story and so on.... In short- no."

            "I have to say the graphics are really good, but sometimes, the ref gives a foul or yellow card when it is clearly not a foul. But the quality is good and in multiplayer, although it lags, it has exciting gameplay. I was and I am still critical because you have removed DLS 19, but this sort of wins it back. Pl focus on the improvements and add DLS 19 ( if possible)",
            "Easily could've gotten 5 star with the gameplay itself. But ads every half time is terrible. I do watch ads to get extra coins so no need to put it at the half time. Also the cost for stadium is too expensive. You really expect the player to score 10 goals every game? Can't improve the squad and have to watch ads after every game just for the stadium upgrade bullcrap. That's just plain stupid.",
            "So many things to improve. 1. The analog joystick. When my players make a long shot, the ball still move towards the goalkeeper even when I move the joystick to the top corner of the goal. 2. The goalkeeper's reaction doesn't make sense. Even the GK from PES still can be defeated at short range, unlike the GK in DLS 20. 3. The goalkeeper still error. You can review that game again. I don't know how to explain it ~_~",
            "Out of all of the football games I have played, the controls and smooth gameplay that DLS offers is far better than the competition. PES and Fifa struggle to create such a unique and lag free experience, but every year DLS improves their already superior controls. DLS is in no way a pay to win game like Fifa and is a very enjoyable game. Everything about it is a 10/10 from me.",
            "I love this game and wanted to give 5* but damn! Some things really piss me off. 1. Why don't we have control over how we upgrade our players anymore? 2. Why don't we have the options to sell our players for money 🤦 Now the multiplayer experience is getting worse. It will disconnect even if there's strong network connection. And the other person wins. And your team's fitness drops.... Too bad"

The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

Wanted a wireless number that I do not have. All I want to do is pay my bills. I go through some kind of B.S. every month. Between being on the phone and using the simple AT&T app I have been at this for well over an hour, and still have not paid my bill. Ridiculous!",
            "Update: Originally I could never pay my bill with the app. I always had to call in and explain the difficulties each time. The last 2 or 3 payments have been made so smoothly I would have to say this is now one of the better apps I use. Thanks for fixing all of the issues I have noticed. Original post: This app is absolutely junk. I have so much difficulty with paying my bill each and every month. It just sits there spinning gaining no traction.",
            "I don't really know how good this works. It seems to be working a little bit better now, but it is still having problems remembering my USER ID AND PASSWORD. OH Well, I really hope that is just temporary. On one page it thinks it's 1 thing and on another page it thinks they are something else. For the third time, THIS APP OFFICIALLY STILL WON'T LET ME SIGN IN!😠😠😡😤 OTHER than that I guess it's ok.",
            "Its been 2 months that me and my wife switched from Verizon to ATT, and yet have been able to get login into an online account. We have spent many hours trying to get this resolved with att and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue, still to this day nothing has been done. The customer service is very unprofessional, and possibly undertrained. I've never had such issues with Verizon and Verizon service is always top notch. Will be back with Verizon after our two years are up.",
            "This app is garbage. You would think AT&T would be sure the app was functioning properly so people could spend money with them, open new accounts, etc., But instead this app literally never works right. It always crashes. It's just garbage. Which reflects AT&T well because none of their stuff ever works. Their service is garbage. And their CUSTOMER SERVICE is even worse. This is so sub par. Verizon is far superior in every way. Unfortunately I live in the woods and AT&T is only one that works"

            "This is one of the best games Gameloft has created and entertained the world. MUST READ: I have been playing this game since it's release and have grown watching its updates and its growth. I have played it since then on the PC. And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's. And give it missing fighter's in sphere. Please GoR. when we will get new pvp and update. In my phone game is not opening please fixed the errors. From 7 days my game is not opening showing errors. Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

        "comments": [
            "It's a decent game, however when I approach a red light, and don't go through it, it says I went through it and I lose XP for no reason. Another note, Can you add sound mods for the passengers to communicate, and add ticket machines to use, it would be realistic and a better experience. It would be cool if you terminated at a bus station, and had timetables, for when you next leave and approach a bus stop. If you could add a button to click called \"Driver Shift\" which you click, (optional).",
            "Great game but there might not be traffic if they can they should add sort of realistic traffic and one more bus a Triple decker with 4 wheels on each side at back and front 2 on each side. So if you can do that this will be the best and most comfortable game to play but it is very comfortable already. Thank you. And I hope you can do it soon.",
            "It's a great game, but it needs some tweaking: 1. Passengers seem to fall off their seats quite easily, especially when going around corners. 2.Traffic and pedestrians don't always seem to be aware of their surroundings. 3. Being very close to traffic lights triggers the game into thinking I'm running a red light. 4. The vehicle selection menu would be much easier to use if it were tile/card-based. Other than that, I've thoroughly enjoyed playing the game! I hope to see more buses in the future.",
            "This is a good bus simulator but there are a few things I wish could change, these are: I wish the rain graphics would be better, the people graphics would be better, I wish there would be more controls for example: being able to turn the cabin lights on/off, the air conditioning on/off etc. And I've noticed a bug with the game, when I slow down and the press on the gas pedal it says I crashed it's very annoying and finally I wish there would be buses on the road and the passengers would talk",
            "This game is pretty decent overall, I like the XP system and the bus models and so on, what I don't like is very petty and can hopefully be easily solved. 1. The AI sometimes put the hazards on and brakecheck you then making your passengers fall over. 2. I would like to see the route creation system work better and 3. I wish you could put letters in the route number, apart from that this game is amazing! Thumbs up to the devs!"

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",
            "I have reached out to support team multiple times still no results. I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

            "This game is ok I would never play this in my freetime, and I don't like the animaton. It's terrible and the animation sucks! It looks like the creator just rushed it when it could have been a good game but you rushed it. If your pregnant and you want to learn about being pregnant I do recommend, but for all of you that are not, look at something else!!!",
            "The is perfect for pregnant women. It teaches you everything i am very proud of the creators. But the reason i reduced a star because you cannot operate the woman that's a little disappointing. Creators if you are reading this its a humble request to add this feature please please. I love this game and i dont want to uninstall it.",
            "Very good game...portrays a pregnant mother's life accurately. Excellent! The only thing is that I felt the 'Baby Care' level a bit boring. The rest was all excellent! Going to hospital, ordering items from iPhone....very good. Just improve 'Baby Care' level and then include more and more of levels...overall, nice game!👍👍 sufficient to get 4 stars!!",
            "FINALLY A GAME WITH EASY CONTROLS !!!!!! I love this game I just wish it had more levels and more to do so far everything is so accurate! Maybe giving baby a bath more levels of baby getting older feeding him in a high chair changing clothes etc mom cooking going to the store taking baby for a walk in stroller or if baby grows and walks as a toddler take him to play ! I'm just glad theres no timer either ! I totally love this game so I'll keep it downloaded and wait for more levels ! Great game!",
            "This app is amazing the little details are so incredible! It feels so realistic however there are some small issues in my opinion I don't understand why when you buy clothes on the pregnancy app it shows dresses and a t-shirt, if she can only wear the track suits why not just have her buy the track suits instead of the dresses? Also it's a little annoying that when you have a baby boy he's in a super girly nursery I think all the baby stuff should had been made gender neutral. Great game tho!"

The batsman should celebrate after 50 or 100.",

It's very frustrating esp for the harder levels when you're so close to winning.",

            "This game is awful. So many bugs need to be fixed, such as, the skateboard when it makes me slow, people shooting me through my walls, people teleporting to the top of my custom build, and people gazing through my builds. You have ignored all of these glitches and all you do is steal money from creators such as N1KE, who was an avid player. I'd rather not play a game that was made by people who steal money from others.",
            "i am pretty idicted to this game. but it dosn`t have any storyline so far and it would be cool if they added some change to the map, so some times it gets boring. more things is that you need to have molha to buy cool skins because its so hard to get daimonds. other than that i love it",
            "Honestly this game is really fun but I kinda think the game is just not really for people that get raged I kinda get raged but like this game also has way to many hackers like shooting threw walls and ambit and some people I faced were using like invincibility and obviously everyone hates hackers so if those people can get like banned or something the game would be a lot more fun",
            "The game is nice but there are to many update. Almost every week there is a new update. It's just to much to handle. For those who want to download the game do it at your own risk. A'd the creators of the game please fix this please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",
            "There is alot of bugs and drop frames iam playing this game from season 1 and every season it become worse 😑 we need new things new weapons new places and better fps i can't play if my builds are lvl 3 or higher and I should play on 60 fps but icant because there is alot of drop frames I play on 40 fps or 50 max please 🙏 fix your game 😔"

            "Fun and addicting game! I really dont like the first person camera view. I see more vehicle then anything else. I also noticed a glitch when taking a log, rock or car to a build or challenge circle. Sometimes it won't release the item in the circle. The turning controls, especially on the helicopters, could use some work too. But other then that! I love it! Needs more maps!",
            "Good game. With only 5 maps, unfortunately, need more maps to make this game more interesting. Wide terrain for each map, with so many mini games inside each of map. To bad we only get to hold 3 card slot, with so many out there to collect. Take too long to get another vehicle unless we paid, but all and all, this game make me want to play every time.",
            "This game is one of the best off road games and yes it looks better then you think too it has really good realistic sounds and lots of things to do and the truck you start out with is a some and sounds good it also has a realistic damage model on all the cars and all I can say is a game like this is hard to find on the play store it's like something you would get on a PC or game system",
            "Nice game, but it needs some simple additions such as adding some people to the game because I feel lonely in the game. Or I feel that it lacks some natural things, such as some animals, such as some birds. And make the weather in the game change with time. And something like day and night will make the game more beautiful. It misses some simple things, but those things will give more beauty to the game",
            "This games honestly got a lot packed into it for a free game and although the grinds do force you to become a grinding sloth it's still fairly enjoyable. no idea how I'm going to collect 300 let alone 2500 cards for a vehicle when there's at least 60 vehicles and you only get 5 or so cards for a vehicle at a time (and it takes 8hrs). would be worth it for a once off 6.99, even $12 purchase. Catch is, you're gonna have to cough up 6.99 every month if you want to try all the vehicles \"for free\""

            "Great App for total piece of mind. However, if you \"dump\" your phone, like I just did, you have to reinitialize the Authenticator on each and every website you had it enabled just as if you had changed your phone or phone number. I forgot to make a list of each of my websites I was using the App on, so I'm having to \"discover\" them as I access them. Yeah, it's a pain, but if it wasn't, the App would be nothing but window dressing.",
            "Another application that helps me make Google that much easier, faster and more convenient for me. I am so glad to see that Google is getting more and more usefer friendly ~ anyone who is interested in learning more about how to use, find or become an expert in the any subject go to \"Google Education\". 🙃 Basically, the authenticor is a great place to use as a second sign in step. It is paperless easy to find, get and use. I am so glad to be able to use this link for my own 2 step varifacation",
            "When I first downloaded this app it worked great. I changed phones and the directions to switch were a little hard to follow but doable. This last update messed my app up because my phone died and I had to replace it. I was able to update it through my Gmail but codes were not working for apps. My old phone doesn't work so no way to transfer from it. I was able to get into FB and turn it off through my laptop. Otherwise I couldn't use it or messenger on my phone.",
            "Make it clear that your accounts don't transfer over to a new device like every other Google app, as I am now locked out of my accounts frantically digging around trying to recover them. It's great at protecting your account but if you lose your device, or get a new one and forget to manually transfer them over I wish you luck.",
            "The worst app which Google has ever created. Do they not ever considered what happened to those customers whom lost their phones? how are we able to transfer an old accounts if the previous phones were LOST. You, Google, has locked me out of several accounts and offer no other options available of unlocking it. This is a shameful act. Do not use this!"

I used to love checking out sales on the app, but its a huge pain now since they completely removed filters like sort by price or alphabetically. Also they bafflingly don't show game titles in plain text anymore(only box art) and some are really hard to read if the text is too small.",
            "New update to the PS Store is a major downgrade. Wishlists are gone which is what I used to keep track of the games I wanted to buy. Browsing through the store is slow and painful now that they only show you box covers instead of easy to read text. Many box covers are hard to read and don't differentiate between full games and addons. This new layout is going lead to me purchasing a much smaller number of games in the future do to the new increased difficulty of finding anything.",
            "The integration of the ps store is great to see as well. I don't know if I'm blind tho but it's a shame the wishlist isn't in the app. Edit: From 4 to 3 stars Also comparing trophies isn't possible anymore and it seems they really emphasized their blogs now. Not everyone reads articles. If you have given special treatment towards the people who like reading articles, hopefully you'd bring back the basic ones you haven't included and removed."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "It's one of the best dress up apps out there, there's plenty of items and (so far) there doesn't seem to be a limit on saved dolls. It would be cool if they added a way to sort your characters into folders of sorts so that it's easier to find a character you're looking for. Edit: After the last update I started getting adds on the top and bottom of my screen again even though I previously paid to remove them. Down to three stars until this is resolved.",
            "Oh my!This game is F.A.B,I just really adore the details!YOUR GRAPHICS ARE REAAAAALLY GOOD👍!!! I hope my reccomendations help!: Pls add the ability to choose earings,neclaces,sleeves,shirts,pants etc. and i hope we can change the colors! I want more eye designs and be able to color them+They can blink! If we could add like animations that make the hair look like its flying by the wind it would be cool! 😮 add poses and i wanna be able to make stories with this app,anything pls! #SORECOMMENDED!",
            "I really enjoy this app! It's fun, creative, and has beautiful music.There are only 2 things it's missing: 1: if you could change the colours on everything (eyes, clothes, shoes ect.) that would be great! 2: it would be fab if you could put your chibi doll in different poses, as I think the regular standing pose is a bit boring.",
            "This game is very fun it is amazing it's a creating a character it's just like God's club but very different than go to club I love it so much I love how you can like change the look of your characters so much but I wish they would add somewhere that you can makeup a name for your character but it is very fun it's a very creative fashionable game well not that fashionable 😂😂😂😂😂 Well download it if you haven't",
            "Great game so awesome game 8 year old girl so good I recommend you make more games like this ... I'm a fan of MLP my little pony .. I made a mlp chibi dolls so great hope you upgrade .. the game ..or make more like this game.. 😀😃👍👍👍👍👍......"

            "This app was my favorite one at a time it was relaxing and makes me happy but now it is a very bad app . Coz till fifth level we sell ice creams in a motorcycle like thing but when we finish the fifth level it says that the road is rocky so we should pay an amount and get a big van to sell the ice cream. And if we look other characters shop and sell ice creams like blueberry muffins shop . They are closed we should complete all levels of the strawberry shortcake's shop and then get them .",
            "My kids like the strawberry shortcake games and I am even happy to pay for the DLC which I did for this. Unfortunately its locked to my account so even though the kids share a tablet as they have their own accounts. I dont want to pay for everything twice so I'm not buying any more DLC.",
            "It is fun...but you only get 4 levels for free which is pretty dissapointing. There are not many things for free.",
            "The game is a 5 star but I gave it 3 Stars because you have to pay for the game and I cant complete it now sorry if you fix the game then I will give it 5 stars but until then it stays as a 3 star game sorry (just my opinion by the way)",
            "It was a complete 5 star experience, simple and easy to learn building up sequences to fulfill the orders. The issue is without paying the game can not be completed, which is still ok as the effort of development deserves the money, but today we realized the already completed demo regions can not be played for free anymore... This was an awful experience, the price is fair but this action made it considerable to pay.."

            "Part1. Game play is too fake. The whole idea is to generate money by making the pre-fold best hand lose so the players keeps buying chips to continue playing. No doubt about it. Nobody should download this game. You will lost all your chips on the river card. Just make sure play with only free money. Don't buy chips. Worst ever game!!!!!! I noticed that they will only reply on good reviews and only technical feedback. Never have they commented how is suck. How much money does this game make?",
            "The game itself is good. However for those who play frequently the winning chance are almost 0.01%. Although they said the 'algorithm' is fair. It is not true. If you have a winning streak for example there would be a time where you will be losing your money, thus it will pushes the player to buy chips using your own money. Its a not good game. For a player like me don't like to spent too much money on game that doesn't rewards us of anything.",
            "Like all the others, it sucks you in fast and then you have to pay to compete. They give you a lot of free chips for a couple days and then you need to buy chips to complete because the adds don't even cover one buy in and the bonuses slow down to almost non existent. No long term, top, player in this game exist without consistent in game purchases. Why can't we just play a poker game without pretending to be billionaires? Just play poker and watch an ad here and there if needed. Greed",
            "Put simply with the new greedy higher Zynga take / rake portion for sit and go's and cash games even if you're a winning player you lose your chips -> pointless. This along with the even worse than before fake predetermined scenarios sent out instead of actual real card distribution is the last straw. How often is it straight over 2 pair, flush over straight, full house over flush. Too many times to be possible in real cards! Fake! NOT random cards. Devs say that these predetermined scenarios are randomly handed out to players to get their crappy certification but it's not random cards and the fake set-ups just get more obvious and annoying the more you play and this aspect like other recent changes seems to have been also tweaked for the worse. I'm out. Used to be an ok experience but not anymore. Closed my account. I imagine that they are losing users in general. I don't miss it.",
            "Rubbish, a con, you play hands where you have the winning hand to be beaten on last card by a hand statistically your unlikely to get, I played over 200 hands with no winning hand. Its a game full of bots to then make you purchase chips, when you spend money on this game you lose more chips, it's a joke. Also when you make purchases you see there is say 5millionin the pot, you win it and only get credited 4.2million its not right at all. You only notice it on larger tables. This game is rigged t"

This release also brings with it performance improvements that will keep your experience running smoothly while you’re on the touchline.<br><br>Good luck in your upcoming matches, Managers!",
        "comments": [
            "Started off great, but then after few seasons the results don't make sense, does not matter how high your standard is, how highly trained you are you will lose to lesser teams after dominating play, The games have the same pattern, you will have lots of play, but you know from the start you will lose come what may..... it seems the lower you train the more successful you are?. The basic game play is good, but it is frustratingly fixed at times..",
            "Would be much better if it wasn't so random at times. Some variance is needed but sometimes you'll lose a game because it predetermines you too. Perfect morale and energy, +21% fans, team rating 30 above opponents, 77% possession, 19 shots to 7, but lose 1-0 despite you attending and making the every adjustment to try to score. Stuff like that happens.",
            "Much improvement since I last played over a year ago. Been playing on and off for five years. Great that you can still win without pay to win. Been able to win a lot and won a lot of trophy's. I've never payed a penny just watched the adds for the bonuses. I like the extra chances to win top players to keep or loan. At last the youth team is useful and get good players. Only small problem lower rated players are hard to transfer away than the past.",
            "Generally a good game but the algorithm is off when calculating results of games and yes, I've heard the arguments of good teams or good players can have off days or off seasons but sometimes it's ridiculous. You work hard, you train hard, you attend matches and you keep your team fully fit. You don't loose every major tournament to smaller teams and managers that never attend. Just doesn't happen, except here! Don't tell me to switch strategies, read forums etc. Fix the algorithm!",
            "I like this game,because you don't have to spend all day playing it,you just do your stuff for 20-30min in a day and done. I think is the best football manager game from now. Is hard until you build a good team but after with 2-3 good transfer/year you can keep a good team all the time."

            "I was looking for games in play store and then I found this game. I love dressing games and so I installed this game. I thought it won't be that good but it is. But many dresses and many backgrounds are locked. I wish there could be many dresses and many backgrounds. And I wish the barbies would say where they have to go. For example, they should go to a hospital. Then, according to it, I will dress them up. If you can, do like this. And the overall gameplay is good. Thanks for reading.",

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "Superb game I us the best game for time pass but please only little issue that we are not able to go into the building so please upgrade the game and make us to go inside the house, building etc it's a nice game I recommend this game to everyone. And one more advice try to make it into a multi player games to make it more interesting and amazing.",
            "Great game but the map should be more big and should have an airport and a Railway Station.Please add scope.The phone from which we can take selfies should have some more apps like the app from which we can order cars and please add some mini game like in the football field we can play it (penalty shootout) and same in the basketball court. Please add headlights to the cars and bikes so that it looks even better during the night time and please add weather change. The game is awesome.😊😊😊😊",
            "I love this game so much and I will play this game only but there's some problems 1. Add snow island and volcano island 2. If we touch a police car the police officer will come and shoot why he will not arrest me 3. To tri cycle in real life to buy is ₹3000 in this game you have given 21k 4. You should increase the speed of vehicles 5. Why there is no train in this game you should add train you have made an underground metro but not train. This the problem please update I am a kid. Thank you....",
            "Would definitely recommend, although I do have some ideas, 1. Animals should be added, like deer and pets, things to shoot, like the neighbors cat. 2. Useable stores, car dealership, weapons shop, etc. 3. I don't know the extent of what y'all can do but better AI would be sweet, like making friends with the NPCs, and more missions. Also, when I collect payment from a place I own, it won't let me collect from the other places, which is annoying. But thx for the great game!",
            "This game is very interesting . But 1 problem is that we cannot sit in robot cars . And we can go in buildings . And very powerful cars with missiles and powerful bicycle with guns. And new colorful helicopters with more power. And new powerful guns . And new pare shoot with more power . And animals like horses. And we can sit on animals .And new shirts and pants. And colorful aeroplanes with missiles. New knifes with more power. And also we can drink on coffee on coffee shop and eat burger"

            "Great game! It's definitely a puzzle game. It takes several tries to figure out how to beat each level. That's what I love about it! I paid the 2.99 to turn off the ads. Finally completed the last level. Took forever! Please add more levels! UPDATE: It's been a couple of months now since I finished the last level. Mind you, I don't know when the last level was actually completed by boom bit, but I keep getting updates for all of their games, but no new levels. Give us some new levels, man!",
            "The game is good, but very repetitive - just like the ads. You basically have to keep doing the same level over and over to earn enough coin to upgrade your car enough to pass that level. I paid to remove the ads as they were REALLY annoying. Even when you pay to remove the ads, you still get ads trying to get you to pay more money to unlock vehicles. I completed this game with the 2 cars that come by default within a few hours. Just waiting for new levels to be added. Not sure they will though.",
            "While my son I enjoyed playing the game, the ads can be a little bit ridiculous but I do understand it's a free game but still. I'm glad I didn't pay $299 for the no ads because there's not enough levels, with that said level 11 the vertical jump with the mountain yeah that can go to hell. I like a hard game but if I'm ready to throw the phone that's when I quit playing a game. only reason I will keep it is because my son likes playing it and he wants to unlock the rest of the free cars.",
            "Phenomenal Game but its very clear its unfinished. Level 11 is definitely meant to be a cash grab. Its 10 orders of magnitude more difficult than all the levels before it. Then level 12 is the final level. You can beat it over and over but the \"next level\" is always just the same level 12. Also, the ads are horrific!",
            "Heavy on ads, and level 11 designed to being in the revenue by being nearly impossible so you just watch a ton of ads or cough up the $$, but that doesn't solve how hard the level is. It also has some kind of memory leak that requires a hard close every so often. Otherwise it can generally be fun to play."

            "This is a good game but I have given it only one star because it has 1 ad. after a match and at times when the match begins. Multiple time the app suddenly stops working. I first thought that it can be due to my device's ram, which is 2GB but later I found out a friends device which has this same game and ram as 6GB, while he is also facing the same issue. Please fix this.....",
            "I like the game, it has good graphics.but the things u should work on is the controls, because it is weak,when hitting your opponent the wrestler already smack u down.and another thing is there should be a commentator, during the fight.it's a good game in gameplay, but need to be upgraded.and the wrestler's are not real, no real names,no undertaker,or Justina..so poor.☹️☹️",
            "This game is rigged, everything is working against you. I'm giving it a second star because I'm actually enjoying the game. The stats of the characters are actually useless, because someone you're more than by far can just do as he pleases with you and your moves. It would have been a very wonderful game if you didn't make it very unfair to the players. How can a ref count slowly for you and count fast for your opponent in a game? It's a rigged game, not challenging at all, just rigged.",
            "The best wrestling game on the market, and as a fellow game developer extremely well done for what it is, the actual controls have a bit of a learning curve but its amazing once you get them down. I had to buy the full game. Super excited for the new one boss. :) if you need a tester i would be honored.",
            "It was a nice and wonderful game, good graphics, almost real characters and credible moves but I rate this 4 stars because I think it wasn't totally perfect. May I suggest that you can set those attack here as a finisher or mid-air counter like superkick or bicycle kick. I think there's also a mistake in this game. How a gaunt wrestlers lift up a chubby and 7 ft tall opponent? Then if your opponent kick up to your pin, you can't get up emmidiately instead your opponent get up first than you."
