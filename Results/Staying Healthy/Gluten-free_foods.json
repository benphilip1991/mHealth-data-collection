            "Not sure what the people leaving 1-stars are talking about, this app works quite well. I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease (can't have gluten), so I'm glad this app exists. I tested it out on some products in my house, and what really impressed me is how lightning FAST it is when scanning and looking up products. Unfortunately there were some products that it didn't have in its database, but this app will certainly come in handy anyway. I hope the database is expanded in the future!",
            "Exactly what I need! I started scanning everything in my fridge and cabinets. The scanner is super fast and accurate. The few things that didn't show up, but most did. I am new to gluten free and this is perfect for me.",
            "I'm glad I only installed the free version. I'm new to avoiding gluten and very few of my foods I have in my house even show up. The suggested or related foods are always some expensive wholefoods brands. I just want an app that can tell me what foods I normally eat are safe and what I need to find alternative gluten free products for. Not very helpful.",
            "This app has been so very helpful when planning meals when my brother-in-law is in town. He has to have all gluten free foods, so I just check everything with this app to be sure he can have it. Don't want him getting sick on my watch !!! Would highly recommend it!! 466eee",
            "Seems to catch only sections of barcode and not the whole thing. It will scan, but miss the last part of the barcode and say that item is not in the database. Edit: thanks to the developer for a quick response! I will try more products"

            "This really is a great app. Especially if you are visiting an unknown location. I would give this 5 stars except for one thing: you charge for premium for content that is largely gathered by your customers. I understand the need for the income, but see no compensation for the contributers. I would like to see something like 'free short-term premium for X reviews/additions'.",
            "Awesome app. Have been using for years, and they have the most expansive reviews in even off the main road areas. Have used in other countries and was really helpful in our first trip to Barcelona. Travel in states we have used for first time trips - Chicago, Nashville, Kingsport, road trips between cities, Portland, Oregon Coast, Oahu just as examples.",
            "must have for anyone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. I'm not thrilled with the new \"premium\" features, but I spoke to the developer and understand why he implemented them. and there are a couple ways around using them, if you're cash-strapped like me and don't eat out enough to need them.",
            "It has definitely been useful in some countries, but not in others. Really needs a lot more input from users to be as helpful as possible. Frequently I have to add new places as there are no reviews - and the app fights you tooth and nail when you try to add places. But we will get there! And I would still say it is a \"must have\" for a traveling celiac.",
            "Every useful feature is now behind a pay wall. Used to have several features I've paid for off and on over the years, now there is absolutely no point to the free version of the app. And the price isn't worth it for questionable crowd sourced information that might be detrimental to your health."

But it has still a long way to go, many additives are missing, but keep up the good work {edit: OK, I will try to collect the missing additives} Also – for the information to be correct I strongly suggest that you include if the additive MAY BE WHEAT DERIVED. That way a user can make an informed decision. Many Celiac people are still too sensitive to have any additive that was wheat based – like mannitol, MSG, etc.",
            "good and useful app to test every code in the prodact, don't use it alone to conseder a prodact as safe",

            "Do you actually know what is contained in Gluten ? Or what it does. Alleviate the signs of autism and you for real ? Contains most types of grains ? Nope, 3! Wheat, barley and rye. A gluten free diet does not help weight loss and is unproven to the only time this is generally the case is down to the rest of a person's diet.

Unfortunately there aren't many dedicated gluten free kitchens but because of this app I was able to plan a getaway to have my safe birthday meals without having to spend so much time trying to read every location that comes up with the word gluten free. I still confirm with the that they are a dedicated kitchen before going, so far no issues. The map is a great feature.",
            "App has potential. At the present moment it does not locate anything at all, not even big cities like Philadelphia which have a ton of GF establishments and/or offerings. The first day I used it a few months back it introduced me to a bakery that was new too me. Aside from that, nothing! Hope you figure out how to remedy the glitches, best of luck!",
            "Location Services REQUIRED. Why can't I bypass that and input in a zip code or town and state? It's foolish to assume I want to find places where I currently am every time I open the app. You wait for the app to load and can't change the search location. So much for planning out restaurants before traveling.",
            "It is so wonderful to be able to find safe places to eat with this app! Richmond, VA doesn't have many options, but I now know of 3 new places that I had no clue about. This will definitely make my next traveling experience much much safer and less anxiety-ridden.",

            "Game-changer for me. I'm not a good cook and it's probably the only place I've found where ingredient quantities are just right in general (and expressed in metric units!). Also the instructions are easy to follow and timing fits well. I now eat more varied, grocery shopping is way easier and I waste less food.",
            "I am obsessed with this app! Here are the top reasons I love it: - It is so easy to use. - It is aesthetically pleasing. - It compiles a grocery list for you that you can add to. - The way that the recipe pages are laid out is GOLD. 👌 I don't have to scroll through a blog. I can click on three sections (utensils needed, ingredients needed, and instructions (with ingredients listed underneath so that I'm not having to click back and forth). - Etc.",
            "So far amazing. This is my first week using the app and I'm honestly just loving it. This app curbs my nasty habit of over shopping at the grocery store and yet still forgetting some essential items. I don't have to research recipes that fit into my Keto lifestyle, it's all layed out for me. Just click, and go. I'm honestly shocked at how easy it is to use and how incredibly helpful it is. This is not your turn of the mill list app or meal app. It's all here!",
            "Absolutely five stars. Easy interface, you add recipes to your plan and it automatically generates a categorized grocery list for you. Gone are the days of running around the grocery store grabbing useless stuff that goes to waste, and wasting money. I've been using this app for about 2 months and I'll never go back. I've been using the free version up until now, but I'm about to pay for the premium subscription because it truly is just that good. No, this is in no way an ad.",
            "This app has really helped me and my husband start to meal plan. I've tried to meal plan multiple times and just can't stick to it or it takes up too much time. Having the gluten free option definitely helps as well (celiac here) so thanks for including that! I've thought about going for the pro version but a yearly cost of about £50 is a bit much. I'd maybe consider a one off payment of that, or maybe if it was paying per meal bundle (since I'm assuming that's why it's a yearly payment)."

I was sad that I couldn't add anything but gluten to my allergies list on this app. Thus making this app useless for me. 🙍😔",
            "this app has great potential but it needs work on its user interface, navigation and food variety. I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",
            "Lactose free food search, there is a quite a good spread of foods in the database. There are some foods not covered by this app",
            "Limited food selection. For example, acorn squash not listed. Grey color coding not explained. Would not use as definitive guide. Last updated over 2 years ago.",
            "So easy to use and so many different types of food listed. My very favorite app to use for food sensitivities!"

A great thank you to the developers and please continue to expand the range of articles and continue to improve this app to be compatible with future IT development.",
            "The idea is very good. There are plenty of products reviewed. I love the recommended articles written by codecheck and the fact that they contain product recommendations. Minor bugs: - It may contain misleading information due to the fact that users can upload data about various products without those being certified by a mod. - The app is laggy from time to time - The user can upvote the same comment multiple times without the option to withdraw its vote if the button was mistakenly pressed.",

        "description": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, a mixture of proteins found in wheat and related grains, including barley, rye, oat, and all their species and hybrids (such as spelt, kamut, and triticale). Gluten is a composite of storage proteins termed prolamins.\r\n\r\nGluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value. A gluten-free diet should be mainly based on naturally gluten-free foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and maize are all appropriate components of such a diet.\r\n\r\nGluten Free recipes with photo offline don't require the Internet and your favorite recipes' application will always be with you, even when you haven't wi-fi.\r\n\r\nWe offer a lot of Gluten Free recipes. It is all in our recipes app for free download. \r\n\r\nTry to explore the variety of offline available Gluten Free recipes.

        "descriptionHTML": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, a mixture of proteins found in wheat and related grains, including barley, rye, oat, and all their species and hybrids (such as spelt, kamut, and triticale). Gluten is a composite of storage proteins termed prolamins.<br><br>Gluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value. A gluten-free diet should be mainly based on naturally gluten-free foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and maize are all appropriate components of such a diet.<br><br>Gluten Free recipes with photo offline don&#39;t require the Internet and your favorite recipes&#39; application will always be with you, even when you haven&#39;t wi-fi.<br><br>We offer a lot of Gluten Free recipes.

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

The wikipedia link they provided had no mention of the salicylate content of cranberries. It wasn't until I searched it further on reliable allergy sites that I came across it repeatedly marked as VHS. Very disappointed.",

            "Would be nice to filter only green/yellow+green categories and maybe save that filter. It would help to find out which type of foods aren't working for me and causing me issues. I think it's histamines but not sure yet.",
            "I'm glad I decided to spend a little bit of money to buy this app. The food database is very big, the filter options work great and the info is solid. The only places where I saw inconsistencies with other sources are actually current subjects of debate in the scientific community so it seems like the creators did a very good job compiling the info. The only slight beef I have with the app is that it's not very appealing to the eye but the simplicity of the UI is great!"

            "Opened database relies on people data feeds. Product addition requires 2 minutes with training. Above nutrition facts and labels, you get NOVA food classification (i.e. 4 processing levels defined by UN), vegan compliance and palm oil flags. You can build your product lists. You can review scanned products later (/ local logs). If you don't want to rely on advertising and don't have enough time to inspect packaging, you should try it.",

Because it's yeast that's dried with no additives, flavourings, colourings, added salt etc? I hope so any great source of B12 for vegans :)",

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

        "description": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is a diet that strictly excludes gluten, which is a mixture of proteins found in wheat (and all of its species and hybrids, such as spelt, kamut, and triticale), as well as barley, rye, and oats. The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial, and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten-containing cereals.\r\n\r\nGluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and wheat allergy.In these people, the gluten-free diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment, but several studies show that about 79% of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel, despite a strict gluten-free diet. This is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten.[10] People with poor basic education and understanding of gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a gluten-free diet may, in at least some cases, improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or HIV enteropathy, among others. Gluten-free diets have also been promoted as an alternative treatment of people with autism, but the current evidence for their efficacy in making any change in the symptoms of autism is limited and weak.\r\n\r\nGluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value, and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet. However, an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of gluten-free replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies. Replacing flour from wheat or other gluten-containing cereals with gluten-free flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients, such as iron and B vitamins. Some gluten-free commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their gluten-containing counterparts, and often have greater lipid/carbohydrate content. Children especially often over-consume these products, such as snacks and biscuits. Nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education.\r\n\r\nA gluten-free diet should be mainly based on naturally gluten-free foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients: meat, fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and corn are all appropriate components of such a diet.

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

            "App doesn't work well for allergens. Product can have \"processed in facility that also handles eggs\" and then app will say that the product contains eggs. Or if you scan a cereal and mentions calories with milk it then shows that the product contains milk. Actually continued using the app over the last few weeks and found it quite useful. Would give it 5 stars if it had a feature to denote the difference between containing vs processed in facility that handles x allergen product.",

            "I've had a great experience with this app! The food is delicious and easy to cook. I absolutely love the shopping list feature. One thing I would really like is for an actual breakdown of how many grams of food each person should eat. For example, it tells me that I should eat 44% of the food, but we usually use a bit more ingredients than the recipe calls for (ie., Using 2lbs of meat instead of 1.75 lbs). Having an actual weight for the nutrition breakdown would be immensely helpful.",
            "I like this app but it needs some work to make it more user friendly. Like once you make a dish from your weekly menu you should be able to check it off. I love the shopping list and pantry feature, but how about letting me add stuff to the shopping list so that I don't have to have two lists?",
            "So far I am super impressed I am on an elimination diet and suspected to be sensitive to garlic. I listed garlic and garlic salt as an ingredient to avoid. My first experience with the suggested meals at Whole Foods, the kielbasa and substitutes all had garlic salt. I had to put back the ingredients for that meal when I canceled it. I lost time but I also saved a lot of time with the shopping list feature, It's amazing! Please consider integrating with Lose it!",
            "The layout and concept of the meal plans is great. However I accidentally created a meal plan and it won't let me delete it. I can only create a new one but then the ingredients are based off the previous meal plan that was created by accident and I can't reset it. I would contact support but they don't offer in app support?",
            "this is a great plan, for me personally. love the recipes, qiuck, easy and oh ao tasty. I don't stick to it like the bible, but use it as a tool to fit my lifestyle and it helps keep me on track. I'm down a total of 25 lbs in a yr 1/2 . it's definitely a lifestyle change. I totally recommend! Thanks Christine and coaches!"

        "description": "The purpose of my app is simple: to better the lives of those living with celiac disease and anyone else who must eat gluten-free; to create a close-knit community where people in the gluten-free community come to discover, to learn, to share, and to connect, all to make their lives easier and healthier.\r\n\r\nLiving a 100% gluten-free life certainly has it challenges: physically, mentally and socially. Using the Gluten Dude app will help alleviate those challenges.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: EATING OUT SAFELY\r\nEating out is one of the more stressful parts of having celiac disease. One crumb is all it takes to set off the autoimmune response. Everything that is fun and spontaneous about eating out can be overshadowed by the anxiety of whether you can get through your meal unscathed.\r\n\r\nSolution: A directory of only 100% gluten-free restaurants, guaranteeing you a safe meal. Each restaurant includes images, a description, reviews, ratings, directions, etc. The app currently covers the US, Canada, Paris, Italy, London, Spain, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia, with more locations coming. \r\n\r\nNote: Recommended but Non-100% GF restaurants are now included on the app as well but are clearly delineated. These restaurants are personally vetted before being added to the app. NEW RESTAURANTS ADDED EVERY DAY!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: GETTING BAD/WRONG ADVICE\r\nThe internet is littered with falsehoods and dangerous information regarding celiac disease. People are looking for answers to their problems, quickly and accurately, and they are not sure where to turn or who to trust, putting their health in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nSolution: A forum where fear mongering and misinformation will be strongly discouraged. Varying opinions? Absolutely. But no \"McDonalds French Fries are gluten free\" kind of stuff. There are a number of topics where you’ll be able to chime in with questions, answers and advice. The forum includes Ask the Community, Ask Gluten Dude, Share Your Celiac Story, and more.\r\n\r\nYou also have access to videos from yours truly (Gluten Dude), where I answer reader emails, throw out some celiac rants and talk about the world of celiac disease.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: ISOLATION\r\nCeliac disease is a very misunderstood disease and can be quite isolating. I've received so many emails over the years from people whose own friends and family don't take their disease seriously; who don't get invited out to eat because they're \"too difficult\"; who are bullied at school simply because they can't eat gluten. And most of the time, there is no one there to turn to, to listen to you, to understand you.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION: Live chat. This app will connect you with others in the celiac/GF community, allowing one on one private chats. You’ll even have the option of providing your zip code, allowing people to search for others by location.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: FINDING GLUTEN-FREE BEER\r\nBeer, sadly, is not gluten-free. The most popular \"gluten-free\" beers on the market today are actually \"gluten-removed\" and are not safe to drink. There are a handful of amazing 100% gluten-free beers out there, but they can be difficult to find.\r\n\r\nSolution: The Gluten Dude app shows the stores, bars and restaurants where people can purchase gluten-free beer. The user will be able to search by any location and each location will show which specific gluten-free beers each establishment carries. Cheers!\r\n\r\nAND LASTLY...WHO THE HECK IS GLUTEN DUDE?\r\nMy real name is Scott but within the celiac and gluten-free communities, I'm known as Gluten Dude, a popular, passionate and outspoken celiac disease advocate. I was diagnosed with celiac disease in 2008 and I launched my blog in 2011. Here are a few kudos from my fellow celiacs:\r\n\r\n\"Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You changed the journey for me.\" - Joyful\r\n\r\n\"You make me smile, you make me cry, and you make me mad. But most of all, you make me grateful that I don’t have to figure this all out on my own.\" - Darlena\r\n\r\n\"Your latest post is why my son wants to be Gluten Dude when he grows up.\" - Denise",

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",
            "Paid premium, and didn't recieve. Sending questions and suggestions via email, and Facebook. No answer because they are closed on weekends. This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",
            "Really good set up, easy to use. I like it a lot. I can log any food ingredients that I eat, the time and date, my mood at the time, and any symptoms I get, and much more. A very good diary to log my food and drink intake.",
            "Once you've got your regular entries in its really quick to use. I like the range of options available. Mealtimes, exercise, mood, environment, sleep etc. Finding it really useful, plus I can send a report to my GP. 😊",
            "This is the best app I could have found to help me focus on my eating and health. I like the flexibility of being able to write notes for entries and to add symptoms. I highly recommend to others."

            "Best app I found for seeing if certain foods will aggravate my food sensitivities without having to scan every goddamned label and look everything up myself. Could stand to be fleshed out a bit more, but a great tool nonetheless.",
            "This is a very addictive sites to look at ingredients but no longer possible to use it on browser unless you just browse by the category only but good to look at nutrition fact.",
            "I began using this app when my doctor recommended I do the low fodmap diet for 6 weeks. I thought this would make shopping for specific foods a lot easier. Boy, was I wrong. It is not accurate when you scan items in the store. For example, I would scan items, and it would say to avoid this item because of a certain ingredient in it, like soy. I would then look at the ingredients on the product and nowhere would it be listed. I would not recommend this app.",
            "So far so good! My only suggestion would be to add a filter menu to searches / scanned items / lists, which provides options for sorting by food groups, brands, descending/ascending number rating, and excellent, good, poor, etc. matches only. As it is, looking through lists and searches is a nightmare when you have a LOT of items to look through. Another helpful feature would be to add an option to filter out duplicate items in searches--I once had a search give me 10+ dupes for several items.",
            "I was reluntant at first to try this app due to a lot of negative reviews and comments. I just found out some food allergies that is includes in lots of foods, such as wheat, and this app is a good help. It also helps with other ingredients you want to avoid, such as sugar, etc. It even shows you foods that will be good for you to choose that disclides everything, which is good for someone new to a bad allergy trying to find new foods to eat. So far, I love this app"

If my kids are feeling like seafood (yes, my kids love seafood!) I just simply type in \"shrimp\" or \"halibut\" or whatever seafood I have handy and look for a recipe that I can make that's Paleo and delicious. I'm excited to try the desserts out in m6 household and see what my kids think! This app is awesome. We love it! Yes!",

This won't be helpful for me and my family, so I uninstalled it.",
            "This app is a great concept but needs a larger database to be more useful. it's lacking several common things such as cereals, pastas etc. I scanned about about 20 things from my pantry but only got results on 5. Keep expanding the data set, this could be a wonderful tool.",

Thos app was created by a middle school atusent and doesn't work when you scan most products I scanned milk to test it and the app said I could have it. Before you scan anything the app asks for your allergies and I put Dairy and then is when I scanned the milk and it said I could have it. Over all this app is NOT a function app."

Wish they would get rid of the stupid tab that you can't get rid of on the phones notifications 3. That they had a thing where you can put what you have in stocks at home and give you recipes you can make with those ingredients",

            "The app keeps crashing. It closes suddenly. I thought it was because of my buggy old phone, but now I'm using another phone model and it works well but the app keeps closing. I asked my friends and they told me it also occurs with them. I can't even order. Plus the attendance is the worse. I lost one account because I lost my old phone and the number was gone as well, then I couldn't recover it, I asked for help and the support never came. iFood never did that to me.",
            "I pay for the monthly pass... And I am pissed off because it won't connect. And yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've turned my phone one and off.... I needed up using Doordash with no problems only it cost me more money because I don't have a pass there. I'd like my 10 bucks back at this point. Uber needs help and no matter who I email I never hear anything back.",
            "After half a year, the app didn't improve. Application is full of bugs. Even cannot register in the system. A Year ago it didn't accept my email address, half a year ago it did, but didn't show the keyboard for the first name/last name fields. Half a year later (oct 2020) still the same issue. Guys, how is it possible to create such a bad app? Shame",
            "Worst app. Doesn't even run properly. App tries to connect to server but can't. After half an hour finally connects and asks for address and looks for food and bang no response. Just the same screen with address option. Looks like it is searching for food in Mars that's why there is no food around me. And the same process repeat again and again.",
            "I can't get the app to open when on wifi. I have to take it off wifi on my android in order for it to work. Otherwise I get the same message \"try again\" and no matter how many times you click it , it won't open the app. I have a brand new S20 Ultra and it hasn't worked on my previous android wither."

            "I think it's great but I personal think you should would make a game called ultimate river simulator it would be very cool you could add playable animals like otters Beavers Muskrat Mink Bass And many more plus bosses 😁😀",
            "All of your games always glitches out and I payed for every single one of them, the fox 2 game i cant play the game for more than 20 seconds otherwise it's so laggy and glitchy there's just no playing the game at all,wolf 2 is the same way I'm on lvl 29 and i still can't defeat the wolf spirits at all not one of them...i can barely move the controls for each game kinda sucks, your character moves all over the place, you can try and turn the slightest and then your character will spin in a circle",
            "This game is pretty good the only thing I would change about it camera it's pretty wild and even if I press a locked camera it doesn't work as well as the other games other than that it's a pretty good game maybe you can make the graphics and it is Seal movement a bit better but that's all it's a pretty good game otherwise also in the old ultimate horse Simulator game with more of a pony than a horse just saying love the new ones and love the old one",
            "It was a good game my favorite YouTuber plays this game but the polar bear can't turn if you're on a phone it won't let you turn I tried over and over and over again and when I run I just like go to the grant and what if I just want to turn above the water and I can't.",
            "I like it but it's super glitchy for example the camera is very sensitive and the lynx when you release the mate it should be able to have one more cub since usually snow leopards and lynx and other animals like that are usually solitary with taking care of Cubs and the polar bear under water, when I clicked the running icon it just glitches the animal and can you please update the game so it can be easier to catch fish and please add new animal(s)? (And maybe make a Ultimate Wetland Simulator like someone said.) Sorry if this is to much, I really like the game but it needs some work. And on some animals it won't let you change the skin it says that you are using the skin you picked but your not so please fox it ;(! Ok and I also like how you guys added the Northern lights :3"

The desktop version can drag and drop if you want to easily arrange what meals you want on what day, but not on the app. Even though I have selected gluten free the recipes that still come up contain gluten, so i think a bug needsto be fixed. I love the community suppory and encouragement!",
            "Update: I understand that you can click on those three dots and move things around. But it is a pain in the rear end. Using the website is 100% better then using the app. ********* The app really doesn't work very well. I've used the Android version and the Apple version, and neither of them work as good as just using the site in your web browser. For starters you can't drag and drop your meals between the different days of the week. And that is a big fat bummer. And, in my mind a deal breaker.",
            "I'm always hesitant to pay for apps but I've got no regrets on this one. It's easy to use, customisable and the recipes are great with plenty of variety. I'd love to see the ability to filter by ingredient so I could easily find recipes that take advantage of what I've got growing in my garden or what's in season at the stores."

Download now and stay fit and healthy wherever you are! Well-known from Huffington Post, Paul McCartney’s Meat Free Monday and PETA. Find unique health- and sustainability-related information about every venue. Is it vegan? Is it local, fair-trade and organic, or raw, lactose- and gluten-free? vanilla bean offers the widest selection of US 🇺🇸, UK 🇬🇧, and German 🇩🇪 locations for anyone who eats consciously but does not want to miss out on anything.\r\n\r\nWhether you are in L.A., New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami or Washington D.C.—vanilla bean knows which places will make you happy: anything from gourmet venues to snack bars, from Chinese raw food temples in secret side alleys to this amazing Italian place where handmade gluten-free Bruschetta is soaked in olive oil.\r\n\r\nIf you are traveling in Austria 🇦🇹, Switzerland🇨🇭 or France 🇫🇷, vanilla bean has you covered, too. The guide includes cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, Zurich, London, and Paris.\r\n\r\nWith self-explanatory indicators for each venue, you can immediately spot what each location has to offer. The chosen photos and detailed descriptions, including reviews from the community, will help you decide which place to visit. Information such as addresses, opening times, and telephone numbers are constantly reviewed.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n★ NEW! Have you spotted a venue with plant-based options that is not yet in the app? You can suggest a new venue in less than 20 seconds. Thanks to automatic suggestions of places around you, sometimes you even don’t have to type a word.\r\n★ Filter according to your criteria and to price categories. For example, let vanilla bean show you only completely plant-based venues with gluten-free options using organic ingredients.\r\n★ Through the map, you can easily find all the green location highlights in your city. You can tell at first glance which places offer completely plant-based options, where one can find vegetarian options and where meat dishes are served.\r\n★ Your opinion, your personal experience counts: add your personal review and photos of the venue or the menu. If you like, you can share your newly discovered places with others on Facebook.\r\n★ Search for ZIP codes, places and specific locations, or discover venues with mouthwatering treats near you. \r\n★ You can find a wide range of information about all the entries. Photos, in-depth descriptions, restaurant indicators, directions, and calls directly from the app. In addition, you can find links to the restaurant’s website and Facebook page.\r\n★ All the information is regularly reviewed. Should you still find any obscurities, then please feel free to send us feedback directly via a restaurant’s app entry. We will make the adjustment as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nvanilla bean is an app for vegans, vegetarians, and everybody who wants to reduce meat. Whatever your motivation—health, climate change, compassion for animals—switching to plant-based meals is a healthier, more sustainable way of living. And with vanilla bean, it’s also easy and delish.\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK AND SUPPORT\r\n\r\nWould you like to support the release of vanilla bean in other countries or add more places? If so, send us a message at heroes@vanilla-bean.com. A service like vanilla bean would not be possible without the great work of our voluntary helpers. \r\n\r\nWe are constantly developing vanilla bean further. That is why we look forward to hearing from you. Nobody is perfect. However, we are working hard so that we can offer you the best possible service. You can get in touch with us directly at feedback@vanilla-bean.com. We try our best to respond to every message as expeditiously as possible. Have a great experience with vanilla bean! Make some chickens, pigs, and cows happy and enjoy your vegan meal!",

            "wonderful app for finding vegan places when I'm traveling, or even new places close to home that I didn't realize had vegan options. Some places maybe need to be updated but overall I found this app to be essential in any city that I'm not too familiar with. I recommend this app to others who travel.",
            "First time using this, I soon knew it was not well thought out. When I tapped map, it showed the ENTIRE COUNTRY of Spain instead of a window reasonably nearby. After zooming in, it showed only the currently pinned location with no easy way to scroll through others (they should learn from the Airbnb or HappyCow apps how this should be done). The list view didn't show distances -- who wants to tap each entry to find how far it is? The UI for filtering was a bit better than HappyCow.",
            "I'm currently in Switzerland and there is no filter for locations, e.g. if I'm looking for a restaurant in Zurich, places in Aarau show up which is useless. I expect to be shown options for where I am, not based on distance or whatever this is based on. Also it would be helpful if I could filter by cuisine. Unfortunately: good idea, poor execution. Better luck next time",
            "Has it improved!!?? It's a good idea,but this app Sucks when it comes to recognizing U.S.A city's &states,plus restaurants when u type them in.When u go to move the map to a city&state &tap th(Explore here).It expands far away to another 3-4 state area range. Away frm th spot u choose &tat u knw for a fact tat the venue's was approved &posted in your area of search tat this app ignores & when i type the restaurant! This app still,STILL needs MORE work!. I'm Deleting it after a month try !",
            "Easy to use, lots of options. As a gluten free vegan, it can be difficult to find restaurants that cater to both needs. I've discovered some great places through this app!"

Prior to the formation of the FODMAP concept, diet was seldom used as first line therapy for management of IBS, Crohn's, Colitis, Lactose intolerance and other FGID.\r\n\r\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms—including abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns without evidence of underlying damage.

            "Wow I love this app, except for the search feature. For some reason it cuts off the text? Like I type in \"turkey\" and press enter and the app only searches for \"turk\". Super weird! Also I thought the search feature would search all recipes, not just the ones I saved! Maybe that's not a feature, which is fine. However the text getting cut off appears to be a bug.",
            "Like it, but could be better. The overall function of the app is great, what really annoys me is the fact that you can only share the shopping list with your household, not the saved recipes or meal planner. We thought that this would help us avoid using Google keep, espc with all the automatic functions, but the lack of shareability is putting me off. If you're in a single household or your partner won't touch the kitchen, this is for you.",
            "This is by far my favorite meal planning app. I love the chrome extension so much. It's so easy to clip recipes from anywhere. To make it 5 star I would love 3 things: 1. To be able to write in the planner for days I dont have a recipe (\"out to eat\" \"leftovers\") so I dont think I forgot. 2. A nice looking full/half screen widget that shows me my weekly meal plan at a glance. 3. A pretty full/half screen shopping list. I LOVE the walmart grocery integration but I dont buy everything from there.",
            "Love it! It's user friendly and so helpful! I'm so glad apps like this one exist! Oh and its free! Absolutely love this! I love the fact that the ingredients have photos alongside, it really helps visual learners as 80% of people respond better to content where there isn't just plane text! I couldn't recommend this enough!",
            "This app does exactly what I've always wanted. It's clear the designers have looked all the other apps out there and pulled what worked into this one. Things I love: - Saving recipes from anywhere on the web instead of only from big subscription-based food network type websites (so yay independent bloggers!). - It accurately breaks down the ingredients list into an easy shopping list. - The meal planner is simple, but it appears to only allow for one meal a day, which is ok for someone who is just starting out, but may not be great for someone doing meal prep one day a week, such as Sundays. - That being said, the meal planner allows you to create a weekly shopping list, and check off anything you already have. - User flow is good, though I would prefer to set it my recipes as my landing page. - Not sure what to do with the communities yet, but I'm not a super social person, so this is a non-issue for me. - Would be interested in buying this app to unlock more features in the future and to prevent ads being used on it."

The farms on this are way smaller, hardly any animals on them, and are just sad little farms. The map I did not think was as impressive as it could be either.",

            "Great game! Probably the best dog simulator i have ever played. And, everyone who is asking how to become a tame dog, there is a home location that is a house. Edit: I saw someone saying that dogs don't unlock till past the lvl they say. I wanted to explain this isn't a glitch, they simply accidentally set the said lvls to not the real lvls they unlock at.",
            "It's a awesome game. But when the dog catcher captures you need to take us to the shelter or pound and either escape or get adopted. I also dont like the way that the door stays open it should open and shut like the Ultimate Cat Simulater game. You should make a second one of these.",
            "I loved these types of games when I was younger. It's good to know that you're also still making games. There's many simulators of animals from different people on the play store but most of them aren't too good. It's pretty nice to know that there's a huge variety of these as well. Thanks for these types of games",
            "I loooooooove it. But the dog catcher could do more, in stead of staying in one place, he could drive around looking for dogs. He could also have a shelter for dogs that he catches. Other wise it's great. Also can there be a doberman pincher and greyhound?",
            "This is an amazing game and absolutely love it, but I'm having a bit of trouble adding another dog intoy pack. I tried reading the direction, but it's still not working. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. If you could example step by step that would be a big help."

            "I love this game! Especially how there are wildfires sometimes. And, to the person who asked for a house cat game, go look for Ultimate Cat Simulator. They don't have to make your suggestion game because they already did before you commented that.",
            "Its a game good game but its not worth the money. But I enjoy it, theres alot of things to do, bosses are fun and challenging, and its somewhat realistic. But on the other hand, glitches here and there, weird models that might become disjointed, and it takes so long to unlock the animals in this game. Overall, its pretty good. I should rate it higher, but so many glitchy things about the game that have not been fixed.",
            "Ok love it but di u guys think u can add 1 2 or 3 more animals like playable ostriches and wielder beast cause those the 2 animals i really wnna play as u can make them available only to lvls 70 or 80 or between that cause i realy do wanna plays as those 2 animals i also appreciate u guys for this game u have no idea how much.",
            "Hear me out: MULTIPLAYER!!! Also, can you make it to where we can actually SNEAK on the prey, instead of them running off when we get ten strides from them? Also, for non-predator animals, make them giant patches of grass so that we don't have to go from bush to bush. Make the wildfire a real, destructive threat. Make the animals harder to defeat, and make finding mate hard. Make finding food harder. Make these games a challenge like it really is out in the real world.",
            "great but could you make it to where when you play as the hippo and try to swim faster you don't flip out and have the rhino not drown as soon it hits the water? not trying to sound to finicky this is my favorite game and could you maybe add the wild dog as a playable animal or maybe do a game where it's by itself? that would be great"

Whenever I switch to my last played cat, it spawns at the water of the beach and its hard to run all the way back with losing energy repeatedly. I've read the replies of people and they've said the same. But other than that, this is an amazing and fun simulator of a wild, or owned cat. I will rate it 5 stars as soon as the glitch is fixed.",

I switch to them and switch to the last played character, and he/she appears at the beach. If I switch to the other characters, they spawn all over the map. Plz fix it!",
            "This game is awesome but my mate spawns all over the place! And once I went to change my cat and I spawned at the beach I was disappointed when I figured that out please fix this and i'll change my review.",
            "There are so many problems with this game One: every time I respond my mate would spown somewhere random in the world Two: if I switch to my mate I spown some were and my mate despowns Three: my mate wonders off and doesn't fallow me It makes me so mad",
            "It was in okay game, but the only thing was that if I had it had a family member if we're to vanish and would just run off somewhere!! Can you please fix the game a little bit cuz this kind of glitchy actually, also can you please make it where there the human walks around and also can you at least be a level 10 to have a kitten!"

Also the flying animals dont fly. They glide on the ground or under the ground. Whenever I attack an animal, like a cougar, a turtle or a different species will join it...",

            "This is the best game ever i love how the walk or fly is realistic and the roaring get this game now i almost have all of your games i need 1 more witch is ultimate farm simulator but this is the thing i dont like about some of your games is that when you walk into the bushes it glitches and this has happend to me alot but anyways i love ur games oh and please make an Ice Age simulator??????"

            "i just got the game a few days ago and im addicted to it! however there's some really annoying bugs that make the game difficult to play. when my trust stats are way up, they go back down to 10% or less, or it doesn't go up at all even when me and my mate win a battle. another thing is that sometimes after winning a battle, my wolf is still stuck in \"combat mode\" and it's stuck like that unless i reload the game. other than that i love the game! compared to other wolf sims this one's the best",
            "Not as amazing, but does remind me a bit of WolfQuest, my all time favorite animal sim! But there are problems like LAG. Graphics on lowest still lag. The camera turns away from food making eating hard, especially on locked. The music is boring, so I just play WolfQuest's. Please fix the lag and camera. Edit: Well, WolfQuest is still the best Wolf Simulator you'll EVER find (especially Anniversary Edition :D)!! This one, on the other hand, doesn't even let you have pups. Disappointing...",
            "The graffics are really good and it's a super fun game, but there is a bug in the game. I can't breed my wolf's for some reason whenever I click on the wolf's to breed them they don't show up on the breeding page, which is really disappointing because I'd like to have pups in my pack. If you can fix this issue I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate it. Thanks.",
            "Game is wonderful with beautiful graphics, There are some things I'd like for you guys to tweak. 1. (The Boss battles)While fighting a boss, when you dodge the boss hits you anyway 2. (Supplies) It sometimes gets annoying when you run out of supplies like sticks or rocks, could you atleast add a new feature called : \"Scratch\" and you could scratch the fallen logs to obtain sticks. 3. (Stunning) To be able to Stun your opponent would make the game a lot easier for new people",
            "Great game, but way too glitchy. For example, I'm trying to get out of lava and it keeps turning me around so I'm going into the lava. It freezes and that makes doing stuff hard. The glitching and freezing are my main problems. Other than that, the game is really cool. The animals are quite realistic and the scenery is amazing."

            "Even if you're allergic to meals, they'll still be recommended up top. There should be a way to hide meals w/ nuts, for example, cuz over 1/2 meals now have nuts for no reason (especially the new meals). Also, the app's unintuitive, & it's a nightmare to add/browse/change meals. The food's usually fine if you do oven instead of microwave, but the app's terrible. EDIT: Ya, you can enter an allergy, which I did. That doesn't DO anything. At all. It should. That's what's wrong. We can't hide meals.",
            "The meals arrive on the day you specify. The food is very good. No prep, just 2-3 minutes in the microwave. The app makes reviewing available meals & changing type or quantity of meals very easy. On the phone, customer support folks are great, too. I had to downsize the number of meals, because it was just too much food for me, but everything else is great.",
            "This app is so easy to use and asks you if you're sure you want to do something like exit suddenly which would lose the work you've done. I like apps that check before letting me make a mistake. Since the pandemic hit, I have been reluctant to go grocery shopping. Freshly gets me healthy fresh food without the contact and exposure. The portion sizes are perfect for me. And the meals are so delicious and satisfying.",
            "Great service.. though I wish it was a little cheaper or had some discounts or coupons. I know some similar services provide a military/veteran discount rate. Overall, meals are pretty good except the steak and the collard greens. Also, the meals with chopped/pre-cut meat tend to be much better than the dishes with whole pieces of meat, like chicken breast or steak. Not sure why, might just be me. 🙂",
            "I am very pleased with the options provided and I love that I don't have to cook as much! Let's face it, less cooking means less dishes too! I do wish there was a veteran's discount though. My husband and I have enjoyed trying new foods we wouldn't have normally tried before. We look forward to new meals in the future. For now, my favorite meal is the sausage baked penne!"

Además la ficha de cada restaurante incluye imágenes sobre los platos más representativos del establecimiento y permite a los usuarios registrados (registro gratuito), valorar y comentar sobre su experiencia en el restaurante. \r\n\r\nUna de las funcionalidades más útiles de la App es que realiza búsquedas en función de la ubicación del usuario, así podrá saber qué opciones sin gluten tiene más cerca de donde se encuentra.

Trying to do a web search with these variables is mostly useless, especially for desserts. I have an intolerance to bananas and most sugar-free desserts include bananas for some unknown reason. Your filtering is not flawless, but more useful than the web. Great for now, but consider multi- condition filters down the road.",
            "For +6 months, the titles for the banner images on the home screen of the app are cut in half horizontally by the banner images under them. You can figure out that the words under a picture say (e.g.) \"50 Seafood Pastas You'll Love\" maybe 40% of the time? Also, can't tap on users in the Reviews section + go to their profile + see their submissions? The 'back' button on a related recipe should take you to the original recipe you opened NOT skip back to the home screen! Argh! Otherwise nifty app",

I tried creating a simple recipe using fresh ingredients and whenever I did a search, the only items that came up were processed foods or none at all.

This is not an issue with any random valet for his connectivity issues. The problem persists for all orders. Valet doesn't move at all on the map at times. The issue persists even after latest update. 2) Even after the order is delivered, at the bottom of the main screen, it is displayed as Food is being prepared.",
            "Great app. Lots of filters for ease of use. New update for one star on 30/10/2020. Pathetic approach. I ordered the food. Restaurant was ready with food, but no rider was allocated for an hour. Finally when I contacted customer care, they said sorry and added a credit amount for their mistake. I paid for service, not to get the credit. Finally, the restaurant itself arranged their own driver and sent the food and was never sent by Zomato. Regret to be a Zomato Pro member.",
            "The new UI revamp is refreshing. The notifications and chats are handled well. The payment page fragment design can be improved. One can easily miss the promo section, if its not intentional. I would expect orders to be shown by default than favourites in the orders tab. The order tracking banner is well designed as well. Kudos to the designer.",

The menu is not visible to me and it is showing that I can order.

I am very passionate about Cupcakes, Teas and Working with Kids!\r\n\r\nI came up with this idea of using organic ingredients for all my recipes and donating 50% of the profits to kids charities in San Antonio. \r\n\r\nI take pride in my creations and we have highly rated reviews on Google: https://bit.ly/AkkiGoogle for our Regular, Vegan, Keto and Gluten-Free Options for Cakes & Cupcakes in San Antonio\r\n\r\nEVERYTHING IS MADE FRESH TO ORDER!

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",
            "Found this app really disappointing. The high/low fodmap scoring is behind a paywall. Additionally I lost confidence in the food directory, hardly any of the meals I get from the supermarket are in the directory.",
            "User experience is just really cluttered. I looked for my regular low fodmap items in the meal directory and could not find any of them. Going to keep looking for a helpful fodmap food diary",

It is a type of Italian food typically made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour (semolina) mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.\r\n\r\nPasta is divided into two broad categories, dried and fresh. Both of them come in a number of shapes and varieties. It is classically served in mainly three types of prepared dishes. Cooked pasta is plated and served with a complimentary side sauce or condiment. The second classification is in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven. Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color, and texture. In terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but these generally have low micro nutrient content.

There are a variety of ways to shape the sheets of pasta depending on the type required. The most popular types include penne, spaghetti, and macaroni.

            "This app is so buggy. It sometimes has trouble pairing with my sensor even after following the instructions and troubleshooting section and I can't leave restaurant reports (error of \"something went wrong\"--I've tried so many times and it's really frustrating to take the time to write a review on my phone and have it wiped). That was the main selling point for me--a database of collected public tests and it doesn't work.",
            "First time I paired the app it prompted me to update firmware. I updated chose to update the firmware and and the app failed as it was updating. The nima device is now unresponsive. I was originally having issues wirh test capsules providing no results. Inlove it when it works, but have had nothing but problems. Hopefully support gets back to me and assists with both issues.",
            "Lack of support in pairing this application to my phone. Support is lackluster in helping me pair my Nima to my phone, help has been greater than 7 days with only one response. The app writer needs to expand the Bluetooth pairing to other phones on Android",
            "The device is great, but the app is seriously lacking. I would really like to be able to see other folk's Nima test results as advertised, but that functionality has never worked properly for me.",
            "The app doesn't let me enter the information for the tests performed. I have contacted tech support, they know it is a problem, but it has been a problem for many months."

            "Wow!! This is literally the best stimulator game available on Google play. Only suggestions maybe the pack could include more dogs (8-10 maybe?) and you could breed them and have puppies. Also maybe you could name them and select gender? Overall, if you're looking for a good quality game, this one is definitely worth the price!!!",
            "Alright, the game may look fun, but everything about it is bad. The graphics are terrible! The dogs don't even look like dogs, they look like distorded aliens of some sort that run on four legs. The buildings just look like pictures pasted onto the model. The dog runs way too fast, so it looks like you're Sonic the hedgehog. I wouldn't recommend this game. It's a waste of time and money. Wildcraft is WAY much better than this, and it's free, with better graphics than this garbage.",
            "I love this game, but I would like it if u made it so some of the humans on the game are just merciful enough to adopt u, and bring u to their house. Make it so u can have a dog bed (I also want to be able to choose the color of it), a food dish, (the humans put certain types of food in it), make it so dog toys, bones, and treats appear. Make it so u can have a collar, and leash so ur owner can walk u. (I want to choose the color of it, and also make a spiked black collar.",
            "I Hate it Because I like it But why the Other Dogs Be Friends when They Touch Each Other and The Dogs Bite Really Fast and I bite slowly and they Bite Really Fast Not cool But I still like its Awesome! And Cool But Please all of your Games is Fast Biting Everything in Those all Games are Fast. Biting😭😭😭😭😭 and I still like all of your Games Awesome!!!!!Thank you I still give it a 5 Stars and Even Cats Kill me Faster Than I Thought",
            "I really like this game! It's really fun. I just have one complaint: how come the dogs all led like boy dogs? What if I want to be a girl dog?"

I was overcharged on one of their Gem packages, I emailed them with my issue and it's been a very frustrating trying to get my refunded compensation!!! I still have yet to have my issue solved!!!!",
            "Reverse the upgrade, it's a total mess. There's no good way to earn grams anymore. The food truck that used to give up to 6gems every 4 hours has been removed, I need that truck back. Getting gems is not easy and the amount of gems required for upgrade is always too high. Also remove that cray cruse ship and replace it with the truck that gives gems. It takes too long to get gems. This is wickedness haba!!",

That means all of my HARD EARNED GEMS r down the drain. I don't wanna uninstall this game but..... talking about you squashed a few bugs....squash that one.😶"

            "First thing I noticed is this Diabetic Recipe App is not a Vegetarian App. Developers who call a Vegan App a Diabetic App are deceptive. This app has many recipes that you can actually enjoy while watching carbs, sugars and diet! It is the individual who is responsible for making sure they do the proper proportions and leave out what every they know they had enough of that day. I really do appreciate seeing recipes we can actually use!!!",
            "Very informative and helpful for diabetics. Thank you for this most important app.",
            "Recipes look good and particularly easy. No search option, the carbs and sugar are broken down per serving and how many servings but nothing about serving size. I an app to more efficient. Im already weighing everything and trying to read/follow recipe. If you could also use American terms and/or have American measurements would be helpful. (Not everyone know that an aubergine is an eggplant for example)",

            "Works great. Takes a bit of time to learn to navigate the app. Surprised at the number of vegan recipes available. Some food were incorrectly inputted so I sent a report and also updated what I have. I wish you could update the info yourself. Also, I wish there was more flexibility with the intermitten fasting time. Overall, happy and hopeful it will help me achieve my weight loss goal.",
            "I've been using this app for quite a few years and it is pretty decent. However, I was quite disappointed that the search option for one's own foods was removed; now one has to scroll endlessly until they find the food they are looking for. Furthermore, I would suggest adding a meal prep feature where one inputs the nutrition details for what one eats, but then the actual calories and stuff is only added to the daily counter once it has been eaten(a check off system).",
            "I really love how many options of food there are, I can always find the exact thing I've eaten on here and how much I had. The only thing I don't really like is the feature connecting the app with a step counter app like Google fit, it doesn't really seem to work properly and update my steps so I've started just adding them in manually. Aside from that it does all I need.",
            "When you search food it doesn't have as many options as I would like, such as restaurants. It might have one calorie count for something and the one below it is completely different. It's hard to know what's right or wrong. You can add them in but I don't want to do that every time so I feel like I am guessing. I wish it would have things set as peice or amount. It reminds you frequently to log info and encourages you which I like, and has a lot of meal options. The meal calorie count is nice.",
            "I'm using it to track my dietary supplements, it's pretty straight forward, and you can add your own foods (like your mom's recipe and stuff). I wish I could be more precise with the measurements (Adding Vitamin D in milligrams is pretty useless, for example) and that it accepted more nutrients (my supplement has a ton of vitamins and minerals, and it would be nice to track those. I wish I knew an app that could approximately the micronutrients content of my mom's recipe too...)"

            "completely restaurant focused app. The developers have developed this one in order to maximize their revenue from restaurants. you cannot search by using filters, you cannot narrow down your searches, it's always the same restaurants appears whether you select pizza or burgers, which means restaurants can choose whatever they want. if there were Alternatives I would definitely use alternatives.",
            "Can't connect to card: 400 Bad request. Copied everything right. Email confirmed. Card was previously used for similar apps. (DinaCard) Dissapointment. Also strange design decision when you want to order two of the same thing. No filters!!! Probably problem with accounts and different phones. Looks nice for ~~2 minutes. I want my account deleted because the app doesn't let you delete your account.",
            "Excellent restaurant choice plus order together function. I've discovered several really amazing places on wolt according to the rating system that I'd never visit just while being in the city. As well there's a nice order together function when all your friends can take what do they want on their own devices, when all are ready the order is submitted to the restaurant and delivered together. And the app just looks nice, bright and simple.",
            "Updating my original review to 5 stars. I had an issue at first with the app not accepting any payment cards. Submitted a ticket to customer service and they responded very quickly with steps to fix this. App works great now. Good UI, fast delivery, and solid customer service.",
            "The Wolt app is great, it is my favorite one for ordering food. It has a large portfolio of restaurants available and the app has all the functionalities you need. Also, it looks nice. I have to mention the customer support because it is awesome, above all expectations. They solve everything very quickly and with care."

The order is still in my cart, this is very misleading. After my 1st and 2nd orders I learnt about this, so it's fine for me, but to new users this is very annoying. Anyway, this app provide good service and I appreciate it.",
            "I have ordered many times via this app. It will work...IF YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK. Like today, I tried 7 or 8 times trying to PAY but I just couldn't pay. I am paying by credit card. I got to the screen and got the OTP and then I entered the OTP and then.... NOTHING. Waited for so long until the system tells me \"TIME OUT\". Seven or eight times trying. Giving up for today. Maybe try again tomorrow or maybe not at all. One more thing. If I somehow do receive the 8 orders, I will uninstall the app",
            "The app is good, but it needs more adjustments, like the \"add to cart\" button and the \"place order\" button. I think it would be better if both buttons is in different position, because what if that customer of yours has accidentally double clicking the \"add to cart\" button, simply it will directly to \"place order\" button. and it doesn't have cancellation of order, you must add \"cancel\" button. And it would be nice if you add this app \"checking order\" before the order place it. Please notice.",
            "This app definitely need to improve. I am regular user. The rider and food list all has no bad experience. HOWEVER! I most frustrated is to find LIVE support help. When I need urgent help I cannot find anything. FAQ no answer. When click \"not answered\" it goes bacK HELP CENTER. It goes merry go round. I spent close to 1 hour and yet I cannot find. So I gave up. I have clicked on all available function. WHERE IS YOUR LIVE CHAT OR TEL CONTACTS!!!!",
            "Its great to order on cash on delivery but the ordering system needs more inproving and the gps as well. I constantly refresh just to see where my delivery guy is at. It's not a real time tracking monitor. And for ordering wanna get to see the pictures of the menu not just the words. Like i wanna see what i'm buying. But over all food panda is a good app."

I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or \"extra features\" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",
            "Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!",
            "This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",
            "I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",

I have already sent an email to the developer but I didn't get the response! I'm waiting for your reply as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and support.

            "Great app! Was super impressed when I reached out and had several emails back and forth. This app was perfect for me because it took all the mental work out of getting healthy. Deciding on a workout routine was intimidating. Eating healthy even more so. Even if I wasn't pairing with a workout, deciding what to eat has always been difficult for me and often resulted in a lot of food waste. Not anymore! I am learning how to cook so much and my diet is tastier than ever actually!",
            "Awesome. This app has everything I need. I can track my weight, meal plan, schedule workouts...and it has stats galore. There is lots of flexibility in the setup, so I can schedule a cheat day each week into my plan. There are plenty of recipes to use, and if you go off-plan you can add things manually. There are loads of features. It's exactly what I was looking for.",
            "App is pretty good, has a lot of features and if you're willing to pay it offers a lot more. I highly recommend his, but 2 stars for the following reasons: the weight doesn't increase weekly by default (at least on the PHAT routine), and it doesn't have T bar or Hex bar as options when substituting for others. Add t bar and hex bar and I'll increase my rating Edit: dev responded and made clarity to all my issues. Highly recommend it",
            "Great structure! I love how much I can customize! There are a variety of options for popular workout routines. Within that I can select my rest days, and choose from a huge database of movements based on my equipment available. By following the routine it is helpful in selection of weight and keeping me on task with appropriate rest time between sets. I want to explore the nutrition/meal component more. It is so cool to have everything in one place. Thank you!",
            "This has been exactly what I've been looking for. The ability to pick from a variety of workout plans, set different goals, meal planner, and the grocery list all in one has been easy to use and makes everything easier and faster for me. A couple things: the food search gets glitchy and there's a delay, and maybe the addition of vegan or no-dairy diet restrictions. Also, am I able to update the days I can work out and the length of time, mid week/routine? Love this app!"

Peel uses OCR technology and therefore allows you to directly scan and analyse ingredients on any food label, restaurant menu, or recipe.

If you only have 20 rubies now you have to buy more my grandchildren don't have enough allowance to spend on buying more rubies come on guys think about that because now they need an adult to spend a lot of money on a game.",
            "The statement \" We create levels different in complexity to make the game more interesting and exciting. All levels are tested manually and possible to pass. Boosters and other extra materials of the game you can get in daily gift or buy in store.\" is BS! Who is testing these games? The time levels especially the ice cream levels takes so many tries to beat. The time shouldn't start until the people order shows. The coins should be used for boosters or gems. Addictive but NOT WORTH IT!",
            "This started off very well. But then it was frustrating as the booster were impossible to get and the upgrades were way to expensive. I just wanted to play a game where you do not have to pay to get stuff. This is just not right.",
            "Levels are hard to pass without boosts or added time too soon...they want you to spend money ... just like most of these free cooking games. I enjoy the game and the graphics but I don't enjoy it enough to spend money on it.... time to find a new game again.",
            "This game is insane. I make the food and it wont let me click it to serve it to the customer. Im on level 250 or something. And this just started. Its very frustrating. Very disappointed because i enjoyed this game. Ige checked for updates and have even deleted and re downloaded the game. Still wont work properly."

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

            "I use this app a lot! Especially with the pandemic going on I want to make sure I'm utilizing everything I have in the kitchen to the fullest extent. Having everything laid out in the pantry section makes it super easy to get cooking inspiration. The shopping list function is also really helpful. The recipe search function is great and makes things very clear. I feel so much more organized in the kitchen now that I'm using this app!",
            "I like it so far. However, there are a few issues. There is no way to know if you have 0 of an item unless you click on it. It would be nice to have a way to mass add anything that has a 0 quantity to the shopping list. Also it does not appear that you can delete or rename categories you created. Can you please add these features?",
            "The meal planning is on point. You can easily add recipes you find online, although they aren't very customizable. Grocery list is great but pantry creates all sorts of duplicates. Great features and easy to use but does need improvement.",
            "So far it's been great, it feels more user friendly than some of the other similar apps I've used. I love the pantry idea, I just have to take the time to actually input it all",
            "I'm still getting used to everything; but overall, I really like the app! I can plan meals that I find within the app or import recipes from online OR enter my own. It keeps a log of what's in your pantry and helps you keep track of what may be expiring and what you will need from the store, (just make sure you check off whether you've made the recipe or not). I haven't used all the features yet, but overall my meal planning has gone to another level."

            "After a while, the barcode scanning functionality (and certain other features) gets hidden behind a paywall. You need to use WiFi to access your shopping list in a grocery store. It doesn't save your sorting method between sessions. If you just want to delete an item, it still gets added to your shopping list and you'll need to delete it there, too.",
            "So far so good, though I'm concerned by the comments about a paywall... I am putting the effort in to load my pantry info and allowing them to use the info, I hope I don't get paywall blocked halfway through...",
            "This app is okay and kind of fun. But I have two pet peeves. So far I haven't figured out a way to add my own categories. For instance, I would like a separate category just for baking. Also it doesn't group things together by item. what I mean is I have four cans of black beans. Because they're all four different brands. They are located in four different places. so instead of saying that I have four cans of black beans, it says I have one of this brand, one of that brand, etc etc.",
            "The closest pantry app 2 what I've designed in my head 2 meet my needs but could not execute since I'm not a programmer. Barcode scanner is best part! I agree w/some other reviews about crashing, grouping items like corn together rather than having each brand listed separately. There are some logistical issues I'd like to see improved & I'll email developers bcz app is useful enough 2 me that I paid $12 for a year of premium & I feel the developers want to keep improving the app, & will. :-)",
            "I'd been looking for the perfect kitchen organizer app for years. Kitchenpal isn't perfect, but it's the closest one I've found and has the most potential. I love the automatically adding low items to my shopping list & the expitation date warnings. You'll spend a couple of hours getting your food scanned into the app, but it is worth the effort. Not everything you scan is in the database, but it's also easier than most apps to add or modify items."

It is a good app and has some great recipes, but I am a little disappointed that not all the recipes from the book are in it.. I had actually expected it would have more that had been created after the book being published. A few of the sections also don't work, such as where you tell it what ingredients you have and it tells you what recipes you can make.",
            "I'm having a few issues with the app. I bought the smoothie bowl recipes and for a while now I can't view them because the app is asking me to purchase it again. When I first got the app, I could view the seasonal challenge recipes which was my favorite part of the app. Now the app is asking me to purchase 20+ recipes for each season before I can see the in app recipes. I don't want to buy the other recipes. I have emailed them about this a few days ago and I haven't gotten a response yet.",
            "It's a beautiful app that doesn't work correctly and is killing my battery. The app crashes with every use and it stays on in the background. No good. I'm having to force a shut down or keep my phone on a charger. I don't suggest purchasing the app until it's repaired. The company should be offering returns at this point.",
            "It has been 30 minutes since I purchased this app, still I cannot even dowload it. It keeps on downloading process. Very dissapointed. I am clicking on refund button at present. Thanks to process the refund."

            "Many clutches, designed to have lots of control over the users profiles, i.e. they can switch off the benefits of applied discount for using specific credit cards no matter what you do removing and adding cards, they can switch off your default saved address to keep asking to provide the same while checking out.- by checking other similar apps noticed also the price of the same exact item from the same restaurant is always much higher. Extremely annoying! Already wrote customer service no luck!",
            "The only thing I wish is for the change language to be there for any page. Sometimes while you're navigating you want to search a specific plate name or even the resturant name in another language, you have to give up your current state and go back to the home page, the settings menu to change the language. Where a simple language choice button at the top would have sufficed",
            "Excellent Service. Great app. User friendly. So far no issues ordering medicines, groceries, fast food. Fast and efficient!!! Please add more food chains like Vietnamese restaurant in Bur Dubai, Pak Lyari Restuarant in Deira and Bur Dubai, Ravi in Deira. Thanks",
            "Froad app. Please don't install. I am not able to login. Then i reset the password using forgot password option. Still it is saying password mismatch. I contacted the customer support and they said they can't do anything. I have billed 2000 rupees for nothing. I am not even able to use the app. The worst ever teams i have ever seen.",
            "Pathetic customer service, UX and UI. I used the chat option and 6 agents changed automatically in less than a minute. Every time I start typing and a new agent appeared. Credit card offers don't mention the minimum amount of spend required. When you type in CC Number, it shows discount will be applicable but I get charged full amount. It is like you getting cheated but can't do anything. Customer service can't do anything as in their interface it shows minimum amount spend requirement."

Very accurate recipes, and premium is cheaper than the average price of a cup of coffee. Definitely going to continue using it for a while! ❤✨",
            "Before even seeing the main screen, I got 3 ads popping. I get that you need to make money out of your app and it's fine, but I still want to be able to use the app before being bombarded by ads.",
            "I really like this app because not only can you cook tatsy Japanese cuisine but you also can change the language to Japanese and study recipes in Japanese. It's really good practice. Plus it's easy to use.",
            "Pretty nice app for a collection of YouTube videos for the recipes",

        "description": "Your dog is a member of the family and you want him to eat just as well and healthily as you do. Don't make the mistake of assuming you can just feed your dog whatever you're eating, though. Dogs have different nutritional needs than people, so you'll need to understand what makes a balanced diet for your pet. Once you understand that nutritional balance, start making and feeding your dog delicious home-cooked meals.\r\n\r\nIt includes vegetarian, gluten-free and special occasion dog food recipes, BARF diet advice, general dog health and nutritional considerations, including what you should never feed your dog to keep it happy and healthy. \r\n\r\nCheck out the recipes for diabetic dogs, dogs with heart conditions, food sensitivities and allergies, and learn how to make tasty dog biscuits, stews, fishcakes, cinnamon apple crisps, dehydrated food, christmas and thanksgiving dog food recipes, and many more recipes your dog will absolutely love. This book will even show you how to make natural shampoo and conditioner for your best pal.\r\n\r\nWritten by a chef and dog-lover, the \"Beg Worthy\" recipes in this cookbook will have them beggin' for more!\r\n\r\nEvery good dog deserves to be spoiled. This book goes out to all the loyal companions out there that give so much but don't expect much in return - only love, and hopefully, some tasty food! - Charlie Fox\r\n\r\nUnderstand the difference between the diet of your dog and a dog in the wild. Yes, wolves or wild dogs can survive in the wild without balanced meals. But, their average lifespan is considerably shorter. They also eat very differently than your dog is used to. While you might feed your dog pure protein, dogs in the wild eat organs like kidney, liver, brain, and the contents of the guts. This makes for a more complex nutrition than simply feeding meat (protein) and rice (carbohydrate) from the store.\r\nIf you feed your dog an unbalanced home prepared diet, it can take years for the problems to appear. This is because it's the micro-nutrition (vitamins and minerals) that are probably lacking, instead of the calories.\r\nFor example, a dog might do fine for weeks or years, but some time later the dog may get a fractured leg because of long term calcium deficiency in his diet.\r\n\r\n*The Healthy Delicious Homemade Dog Food Cookbook has recipes for all dogs\r\n\r\n*The Healthy Homemade Dog Food Cookbook\r\n\r\n*The Healthy Homemade Dog Food Cookbook has recipes for all dogs - including healthy dogs as well as dogs with various health conditions.\r\n\r\n*How to Prepare Home Cooked Food for Your Dog\r\n\r\n*The Best Homemade Dog Food Recipes\r\n\r\nGUIDELINES TO CREATING BALANCED HOMEMADE DOG FOOD RECIPES\r\n\r\n*Ingredients For Dog Food Made At Home\r\n\r\n*Home Made Dog Food The Easy Way!\r\n\r\n*Home Made Dog Food - The Basics\r\n\r\n*What Should and Shouldn’t Go Into Your Recipe\r\n\r\n*How to Make Your Own Dog Food\r\n\r\nWhy You Should Make Your Own Dog Food\r\nIf that story wasn’t enough for you, there are many other reasons to ditch the bag and make your own dog food.\r\n\r\nHomemade Dog Food Recipes\r\nI know that was a lot of information and you’re probably overwhelmed. But really all you need to do is pick a diet plan and then choose a recipe that you like from the list we’ve compiled.\r\n\r\nMany of these meals can fit into multiple categories (like a grain free puppy food that can be made in a crockpot) so be sure to scan through them all.\r\n\r\nIf you like this Application please consider leaving a positive review and/or rating for it in the store. \r\n\r\nDo not hesitate to make your comment, suggestion, advice and so on via kzapps88@gmail.com",

Dogs have different nutritional needs than people, so you&#39;ll need to understand what makes a balanced diet for your pet. Once you understand that nutritional balance, start making and feeding your dog delicious home-cooked meals.<br><br>It includes vegetarian, gluten-free and special occasion dog food recipes, BARF diet advice, general dog health and nutritional considerations, including what you should never feed your dog to keep it happy and healthy. <br><br>Check out the recipes for diabetic dogs, dogs with heart conditions, food sensitivities and allergies, and learn how to make tasty dog biscuits, stews, fishcakes, cinnamon apple crisps, dehydrated food, christmas and thanksgiving dog food recipes, and many more recipes your dog will absolutely love. This book will even show you how to make natural shampoo and conditioner for your best pal.<br><br>Written by a chef and dog-lover, the &quot;Beg Worthy&quot; recipes in this cookbook will have them beggin&#39; for more!<br><br>Every good dog deserves to be spoiled. This book goes out to all the loyal companions out there that give so much but don&#39;t expect much in return - only love, and hopefully, some tasty food! - Charlie Fox<br><br>Understand the difference between the diet of your dog and a dog in the wild. Yes, wolves or wild dogs can survive in the wild without balanced meals. But, their average lifespan is considerably shorter. They also eat very differently than your dog is used to. While you might feed your dog pure protein, dogs in the wild eat organs like kidney, liver, brain, and the contents of the guts. This makes for a more complex nutrition than simply feeding meat (protein) and rice (carbohydrate) from the store.<br>If you feed your dog an unbalanced home prepared diet, it can take years for the problems to appear. This is because it&#39;s the micro-nutrition (vitamins and minerals) that are probably lacking, instead of the calories.<br>For example, a dog might do fine for weeks or years, but some time later the dog may get a fractured leg because of long term calcium deficiency in his diet.<br><br>*The Healthy Delicious Homemade Dog Food Cookbook has recipes for all dogs<br><br>*The Healthy Homemade Dog Food Cookbook<br><br>*The Healthy Homemade Dog Food Cookbook has recipes for all dogs - including healthy dogs as well as dogs with various health conditions.<br><br>*How to Prepare Home Cooked Food for Your Dog<br><br>*The Best Homemade Dog Food Recipes<br><br>GUIDELINES TO CREATING BALANCED HOMEMADE DOG FOOD RECIPES<br><br>*Ingredients For Dog Food Made At Home<br><br>*Home Made Dog Food The Easy Way!<br><br>*Home Made Dog Food - The Basics<br><br>*What Should and Shouldn’t Go Into Your Recipe<br><br>*How to Make Your Own Dog Food<br><br>Why You Should Make Your Own Dog Food<br>If that story wasn’t enough for you, there are many other reasons to ditch the bag and make your own dog food.<br><br>Homemade Dog Food Recipes<br>I know that was a lot of information and you’re probably overwhelmed.

I lost a promo code because I had to cancel and rebook to be able to effectively modify my booking. I'm deeply confused regarding this bug because it used to work perfectly.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Ok that you can book tables easily. However, you can only spend the loyalty points at ~7 average looking restaurants in central London. I'm in Devon, it's not very useful to me! Have the TripAdvisor app and it's just as easy to book tables through that.",
            "Easy to book tables, but to be honest we're all here for the great discounts. I love it!",
            "Awesome! DawnIaod (WHAFF) App for FREE MONEY. Absolutely, love it! Genius level game. I am nowlevel we.put one annozing thing about this game is that the rest team has got much betterweapons than the left team. I've been getting more feed back whatsoever regarding my game that freezes i out of mgames to play. I lost a lot of points because of this issued, and thereis absolutely nothing wrong with my internet connection. The game completely freezing.Please mix this, this has been going on since theold version oni anniversary.",
            "Works as expected. I haven't experienced any problems with it so far. When I book with a discount, restaurants are always aware of it. I like the fact that I can even book directly within Google Maps without opening TheFork app."

Weight loss is made more difficult when you have a ton of emotional baggage like I have. Having the facts - the actual numbers - in front of me helps me stay on track. I also must mention the scanner. It is wonderful!",
            "App works great. Fairly easy to learn and use. Would be 5 stars if it showed a total daily macros on a pie chart instead of a huge layout form that is very difficult to read and quite useless. Like the diabetes carb count, that is most useful to me. Would also like to know how to delete self created recipes but help section isn't very helpful and doesn't explain how. Love the huge database with many foods I use and happy with how easy and quick it is to add the odd new food that isn't there."

            "I love her recipes! This app makes it easier to save your favorites and come back to them later. Also, the ingredients and directions are in two separate tabs making it easier to go back and forth while cooking.",
            "I was excited when Angela brought Oh She Glows to an app, but it seems to have very quickly been put on the back burner by the awesome blogger. She hasn't updated her blog recently, either. The Oh She Glows team seems to be focused on cookbooks these days. The cookbooks are great, but if you cant take on that many projects at once, don't launch a for-sale app and then not update it. The recipes were basically a repeat of what's on the blog, anyway. Don't bother.",
            "Its just a long list of recepies. No tools like ingredients filters, automatic shopping list generator or weekly plans. Then to get Oh Glow recipes it's another £0.69 in app purchase. Considering this app was advertised online as being only $0.99 for iPhone users I feel short changed. Must be a better app out there for the money. Also i prefer skills, techniques, food science over just a list of recipes."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

The main symptoms include itchy, red patches of thick skin with silvery scales on the elbows, knees, scalp, back, face, palms, and feet.\r\n\r\nPsoriasis can be irritating and stressful. Creams, ointments, medications, and light therapy may help. However, some research suggests diet might also alleviate symptoms.\r\n\r\nSo far, research on diet and psoriasis is limited.

        "comments": [
            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "I'm a fan of your games, y'all always have such creative and thoughtful games for us. My favorites from the stimulation games are the horse and now this one. The main complaint I have and what's keeping it from a 5 star is that every once in a while my bear just dies... For no reason. The health is good, food is fine, water... But my bear dies. Maybe its a glitch? Not sure but if that could be fixed I'd really appreciate it!!",
            "I love how u can run around. Only, you should be able to find more bears to join your family. If u did that I would get ALL your games glutin free! Anyway, plz get beehives to knock down, and bears that can join your family, like the horse one. Plz make these changes thank you. Please make hirvivor games, like, Gazzel,Zebra, chicken, hippo, cat, dog, you know, a bunch of games that would be really cool. Please do those Thanks!",
            "I love catching the fish but four star because I think the controls should be like cheetah and wild horse sim. P.S I am aiming to get all your games, they are definitely the best kind of apps in the store! Can u make alley cat sim, stray dog sim, and maybe even a wild rabbit sim? Your games are the best... Keep it up!",
            "Can you make different seasons and you have to hibernate in winter? Also plz make rabbit Sim cougar Sim (cougars are the same things as mountain lions and pumas) Make lion Sim more like ultimate wolf Sim and plz make you games free I want all of them. So yeah make more Sims especially wild cat ones. I love you gluten free games! :3 kitty face EDIT make an ultimate lion Sim plz",
            "Can u make a stray dog simulator? And your goal is to find a family and a home or you can get a job as a police dog u can still have a family if ur a police dog. Also u can choose from any dog u want"

            "I really have nothing else to say. The app is a lost cause. I made a point many years ago when the app was first launched about the app kept messing up the syncing process between the quantity or record of a wine entry with the record at the database server. This problem was never fixed! Today I found the same error with the quantity of a wine I have just couple days ago, and I found the quantity of the wine was unchanged. Can u trust a tech company can't even get its database syncing right?",
            "This should allow two ratings. For looking up wines and getting descriptions and reviews, this app is great. You can even take a photo of the label and most of the time it'll find it. This has kept me away from accidentally buying sweet wines (not my gig). Love it for this use. Then I used Vivino for ordering wine - I have done it twice. Once the order was placed and weeks later it didn't ship. No notice why or if it would be shipped. Cancelled that. Later I tried again, ordering a case of one of my go-to wines from a different sub-retailer in Vivino. The order was shipped in a very reasonable time this order, but upon opening it they had substituted for the entire case with a different wine. No warning, just did it. Were it one bottle, I would be (only) ok with this, but for a case, without warning, this is unacceptable. The thing that has ended my ordering on Vivino is that, having had this happen, I can't get Vivino to even answer an email or respond to the 'contact' tab on their site. I frankly don't know if anyone works there anymore, certainly nobody is manning the email address or contact input. I have reached out both ways for the third time today and will be calling the credit card to have the charges reversed.",
            "Why only 4 stars?! The application is good, pretty sure I'll use it for several times, but the 1st thing I noticed, that the tutorial after the \"see how it works\" button is completely unreadable (at least for me it is..). Light brownish background with small grey text. Please take into consideration to change it. :)",
            "Love it and recommend it often. It's a great way to broaden your palette. I've tried so many new wines based on a decent rating and generally been happy I did. Also helped me to avoid a few bad ones.",
            "Used to be a good app, but now it's just annoying when it takes over your screen to install a non-existent update, that usually comes along a week after the first red screen appears. Suggestions to remove the annoyance have gone unheard (contacted via the app)"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

And, Who Doesn't like a wee-bit of Candy?!? Like they say, \"Always remain a Kid at Heart.\", I believe in that!! This Willy Wonka slots is just Brilliant & Lively to Play. It has other Awards that you can win throughout the game, little side games you could say, in which all adds to your \"coins\". Great Work peeps, in the Making of this game!🍭🍬🍫👻",
            "Almost impossible to complete monopoly game. Need 1 Free Spin. 500 spins later still no free spin. The Game knows the challenges you have to complete. And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",
            "This is by far my favorite slots game. I like the weekly competitions and side games. I enjoy the interactive slot games, all the oompa loompa slots on all levels. With they had it where you could use real cash. They would be F****** awesome...",
            "Very expensive to play. Trying to hit daily and weekly goals has cost thousands. More expensive to play than a real casino slot machine. Promotional game wiped out points with nearly 600 near-consecutive losses. The Zynga algos are geared for max losses.",
            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"
