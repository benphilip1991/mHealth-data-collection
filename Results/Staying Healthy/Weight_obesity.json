            "This app has been wonderful for me. It calculates your BMI and even calculates when you'll get to your desired weight from the progress of your current weight loss. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to track their weight loss, it shows your current weight loss on a graph so it's exciting to see the line get lower and lower the more you get to your goal weight.",
            "I love this as a rule, but I want the graph to show the startpoint. Line disappears off the left side of the graph for me and I want to see all the data at once for reference, or at least be able to scroll back if all the data won't fit as is. I flipped the app to landscape to see if that helped, but the graph in landscape is completely unreadable. Will go 5-stars if these issues are fixed.",
            "This app has a very good weight progress graphic, BMI calculator is great. Statistics page is well presented, but its contents need work: - I was looking for weekly weight average (preferably with week by week history) or at least last 7 days running average. It could replace the all time average that is not very useful, e.g. I went from 178 to 135 in 8 month, so what does the 148 average tell me? - It would be nice to be able to export-import weight points history from/to a simple file - the data backup did not work so far - the Google Fit synchronization did not work so far",
            "Easy, useful, organized. Have never had a problem with this app. I tried many weight tracking apps that I quickly deleted but finally found this app and I would never delete it. It's one of my favorite apps on my phone and I use it daily with satisfaction. I like its user friendly interface. I love that it includes a graph of your weight over periods of time, as well as a list of dates with weight loss/gain amount. I don't find the ads to ruin my experience, Please keep this app top quality.",
            "Simple app. Simple and user friendly interface. Simple data entry. You need to enter exactly what you need to track your weight....and it lets you add historical data. Shows a simple graph. I wanted exactly this... nothing more, nothing less. Simple is beautiful. Edit: I have reduced my rating to 3 stars because this app has an Google Drive integration issue when it comes to backing up and restoring data. I always had backup turned on. I recently broke my old phone. So I switched to a new one which is much older and has an Android 5. However, all apps work on it including this one. I tried to recover my 3-month worth of data that I had painstakingly entered but the app could not restore anything. I checked my Google drive and there's nothing saved from this app. Even on the new phone, this app cannot create/save backups. I am using the age old Excel to keep track of my daily fitness. I guess humans are yet to get past the MS Excel era..."

It literally keeps you away from eating boring fruits and veggies. It even gives free exercise session which are awesome.

            "Very excellent app, very good for beginners who have never been on a diet before and the meals are actually surprisingly fillingüëç",

Well, I did it by cutting out alcohol, eating well and plenty of walking. But this app helped me along the way by giving me clear inspiration each day.",

            "It's perfect app!! I love it! It's simple and usefull",
            "Very informative, very easy to use, very minimal ads, accurate data, this is the best app out there, it measures everything. I love it so much, this is the exact type of app I was looking for after I googled healthy weight, BMI etc. **Perfect for male and female ** TIP: If you wish to measure yourself and you don't know how too, use a sewing measuring tape and start at the number one and at your belly button, for your neck, start In the middle, wrap it around and mark where it wraps up too."

            "Just starting using this app yesterday and thus far I'm enjoying it. Didn't want to rate it yet as it's too soon, however, don't want to keep seeing the message come up each time I open the app asking for a rating. Wish I could change the font color on the widget, but doesn't allow at this time. For now, I would rate it 3 1/2 stars if it allowed me to, but can only rate whole numbers. Looking forward to continue using it and updating my rating over the coming months. Thanks Team!",
            "It's a good app in the main tho I think it's ability to measure body fat is doubtful as it has no real way of knowing how much or how little muscle we have. Ditto the bmi. It's also telling me to eat 2454 calories a day. Er... That is how I put weight on in the first place. I like the ability to record my losses or gains lol.",
            "This app is fantastic. The way it shows your progress is extremely motivating. I have struggled with weight issues my whole life and on multiple occasions I've lost a combined 50 kg with this app. Back on it now, hopefully for the last time!",
            "Very easy to use and d oes exactly whats needed when you are on a weightloss mission. Gives you a boost to see your progress. Shows you how many calories you can have in order to meet your target and shows through spreadsheets etc how you are shaping up! Excellent.",
            "It's true that seeing your weight everyday can be challenging but at the weeks end to see you have actually loss weigh is very encouraging. I don't count calories but I do try to make good choices. Even on my birthday! Lol I like this approach and the app!"

            "Have been using the app for over two years and does exactly what I want. Was using the free version and had a problem with the database due to changing from imperial to metric units (and changing back again). Emailed support and they had fixed the database for me within 24 hours. Decided to purchase to remove the adds as a thank you. Great service.",
            "The app itself is quite useful as a simple tracker, but the ads are obnoxious. Also, I swiched it at some point from kilograms to pounds, and it really messed up the conversion. (It converted my kg to lb - so 50 kg becomes 110lb - then called those kg, so that that was originally 50kg became 110kg, or 240lb. Didn't do the same when switching back, however. So my now 240lb converted back to 110kg. For my entire history.)",
            "When I switched to a new phone today, I lost my entire log history. This app doesn't let u sign in with an email so it can save data. I tried exporting it, but the file I chose didn't have enough space. So I tried to export it somewhere else but it won't let me switch it to a different location. All my other app's data saved effortlessly because I just signed back in. Very frustrating.",
            "I have never chosen a better app than this one. It simple yet can be complex. I like the color display. All the other features I don't need for now, but be able to activate them when needed.",
            "It was fine until I changed the settings from lbs to kg & it converted the values incorrectly. When I switched back to lb, it doubled the original value which was in lb, so now all of my previous years of data are double what they should be."

            "I don't like the new update. By that I mean I liked the sliding scale where you could find your exact height if you're in between an inch or something- you can't do that anymore it just rounds up or down. This app was super accurate before and now I feel I have to try and find one that will do this again- I hate that cause it took me so long to find this one to begin with. Please change that back!",
            "Used this app earlier and now decided to install again. And now it doesn't work for me on Galaxy S3 Duos. It's just stucking on the main screen. I thought ttat it might be because of I had it on my phone already but it doesn't work on my wife's phone too. She didn't use it before and she have the same phone model. It's sad :(",

Everything is lumped into the descriptor \"overweight,\" and unless the standard changed, that isn't helpful. And I don't know why, but I find it annoying that the calculator no longer reflects fractions of inches in height."

I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard üí™.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

        "description": "Body Measurement and Weight Loss Tracker allows you to track and chart all of your most important body measurements including weight, waist, hips, thighs, biceps, body fat percentage and Body Mass Index (BMI). In addition to being a weight loss tracker this app allows you to  track any custom body measurements you can think of (shoulders, skeletal muscle %, body water % etc.) on your mobile device.  What‚Äôs more, you can instantly chart the changes in your body stats over time, and your data is automatically synced to the cloud if you login.  \r\n\r\nThe app also includes a built-in body fat calculator and will calculate lean body mass, body fat mass, waist-to-hips ratio and daily caloric needs as well.  \r\n\r\nThe app also integrates with Google Fit allowing you to import from or export weight measurements to Google Fit. The app will also import nutritional information from allowing you to see Calories Consumed, Calories Expended and Net Calories plotted against any measurement or calculated value.  This integration requires an in-app purchase. \r\n\r\nWhen using a weight loss tracker, it is important to monitor not only what and how much you eat, but also your weight and other indicators of health such as body fat percentage, waist, hips etc. Since body weight can fluctuate up to 5 lbs (2.3kg) per day, it is important to weigh yourself on a regular basis and at a consistent time every day.  This way, by looking at your body measurement chart, you will be able to assess your weight loss trend over time.  Some digital scales provide an estimate of body fat percentage, which you can save within Body Measurement Tracker to determine whether your weight loss is a result of a desirable loss in body fat.  Alternatively, by measuring waist, neck, height and hip circumferences the app‚Äôs body fat calculator will automatically calculate body fat and lean mass percentages and chart them over time.  If your lean body mass is calculated successfully, the app will also estimate your daily caloric need based on your stated activity level and sex.  \r\n\r\nBody Measurement and Weight Loss Tracker is customizable allowing you to track any body measurement you can think of and ignore the ones you are not interested in.  The following measurements are included by default:\r\n\r\n- Waist\r\n- Weight\r\n- Hips\r\n- Body Fat Percentage\r\n- Body Mass Index (BMI)\r\n- Chest\r\n- Upper Arms (biceps and triceps)\r\n- Lower Arms (forearms)\r\n- Upper Legs (thighs/quads and hamstrings)\r\n- Lower Legs (calves)\r\n- Height\r\n\r\nBody Progress Photos\r\nKeep tabs of how you look over time by taking an unlimited number of pictures of your body.  Just like the rest of your data, your body progress photos are automatically synced so they can be viewed across devices, so you never have to worry about losing them ever again.\r\n\r\nCalculated Body Stats\r\nThe following body stats are automatically calculated, if you have recorded the required measurements:\r\nBody Mass Index (BMI) - The BMI is the ratio of body mass to the square of the body height and is a very commonly used index to categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese.  Overweight and obese individuals are at greater risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke and more.  \r\nBody Fat Percentage - The body fat percentage is the total weight of fat divided by the total body weight.  It can be estimated many ways, but since the body fat calculator relies on the measurement of height, weight and body circumferences, the Navy Method for body fat estimation is used.  This method relies on waist, neck and height measurements for males and waist, neck, height and hip measurements for females.  \r\nWaist to Hips Ratio - The waist to hips ratio is a useful indicator of overall health. \r\n\r\nIcons made by Kiranshastry from  www.flaticon.com",

            "This is hands down the best weight loss recording app I have tried. It uses an accurate bmi and I couldn't be happier!",
            "Just feels like this app has most of the relevant features. I give 5/5 since I haven't found another app that is this close to what I want!",
            "brilliant app, has everything I need, and the ads don't bother me. if i could wish for one thing to be added though, I'd ask for a better way to see the comments in weight history. after a while of using the app it gets harder to go back and see when I had something interesting happen to my weight, and going thru day by day is tedious. maybe putting the comment info below the main data would be ok? if it wouldn't be too cluttery. what do you think? anyway, thank you for all of your hard work! ^^"

Very frustrating app",
            "Useful for tracking weight and keeping notes without a lot of extra calorie counting stuff. HOWEVER. To be truly perfect, app needs to offer a way to track weight in longer than 30-day increments AND to be able to set the date range for the \"Lost Weight\" box. Most people don't care about seeing the 30-day or less change, weight loss is a much longer range activity! Right now I have to put the total loss since beginning of my tracking in the notes. And finally, it was ridiculous not to be able to type in my date of birth, instead having to scroll back over 20 years of monthly calendars!"

Also, entering numbers with scroll selectors is like threading a needle every time. WW has a option to tap on the number and type the data. If you could add this I'd be so appreciative! It would also be nice to be able to 'like' replies in Community and to reply to people by name.",
            "I've been having trouble with the app with the new upgrade. When I try to enter info on a new food or add a recipe, I get a blank screen. This is a pain and hope it fixed soon. I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",
            "I love this program however, the update 2 days ago messed up typing on the community boards. You can't see what u type. Others are having the same issue too. Help!!!",
            "The text is much too light to read! Too many steps to find a food. Should be more like the app lose it. But please, make the text darker."

            "The concept is quite good, just a few issues with implementation. The photo is always sideways, average weight shows wrong on calender (max weight is 270, average weight is 560), and it messes up measurement often(will not let me edit or sometimes add). If these are corrected, the app would be vastly better.",
            "Update: realized it displays measurements in inches but wants input as centimeters and have to turn phone sideways to get picture to be upright. Giving 4 stars because lack of clarity in inputs and can only take one photo. Would like to see progress of different angles. Don't waste your time. It changes everything you input and flips your picture upside down or sideways",
            "App doesn't work properly. You can choose your theme screen but still remains non functional except for the plus button. When you add body measurement it doesn't let you add the measurement that you want, it just does its own thing.",
            "Great app. The only downside is that you can't transfer the info you recorded, to another phone which means that if you change your phone, you lose all the progress records and have to start from zero",
            "I wish there photos could be edited or asjusted in the app.pics i take i portrait mode come up sideways in thr app. even when they dont its difficult to watch the slideshow since the photots dont all line up with each other. aome kind of crosshair to ise when linkng them up woukd be helpful."

It's not one of those apps that have everything from calorie counters to diet suggestions but it works great for me since all I need is somewhere to keep a list of the meals I have in a day and write \"notes to self\" to keep me focused on my goal. Excellent app!",

            "It really is a well-designed and very usefull app. But somehow my diary entries are not being saved. Is there any way you could fix this? I'd be really happy. Apart from this, I can highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to stay on track with their weight!",

            "Pretty good app! It's cute and I love the passcode protect. Maybe encourages potential dangerous ideas with \"disappointed\" stickers when you gain weight. But I love this app, the graph is helpful and so is the diary"

            "I've been using this app for a while now. It's pretty good for weight tracking, but I have a few issues with it. 1) I find that the weight does not upload unless the app is open. And every now and then the scale doesn't send the results even while the app is open. 2) I dislike that you can't change how the \"Year\" and \"Total\" views look. Currently, both are depicted by smoother lines - likely the average per month - than the \"Week\" and \"Month\" view. Other apps find a way to graph 365/366 points.",
            "This app works great with my scale. Even if I don't open it for a few days when I do it loads all the days on the scale at once making it easy to track progress. I've noticed I can switch my scale goals at any times. It is kind of a long process to add another person to the scale, but really easy to keep everyone's profile separately.",
            "Useless, parisitic app that used to be great. Now it forces me to give my location info to sync with my scale,. And the screen to update my goal weight is broken (missing enter/okay button). Disappointing, but then again, the way most apps are designed these days, I guess I'll just have to get used to disappointment.",
            "Was a little tricky to set up initially and I didn't really like that. But having used this for several months it has been very reliable in sinking and it just uses a simple web views so I can actually take a look at all the bars and graphs on my desktop as well.",
            "May as well just manually enter your data. Bluetooth integration persistently fails. Works just often enough to demonstrate that it **can** work, but doesn't. DO NOT BUY THIS SCALE!"

I'd probably recommend this. The exercises are really hard! Which makes it easier to lose weight & faster. Exercise for 30-60 days, And then you should lose weight by then. Awesome app I love it!! I'm trying to lose 10-20kg. And it'd be a great opportunity ‚ò∫Ô∏è. As im young myself, And love wearing crop tops. Thanks!!",

The exercises, I can keep up with them, but not always do them 100% correctly, because some of it is quite tiring or needs a bit of exercising experience. I am struggling with some of the food on the list, but i am very determined and i just do it. I am day 5, and i got on the scale, i could not believe! I don't feel i have put on, but the same scale that showed 51kg 5 days ago, now shows 54. Worth every effort!",

            "Noom puts the \"fun\" in \"functional\" plus it's easy to use! This app has short, informative articles that always make me chuckle. I lost weight right away during the 14-day trial, now I'm signed up for the next three months! This isn't like any other wellness app... you gotta try it for yourself to see just what I love about Noom. Totally worth it!!",
            "Originally thought I was getting my money's worth. But now they removed their built-in pedometer (which is the only device/app I was using) and they also removed the GPS tracking for when you do a workout and you want to know the distance you went (walk, hike, bike, etc). Very disappointed. I can't even accurately track my exercice anymore with this latest update they did! How am I supposed to figure out the distance I just hiked in order to punch it in manually? Ridiculous update.",
            "I absolutely love Noom! I've never had so much fun and success loosing weight! I love the tracking calories and seeing how many I have left, all the information they give you every day and the fun way they explain it, the coach, the group interaction! This is for me. I'm going to sign up my daughter too. I've only lost 9 pounds so far, but I know I'll stick with it and loose the rest ( unlike other diets) because I'm really enjoying it and learning so much. I love Noom!",
            "I absolutely love this! You learn how to eat better, and eat less. Noom helps you to be accountable for everything from nutrition to fitness! It is also motivational and you have a personal coach to help you along the way. You set realistic long term and short term goals for yourself. One thing that surprised me was I've always been a healthy eater, but with noom I realized I was eating way too dense. So far Ive lost 5 lbs and its the first week! If you put in the work, youll see results!",
            "So far mostly ok. Two main complaints: 1. Step tracking. Originally I set it up to sync with Fitbit and adjust goals daily, but it wasn't working so I tried to remove the link to Fitbit but now it only lets me choose a different app. I just want to log steps manually. 2. Why do they have you add on a meal plan and exercise plan but NOT have those integrated into the app? If I'd known in advance these would be just emailed to me and not really part of the program I wouldn't have gotten them."

            "I give this app 5 stars for fulfilling it's intended purpose better than any other similar app! It doesn't make me dread it like all the other ones. Workouts are quick and easy but still leave you sweating and feeling like you got a good workout. This, combined with a clean diet, has made me lose 5 pounds in 1.5 weeks. Two things I would love to see added, is the ability to control rest times and set times, as well as weight tracking.",
            "App gives you good intense workouts every day. There's about 5 different plans to pick from. Each one turning up the heat. These workouts are short & sweet & don't mess around. Would give 5 stars however I believe I should be able to see how many minutes each work out takes & I should be able to see a rough estimate of how many calories burned during each work out but it adds up the calories burnt & time from each work out together instead.",
            "I really like the exercises. You can turn off the music and audio if you want. Just a couple downsides, there's no way to reset a course, you can take it again but it'll always tell you've completed the course. The Feedback option on the menu doesn't do anything, like at all, kinda suspicious....",
            "I am on day 13 and it has helped me so much with being consistent, which is my main problem. I really feel a difference in my body and my energy. It was a struggle at first and as it gets tougher I can actually keep up. I can do way more than I did when I started and it just helps me stay motivated. Definitely recommend for anybody trying to be a bit more healthy.",
            "I like how it gradually builds up to more intensive exercises. Great for keeping track, and just getting you moving. Especially now that we're spending more time at home, it's great to open the app, and spend 5-15mins going through the exercises."

However, having tried a few of the other body fat calculator apps, I can say that this is one of the best free lightweight apps of its kind currently available.",

For example: I'm 6'3\", 208lbs,13.5% bodyfat (per most accurate calculation using submersion test), but this app indicated 28.6% BF - more than 2x the correct amount, and it recommended a 171lb bodyweight! That would require < 0% BF and/or extreme loss of muscle. Just stupid!!! My wife had similar results, so no there is gender or athletic correlation to explain gross errors.",

            "This app ticks all the boxes for me for a weight tracking app (I've tried many). It has a decent barcode scanner and a reasonably well curated database, option to save meals and recipes, and a breakdown of macronutrients you consumed in the free subscription. It doesn't try to solve all the world's problems and do it poorly. That's impressively hard to find! I also like the UI, it's pretty, intuitive and uncluttered.",
            "Really love this app. I have used it for a month with no problems, but today I can't go to my goals without the app shutting down. Please fix this! Until today I would have given 5 stars. I've reported problem but haven't heard a response yet.",
            "Bugs fixed. I'd like to add that the year subscription is totally worth it. When paired with GoogleFit I have lost 25 lbs in three months. App holds you 100% accountable when no one else can, if you cheat you cheat yourself out of weight loss. Follow your plan , exceed your goals and the weight will fall off. By the time you realize it it is already a habit and you are accounting for everything u consume. The app will inform u of the areas that need improvement.",
            "Most nutritional information in this app is incorrect. For example, items like calories, carbohydrates and proteins are not always correct and in fact very can be far off. Where my actual carbohydrates are 180g, this app will tell me they are only 130g. This may have something to do with the fact that anyone can go in and adjust nutritional information. The app would be great otherwise but I cannot continue to use it or refer my clients because of the abundant false nutritional information.",
            "Two updates now and calories still do not change when weight changes. I have emailed support, but I guess the engineers just don't care that their app does not work properly. Not sure what their focus is within the app, but they sure are not good a fixing things they screw up thats for sure. I given up on emailing. Seems to be a huge waste of time."

The app allows you to type in a correct number but does not save it and goes right back to saying it's in the 30s.

            "i was certainly sceptical of this weight loss tips and tricks app's claim when i downloaded it. but here i am, 26 days later, and 9 pounds lighter. I can easily see a difference looking in the mirror now. So, thanks to the developer indeed! only one suggestion, let me manually replace an exercise with something else when the day's list is generated.",

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

            "The experience with the program itself was worse than sub standard. Disinterested deitician who have set of canned answers and options and cannot really give you sound advice. Waste of money - 6 months on the program, payment upfront - cumulative weight loss 3kg - could have lost a lot more on my own without spending the inordinate amount of cash. Don't waste your time or effort - not worth it.",
            "Hey team, This app is broke, i put in my details as 20yrs old, 5'8 , 53 kg and target weight as 60kg. It said i fall in Ideal weight category and instead of showing weight gain plans it was recommending me weight loss plans! To cross verify i put in my current weight as 40kg and to my surprise it was still saying i fall in ideal weight category. Either your app doesn't has any weight gain plans or it is simply broke. Kindly look forward to this.",
            "Although I started my journey with Truweight hardly a month ago yet I could achieve a remarkable reduction and stability in my blood sugar levels from the region of 180-250 to a level between 105-130. This coupled with a weight loss of 1kg is very important for me. And what is most important is that it has been achieved not by eating less but by eating right. I am thankful to my coach for guiding me through.",

It logged down 3 steps just starting it and for every 1 step I did, it showed at least 5. I downloaded the basic version to see if preminum would be worth it. The two main things I wanted in an app are two that are inaccurate or unavailable.",
            "I intent of this app is just want I needed. Unfortunately for me, the execution just didn't live up to expectations. For example, I have a watch to track my steps & the app doesn't allow you to enter them, only miles. The vital section does not contain BP. It is located in another section. The BMI calculator is not accurate, imo. There are additional issues that I have w/ the app but I believe it's due to personal preferences & needs. Overall, it's a decent app just not for me.",
            "I hate that you have to slide to get the numbers instead of just typing it in. Also it will not allow me to enter my food intake for this date. It automatically started at January 1st and when I changed it, it still entered to Jan 1st. Even though the date on the calender was correct.",
            "I do like the app, but it doesn't have a feature to switch to feet/inches of to fl. ounces. I also wish it could connect to google fit, fitbit, and other fitness trackers. If this is fixed then I could in good continuous give this app five stars.",
            "Very systematically efficient app. Algorithms properly arranged. Quality Control at its peak. No chance for complain. Has used different variety of colours in an unique way. Very light-weighted app. Can be easily downloaded with low data speed. Works as an accountant of our body. Gives us the invoice of our body's physical ability. No need to buy expensive smart watches. Just download this app and enjoy!"

Uninstalled and refund requested until it works as it's supposed to!!",

I had thought it was useless as I couldn't work out how to add any data. Every button I selected gave me one reply. \"This feature is available in Pro version\". Would benefit from a smple guide to say how to add a measurement. Giving this another go as it seems to be what I'm looking for. Thanks for the help.",

One suggestion would be to have the choice of directly typing in the numbers.",

        "description": "Easy and Useful App to calculate your BMI (Body Mass Index), Waist-to-Height Ratio, Body Fat Percentage and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). It is very useful for your weight loss and fitness plans\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Body Mass Index: is defined as the body weight divided by the square of the height. It provides a rough guide since it doesn't take into account a person build or the composition of the body weight.\r\n‚Ä¢ Waist-to-Height Ratio: is defined as the waist circumference divided by the height.

Have reached out to them multiple times over email and have received only one automated response in return. Taking money for the pro version then pulling the application out -- that's a proper scam. There is no guarantee that, if one pays for the pro subscription now, these developers won't ring in the same scam again. Uninstall. Move on.",
            "I have purchased the pro version which I prefer over the free one. This isn't a bad app at all but there is certainly loads of room for improvement. Some suggestions: Add a barcode scanner, healthy alternative options, recipes, grocery lists, conversions and being able to connect to different exercise devices or: Fitbit, Garmin, Google fit etc. My rating will definitely change to 5 star with some or all of these options included.",
            "I've used this app before, paid for the basics. Now that is gone, when I look for foods most are gone now. It's like you deleted your food library. Uninstalling it and looking for a new app. No longer works for me.",
            "Had this app numerous times, and every time ive tried a new one always came back to this one.

For someone like me who has ibs it is great to log what u have eaten that day and symptoms as well as weight loss planning :)",

Now, I didn't mind needing to pay for Pro again with the new app, but I'm pretty upset that I can't even access the features I paid for... I still get ads, can't access my weight chart.

            "Have only used it once so far but i love this app. Easy to follow along. Layout is easy to understand. First app in a very long time that i found with a clean logical layout. Well done. The excersizes were easy enough to do that i was not intimidated, short enough to not get bored or overwhelmed yet long enough you feel immediate results. So far overall a wonderfull app. Thank you.",
            "I love the yoga moves and I love the way it presents everything. My only complaint is that it doesn't tell you when the individual exercise is complete so I'm stuck having to stare at my phone instead on concentrating on the exercise watching for the end so I know to stop and get into the next exercise position. I would give 5 stars if that issue was fixed.",
            "I have used this in the past, having gone through rehabilitation of my body after not having been able to walk for a week at all to using one leg for 4 months after a femur fracture and kneecap fracture, this helped me to regain energy and flexibility and lose weight. Now years later after giving birth to a baby I am using this again. Same results, works so far, added edge i need to my routine! Thank you to the creator and all involved in this app and all related apps, great job.",
            "The routines are workouts that challenge your abilities in a healthy way. I feel good afterwards. Doing a routine every morning for awhile will definitely contribute to weight loss long term and improve my flexibility. Also convenient, all you need is a nice quiet space and maybe a yoga mat. Looking forward to continuing to use it."

            "** Update..I have changed my rating since the update did correct the issue. Thank You! I like this app but it has been giving me a lot of clinches lately. I'm trying to verify my weight & record the video but it keeps giving me an error message saying that it cannot access my camera to try again later. I uninstalled & reinstalled the app & still I'm getting the same error message. How am I supposed to continue verifying my weight if the app is now allowing me to do it? This is very exhausting!",
            "I love the program. I'm not doing good if you think about the amount of weight I've lost, but the program is great for me, because it makes me think about what I'm eating, and I've lost 15lbs and I've been trying to lose some kind of weight all my life. I might not win my prize money, but I'm winning my battle little by little and also my self esteem. Thanks I'm still in it to win it. Margaret",
            "I have used this app 3 times to help me lose weight. I like being able to see the progress of others on the challenge. 6% is not a great amount to lose in 3 months is plenty of time. Having a little money in the pot makes it much easier for me to follow through. I have always met my goal and one more money than I put in.",
            "I've done this twice now and they definitely paid the first time. I was skeptical at first that maybe this company would be taking my money and running. But they didnt. Only thing I wish they would change is: show us how much we paid for our challenges. They show what you won but it's hard to remember how much u paid. Specially when your doing a lot of challenges. I just want to see the profit.",
            "Used to work good now they are having problem processing payments. I was told the issue was effecting many people. Update still tried not working tried 3 different cards. Hmm they work every where else. Used to really like this app."

            "I love this app. Very easy to use and lots of options available. I only wish there were ways to customize based on preferences and food allergies so you can switch out comparable foods, or even add that. But still a great app. Love the grocery list!!",
            "I love this app. It gives you such a great variety of diet plans and what each one targets. I had my gallbladder and and needed a low fat diet and I found it here. I love the simple shopping list for each week which has made it so simple. The only thing I would like differently is for there to have every week different so you aren't repeating the week before. Overall awesome!",
            "I think I like the meal reminder the best then the grocery list and the variety of plans third. Been using it a long long time.",
            "I miss the support groups that used to be on the app. I met someone from the Netherlands and we became great support tools for each other, and good friends. I miss the \"walk with me\" support group where all the ladies would challenge and encourage each other to walk everyday. This used to be the best part, and it was what made you different from all the other diet apps. Please consider bringing it back.",
            "I've had this app through several different phones over the years. However, even though I've upgraded to pro and there have been updates, there never seem to be any new plans. I saw one reviewer mention keto plans, and I was REALLY hoping for the exact same thing! With as popular and well-supported with research as keto is, you'd think they would add it on here. Oh well......come on, guys, change with the times! Science does, and so should you. :-("

            "The app seems decent...if you're looking for a diet. I specifically searched for a non-diet app (intuitive eating, gentle nutrition etc.), which this app claims it is, but as soon as you enter the app, it tells you you'll have to restrict calories and eat \"healthy\" foods in order to lose weight (not true- weight loss is about controlling insulin), then it asks you to choose a food plan (aka \"diet\"). If you want a diet, and a place to log food and exercise, try it out. Not a \"non diet\" app.",

            "Fairly easy to use but it would benefit from integration with myfitnesspal. Also the way it allows you to adjust your weight is a bit cack handed. It should default to your initial weight or the last date that you entered a weight so you don't have to spin the weight wheel multiple times because you have a large amount of weight to loose. If these are added to the next update then I would be happy to pay for the app",
            "Love this app. Been using it since 2014. I use Wyze scale now, which records my weight automatically on the phone. I still copy the weight to Libra because the graphs are much better with the filtering function, and the way you can zoom is great. I wish there was integration with Wyze scale.",
            "I like the app but the reminder to weigh in every morning just suddenly stopped, despite the setting still being turned on and my app being up to date. Don't understand why it suddenly stopped.",
            "No integration with Google Fit after many years on the app store. Development has been minimal. I paid for plug-in long ago, but it no longer works with the product so I had to \"donate\" to get rid of adds.",
            "Easy to use when setting goals. It is nice to see the trend line in comparison to your set goal. There are visible BMI lines on your weight trend graph to see when you pass a threshold. It is much more masculine than the Apple equivalent HappyScale and has different features, but Libra is great for weight tracking. I highly recommend this in conjunction with MyFitnessPal."

        "description": "*** Note: If anyone experience crash when opening the app after the latest update, please go to your device Settings -> Apps -> BMI Calculator and \"Clear Data\". It will fix the problem. ***\r\n\r\nIn our busy life, we can't be able to maintain our healthy diet or exercise schedule for a long time. So it is important to accurately measure our weight as well as a BMI (body mass index), BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and few other index on a regular basis. It'll remind us that we need a proper diet plan as well as exercise schedule.\r\n\r\nThis app includes the following calculators:\r\n\r\nBMI Calculator\r\n\r\nBMI is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.\r\n\r\nIt is also known as Quetelet index and widely used in medical field. It'll give you the exact idea of your body, fat, muscle and bones. According to that it will give you the result that you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.\r\n\r\nOur BMI calculator is accurate and very easy to use, with options for both female & male body proportion and body type. Calculate your ideal weight based on your body's weight / height ratio and start living in a healthy body.\r\n\r\nBMR Calculator\r\n\r\nYour Basal Metabolic Rate(BMR) is the amount of energy you need while resting in a temperate environment when your digestive system is inactive(which requires about 12 hours of fasting). In such a state, your energy will be used only to maintain your vital organs. The BMR decreases with age and increases with muscle mass.\r\n\r\nCalorie Calculator\r\n\r\nThe Calorie Calculator can be used to estimate the calories you need to consume each day to maintain your weight.\r\n\r\nIBW & ABW Calculator\r\n\r\nThe Ideal Body Weight (IBW) is usually described as a weight that is assumed to be maximal healthful for an individual. As weight exceeds ideal body weight, the risks of developing serious health problems increase. Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) is used to determine the energy needs in hospitalised obese patients.\r\n\r\nLBM Calculator\r\n\r\nThe Lean Body Mass(LBM) is a part of the body. It is normally defined to be the body weight minus the body fat. Typically lean body mass is 60-90% of the total body mass. Normally, men have higher port of lean body mass than women.\r\n\r\nBSA Calculator\r\n\r\nBody Surface Area(BSA) is the total surface area of a human body. In many situations, BSA is a better indicator of metabolic mass than body weight since it is less affected by abnormal body fat.\r\n\r\nAnd Following trackers:\r\n\r\nWeight Tracker\r\n\r\nWeight tracker saves your daily weight and display your data on chart. You can see your day by day progress using weight tracker and it will show you the trend of your weight.\r\n\r\nBMI Tracker\r\n\r\nBMI tracker keep track of your daily BMI result when you enter the data. It will help you to keep track of your BMI using BMI graph. We will add more information in this section in our upcoming updates.\r\n\r\nYou can easily change the unit of weight to: kgs, pound, stone/pound. You can also choose your height in 3 units: cms, meter and feet/inch. This BMI app is very accurate, quick and based according to your body's proportions (weight / height ratio).\r\n\r\nTo maintain an ideal weight, BMI, you have to create proper diet plans which will give you enough calories according to Calorie Calc for your daily routine. On the other hand, you can also create your daily exercise schedule or join a gym for daily fitness.

            "This app does a decent job of keeping track of your weight. The entry process is nice. I don't like the pea green background color at all. It's overbearing, and it's not changeable. It needs a 3 Month graph range. The Year graph is not usable, except for on December 31, because it always starts on January 1. The pop-up ads are on a 5-second timer. It takes longer to wait out the ad than it does to enter the weight data. The $3.49 charge is too high to remove ads from a weight reminder.",

Because we are human we need to eat and this app doesn't keep track of that, so unless you already have a diet plan AND you wanna do the math like hmm my meal had this much calories and I burned this much then I don't think it helps with a diet and exercise it just tells you how much calories you burn with a serten exercise.",

Like how many calories i need a day, I wish I could just out that in myself, and also be able to change a serving and have options (e.g I wish I could log either 1/4, 1/2, 2/3 cups etc of a certain food. I can only change the amount I had by changing the units. That's much harder to calculate.) Idk, this is on the road to bring a great app. I would recommend letting the users have full control to customize it.",
            "Would be great to be able to copy a meal entry from another day to a new entry for ease and for the workouts done that day to reduce the calories added from your meals, so you know how many calories are left over. Would be nice to have a ML/oz, gram etc calculator. Thanks for the app as is however its really great. Best to your team. Maybe as well be able to add in more separate meals for those that eat 6 or 7 meals a day. As well a time stamp of when the meal/snack whatever was logged in. Thx!",

My account has now been charged and I am not happy and will not recommend this to others. I have emailed support three times and no one has answered me. And of coarse there is no phone number listed an anywhere for customer service. Can someone please help and refund me?",

            "I didnt know why i couldnt gain weight since i am currently 20lbs under a healthy bmi. I started using this calculator, it help me realize what i was eating was low in calories and how to do it healthily. My fiance now uses it too to pay more attention to his sugar intake. But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",
            "I have never left a review on an app before, but this one has improved my life so much I just had to :D It's the most user friendly calorie counter I've found, and I've stuck with it for the past three months. It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",
            "This app is easy to use and very accurate. But please make a weight GAIN version. People these days who need to lose weight already have plenty of ways to do it and plenty of people to go to. But gaining weight is not only harder than losing it, it's also WAY harder to find help with it.",

            "I am using the paid version and I love it! I love the reminders and the lessons. I especially love the recipes and the fact that you have a TON of vegetarian options. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that recipes get removed! I plan my meals a week in advance and I went today to prepare one and the 3 of the recipes are gone! There also isn't an option to download a .pdf to save for later. Please fix this and i will rate 5 stars!",
            "Great app. I've experimented with IF in the past, with great success. However, with COVID and working from home, it's a lot easier to slip up and eat whenever you want to. This app pops up periodically reminding me that I need to drink water. It's nice to have a reminder, which should prevent me from mindlessly eating when I'm not scheduled to. My first foray into IF was about 2 years ago, and I lost 85lbs in total. I'm not quite where I was before, but I'm still dealing with about 50 extra lbs. This app is highly recommended, as long as you use it as intended.",
            "Great app, takes a little learning. I was initially confused by the words encouraging me to 'End Fasting' when I was only hours into current fast. This resulted in a few badly timed fast records, but the ability to edit fasting start and end times saved me. I often forget to record my water intake, despite the much appreciated reminders from the app. The retroactive edit ability for water intake does not allow me to click on a day and edit. No response when I try to select a day's water record.",
            "Easy and Convenient app. I love that I can see my progress so easily!! I wish I could connect to my community though. It disappeared as quickly as it appeared???? I also wish I could communicate with my fasting buddies, at minimum send them an emoji or something. I use the paid version so I'm not sure what I'm getting that's any different than the free version... I don't use the recipes or the tools, I just use the trackers. All in all I'm happy I have the app though to stay on track.",
            "Love this app. I'm using the free version. There are enough features to get you started on IF. You enter basic info about yourself & they suggest a plan. You can modify the IF hours. Cool feature shows start/stop times. During fast you can see at a glance how long you've fasted/and time left. Reminders to drink water w/place to log amount. Didn't rate 5 stars because I wear an off brand fitness tracker (not listed on app) so steps are not recorded & no way to manually enter steps taken."

I'll have random days where my BFR jumps 5% in one day. And another annoying thing is that every second time I use it, it alerts me to make sure I'm on the right profile because the measurements are significantly different.

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

I only wish for a bit more analysis - like seeing an all-time graph with all data points instead of averages, and a filter too see on which days I put the \"alcohol\" stamp to see what effect it has on my weight.",
            "Only one minor flaw The app works perfectly, it let's you track daily your total weight, muscle mass, fat mass, waist, and add notes daily. It creates a graphic which you can visualize daily, weekly or monthly for each value. In muscle and fat mass it let's you input the values in percentage or kg (if it's metric), the issue here is that if you've been tracking your fat in kg, and you want to change it to percentage, the values remain the same and you have to change them manually and viceversa",
            "I enjoy using this app because it allows me to log my daily stats for weight, body fat, muscle, waist circumstance & additional notes. There are daily reminders to keep logging my stats & a graph (landscape view only) for comparison between days, weeks & months. Overall, I'd recommend this app to anyone trying to keep track of reaching a specified goal for your fitness journey or a healthier lifestyle.",

Easy to use, does not crash, no adds,.., and it gives you daily, weekly and monthly statistics of the values entered (weight, musc %, fat %) If i cuold add something to the app it would be the chance to log the visceral fat % and adding pictures to track the progress.",

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

            "It's really fun to mess around, but it gets bmis wrong. My bmi is around 25.61. When I put in my measurements it says I have a bmi of 57. Also I tried, and even the smallest person with the lowest weight would get you about 35. Which is obese. And if you look at the image, they're thinner than a stick. If the bmi was correct, then this would definitely earn 5 stars! Overall, good job! Edit: I have realised this problem only occurs on the imperial system, but the bmi is the same for both systems",
            "I like the fact that I can see my body shape without my face and skin tone. It helps me focus more on my weight and goals related to it. I wish that they had shoulder, bust, arm, and thigh measures though because it would be even more accurate to how I look. Even if they don't contribute to the calculations it'd be nice to have.",
            "Why are there limits on the numbers? I can't manually put numbers in and I cant make it go lower or higher than what you have. I was excited for this app. So letdown. Remove the limits",
            "Forcing you to use the free trial just to put in body measurements turned me off. I dont like putting credit card info for \"free\" trials because I know most businesses do this hoping many will forget to cancel, and that is how they make money ( like that gym membership that doesn't get used). Sorry, not worth it so uninstalling.",
            "Honestly i cant even begin to use this even with pro. It assumes my starting waist size is 60cm higher than it is, my hips 40cm larger, neck 10cm larger. It says to go pro to make it more accurate but it just made me immensely frustrated because i want an app like this i just want one that actually allows customization of the 3d model with my actual measurements. Also i think a section adding in for chest would be helpful for others like me who carry a lot of weight in their chests (cnd 34F)"

A healthy BMI score is between 20 and 25. A score below 20 indicates that you may be underweight; a value above 25 indicates that you may be overweight.\r\n\r\nBasal Metabolic Rate (BMR):\r\nYou use energy no matter what you're doing, even when sleeping. The BMR Calculator will calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR); the number of calories you'd burn if you stayed in bed all day.\r\n\r\nIf you've noticed that every year, it becomes harder to eat whatever you want and stay slim, you've also learnt that your BMR decreases as you age. Likewise, depriving yourself of food in hopes of losing weight also decreases your BMR, a foil to your intentions. However, a regular routine of cardiovascular exercise can increase your BMR, improving your health and fitness when your body's ability to burn energy gradually slows down.\r\n\r\nBody Fat Calculation (BFC):\r\nHow much Body Fat are you carrying? Find out if you are in the healthy range. This Body Fat calculator is based on a formula developed by the US Navy.\r\n\r\nFirst, your body fat percentage is simply the percentage of fat your body contains. If you weigh 140 pounds and are 10% fat, it means that your body consists of 14 pounds fat and 126 pounds lean body mass (bone, muscle, organ tissue, blood,...).\r\n\r\nA certain amount of fat is essential to bodily functions. Fat regulates body temperature, cushions and insulates organs and tissues and is the main form of the body's energy storage. Check out this Body Fat Chart which describes fat ranges and their associated categories.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarris Benedict Equation (HBE):\r\nThe Harris Benedict Equation is a formula that uses your BMR and then applies an activity factor to determine your total daily energy expenditure (calories). The only factor omitted by the Harris Benedict Equation is lean body mass. Remember, leaner bodies need more calories than less leaner ones. Therefore, this equation will be very accurate in all but the very muscular (will under-estimate calorie needs) and the very fat (will over-estimate calorie needs).\r\n\r\nFirst, determine your BMR using our BMR Calculator or our BMR Formula.\r\n\r\nPlease remember, however, that this is only one of many possible ways to assess your weight. If you have any concerns about your weight, please discuss them with your physician, who is in a position, unlike this BMI calculator, to address your specific individual situation.\r\n\r\nGreat Resources:\r\nhttp://www.shakesandsmoothies.com\r\nhttp://www.healthfitnessenergy.com",

            "I've been using the scale and app for over a year. It was great until recently. Now, the app never syncs with scale. I'll have the app open, right next to me and nothing. I try to drag down to see if I can get it to refresh, nothing. What's the point of having a fancy scale if you can't get the info??? Also, doesn't stay connected to Fitbit. Always having to resync. Fix it please!",
            "It's great data points. Would love to give it 5 stars the only issue I have with this app is the lack of \"edit options\" and the difficulty in setting manual data like measurements and dates and times. Would be much better to not have to scroll so much. I'm confused on some of the stats and would love a link to a short YouTube video explaining what the term literally means, how it's used to help me in goal setting and why I should care for the term and it's values according to my health.",
            "Great app. One thing missing though, is the ability to take and link photos with each weigh in, similar to MyFitnessPal app. It would be great to be able to save a photo with each weight measurement and then compare or see a timeline over a period of time. Otherwise, very happy with the scale and the app.",
            "The first display as you get off the scale is beautifully laid out and very easy to read. The trend page is confusing bc you have red to. Go to the measurements page to add as any info. Should be able to get there from the trends page too by clicking the items but at least you can get there. Still exploring around but I love having the information.",
            "I've seen this suggestion a couple times before, but the thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is the manual input for weight. I have two years worth of weight I wanna input. First issue is, as another user mentioned, how tedious it is to scroll through each date since the month and year is attached to the day. Please separate out the year, month, and day. This is most important. Second would be if there was some better interface to add multiple manual weight inputs at once. 5star when fixed"

            "Use to love this app but not they are charging for it, which blows my mind, how can you charge some one for trying to lose weight this really upsets me",
            "Very bad ,why u guys charging???there are so many app who gives free...so why we should use ur apps by paying?? disgusting",
            "I am flatfooted, but young. I liked the exercises. This is the only workout app that doesn't make my feet hurt. My weakness is my lower body, otherwise my upper body and abs can work miracles. I can do like 300 situps, without resting and can do at least 30 pushups, but I liked this app the best, because all the exercises, including the lower body are easier than on other apps. I wish this was all workouts for free. Yeah and also liked the fact that there's some kind of boxing and kicking too.",
            "This was my first evening in over a year of trying to increase my physical activity level by exercising. I have some physical ailments that I exasperate by pushing myself to exercise beyond my comfort level, but the exercises in this app were simple and accommodated the beginner. Also, I'm learning to stop/modify if an exercise causes a painful strain. The animation, the descriptions and the exercise demonstrations made it easy to follow and keep up. I will definitely continue to use the app."

Now I have to spend extra money to buy a new scale that will connect directly through the regular WW app.",
            "This app is useless. It won't connect to the scale because every time it asks for permission to turn Bluetooth on and off, I select \"yes\" and it turns off Bluetooth then gets stuck in a loop where it keeps requesting the same permission and I keep selecting \"yes\". I tried multiple restarts and reinstalls to no avail. Don't waste your time.",
            "It used to be great. I had this scale and App for about 2 years and loved it. Loved that in app I could see progress. Loved that it synced to WW app which is why I invested $59.00 on a scale. Suddenly this morning it won't connect to Bluetooth and sync to my app. I followed all the trouble shooting prompts. Uninstalled app and reinstalled now I can't even get into the app. It won't allow me to log on. Apparently they updated this rendering it entirely useless. Conair/WW need to get it together",
            "I purchased this particular scale by Conair because of ours ability to connect to the WW app. I purchased the scale on April 17, 2020 and I've only been able to connect to my app 2 times. Each time I try to connect to Bluetooth I get an error message. Wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this scale. It's useless and I'm sending it back.",
            "Okay, I take it back. I got lucky that it worked once. I'm not sure though if its all the apps fault. The scale has its issues too. I'm user 3 on the scale and my wife is 2 & son is 4. User 3&4 are no longer visible to weigh in with. Sending the scale back and getting rid of app. I bought the scale for the WW and Bluetooth features."

When selecting your activity level use:\r\n\r\n   ‚Ä¢ Sedentary (little or no exercise)\r\n   ‚Ä¢ Lightly Active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week)\r\n   ‚Ä¢ Moderately Active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week)\r\n   ‚Ä¢ Vigorously Active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week)\r\n   ‚Ä¢ Extremely Active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training)\r\n\r\n     This is referred to as your basal metabolic rate or BMR calculation and tells you: How Many Calories Do I Burn a Day?\r\n\r\n‚òÖ BFP - Body Fat Percentage: of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass; body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential body fat is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions. The percentage of essential body fat for women is greater than that for men, due to the demands of childbearing and other hormonal functions. The percentage of essential fat is 2‚Äì5% in men, and 10‚Äì13% in women (referenced through NASM).\r\n\r\n‚òÖ WHtR - Waist-to-Height Ratio: also called waist-to-stature ratio (WSR), is defined as the waist circumference divided by the height. It measures abdominal obesity and therefore can be used as a better indicator of health risks than BMI (Body Mass Index).\r\n\r\n‚òÖ WHR - Waist-to-Hip Ratio: is the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W √∑ H). The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. WHR correlates with fertility (with different optimal values for males and females).\r\n\r\n More information about BMI, WHtR and WHR classification which is used by this calculator is available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website.\r\n\r\nPlease rate us with ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ if you like our app!\r\n\r\nCompliment, problems or criticism with this app?

When selecting your activity level use:<br><br>   ‚Ä¢ Sedentary (little or no exercise)<br>   ‚Ä¢ Lightly Active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week)<br>   ‚Ä¢ Moderately Active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week)<br>   ‚Ä¢ Vigorously Active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week)<br>   ‚Ä¢ Extremely Active (very hard exercise/sports &amp; physical job or 2x training)<br><br>     This is referred to as your basal metabolic rate or BMR calculation and tells you: How Many Calories Do I Burn a Day?<br><br>‚òÖ BFP - Body Fat Percentage: of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass; body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential body fat is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions. The percentage of essential body fat for women is greater than that for men, due to the demands of childbearing and other hormonal functions. The percentage of essential fat is 2‚Äì5% in men, and 10‚Äì13% in women (referenced through NASM).<br><br>‚òÖ WHtR - Waist-to-Height Ratio: also called waist-to-stature ratio (WSR), is defined as the waist circumference divided by the height. It measures abdominal obesity and therefore can be used as a better indicator of health risks than BMI (Body Mass Index).<br><br>‚òÖ WHR - Waist-to-Hip Ratio: is the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W √∑ H). The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. WHR correlates with fertility (with different optimal values for males and females).<br><br> More information about BMI, WHtR and WHR classification which is used by this calculator is available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website.<br><br>Please rate us with ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ if you like our app!<br><br>Compliment, problems or criticism with this app?

            "Too much ads, I like the app in that it's strait forward and easy to use and understand, but now when I open the app, there is a BIG AD that's like IN YOUR FACE, that's truly uncool. I like this app enough that I'd pay for a pro version without any ads if the price was right. (Hint hint, maybe one for the suggestion box to the dev's). If not for the ads, I'd give this 4 and half stars",
            "OK but the ad on entry gets tedious and annoying. Some additions would be welcomed- like the option to add blood pressure, pulse rate and irregular rythym markers. It would put most of the common health measurements in one handy place and I would think diabetics would benefit from blood sugar level too. But overall it does the things that are needed for this kind of app and connection seems reliable, so thanks. But please consider extending its functionality as described above.",
            "The app finally works, but when I try to change something, like target weight, picture or add another user, there's an error message: \"you don't have a network connection\". Tried wifi and mobile data, restart, cleaning cache. Still doesn't work.",
            "Terrible big ad at startup and small ads in app itself. Have to disconnect from internet to get rid of the ads... Scale doesn't feel that strong, but app is great. Connect easily and quick. Give a lot of data. Supports multiple users, even guest. Generates graphs and contains a small help of every measured item.",
            "Earlier my biggest concerm with the app was the fact that the app which main feature was connecting to the scale via bluetooth was demanding permission to know phone's geolocation. Today the application updated and now it simply crashes immediately after startup. Keep up the good work, guys"

            "The app is easy to use, and provides copious workout regimens that can easily be altered to match your personal needs based on exercise comfort level and equipment access. Best geared towards people with a little experience(you should consult a personal trainer if you don't have experience anyways). My only complaint would be that timed exercises like planks can't currently use the same in app timer that is utilized for rest between sets, or at least I haven't figured that one out yet.",
            "5 Stars to 1 Star. I purchased this subscription and have an issue with account recovery. I purchased a new phone and submitted a request to recover my account and there is a 72 hour wait time in which I'm on day 4 with no response. I requested a refund and google notified me that they are unable to provide one. I do not recommend this app for fitness goals or a subscription for the issue above. You lose your phone or get a new one they will not recover your account info.",
            "Overall I like the app and the ease of use. I wish it was easier to change dates for workouts. If you forget to \"finish workout\" it caries all those exercises over to the next day. Also if you are loading your own workout it would be helpful to be able to load them in advance as opposed to the day of the workout.",
            "Good for where it is thus far. Needs same features as iOS. Like that it builds routines for you and that you can add what equip you already have. Needs the ability to say what weights you have, but how many. would also like the ability for the program to show.me what weights I need to add to my bar so I don't have to think. Lastly, need to be able save workouts you've completed for future workouts.",
            "I really like actual 'guts' of the app. Nice selection of exercises. Good video and instructions. It increments the workouts as you go along. The muscle recovery is very handy. The GUI needs work. I would like to be able to see the muscle recovery percentages on the graphic showing the muscles. The android app needs as much love as the IOS. Please provide some integration with Google Fit or Samsung Health. It would also be nice to have a button to regenerate your next workout."

        "description": "7 days of diet plan in Telugu\r\nThis is a very tough diet\r\nDiet with fruits and vegetables\r\nBut the cost-effective diet\r\n\r\nThe degree to which a person is overweight is generally described by the body mass index (BMI). Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, thus it includes pre-obesity defined as a BMI between 25 and 30 and obesity as defined by a BMI of 30 or more.\r\n\r\nThe body mass index (BMI) is a measure of a person's weight taking into account their height. It is given by the following formula: BMI equals a person's weight (mass) in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in meters.

            "Incredibly wrong and even when converting from kg to lbs it's still wrong. There's no finger scanner to find out your weight either. Whoever said this is a good app must work for the company. I tried to put in that I'm 5'2\" tall and it wouldn't let me. So I thought I had to convert the measurements. So I did and it still have me incredibly inaccurate weights. Completely a waste of time for anyone!!",

Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",

            "Works great. Takes a bit of time to learn to navigate the app. Surprised at the number of vegan recipes available. Some food were incorrectly inputted so I sent a report and also updated what I have. I wish you could update the info yourself. Also, I wish there was more flexibility with the intermitten fasting time. Overall, happy and hopeful it will help me achieve my weight loss goal.",
            "I've been using this app for quite a few years and it is pretty decent. However, I was quite disappointed that the search option for one's own foods was removed; now one has to scroll endlessly until they find the food they are looking for. Furthermore, I would suggest adding a meal prep feature where one inputs the nutrition details for what one eats, but then the actual calories and stuff is only added to the daily counter once it has been eaten(a check off system).",
            "I really love how many options of food there are, I can always find the exact thing I've eaten on here and how much I had. The only thing I don't really like is the feature connecting the app with a step counter app like Google fit, it doesn't really seem to work properly and update my steps so I've started just adding them in manually. Aside from that it does all I need.",
            "When you search food it doesn't have as many options as I would like, such as restaurants. It might have one calorie count for something and the one below it is completely different. It's hard to know what's right or wrong. You can add them in but I don't want to do that every time so I feel like I am guessing. I wish it would have things set as peice or amount. It reminds you frequently to log info and encourages you which I like, and has a lot of meal options. The meal calorie count is nice.",
            "I'm using it to track my dietary supplements, it's pretty straight forward, and you can add your own foods (like your mom's recipe and stuff). I wish I could be more precise with the measurements (Adding Vitamin D in milligrams is pretty useless, for example) and that it accepted more nutrients (my supplement has a ton of vitamins and minerals, and it would be nice to track those. I wish I knew an app that could approximately the micronutrients content of my mom's recipe too...)"

I hope I can find a workable app, this scores zero stars, it's literally a non starter.",

You should also add a hospital in case something happens to you so you at least have a chance of living rather than just dying and having to start over again. I really hope you consider my ideas!",

Also, the fact that the graph resizes based on weight history is good, but the way it was done does not look very good.  Password is useless as an option, horrible as a requirement.. If someone is on my phone we already have a bigger problem than how much I weigh. The only thing I need want a second password for after you get past my lockscreen is my banking apps.",

It would be great if it could also display 7 and 30 day averages for your daily expenditure along with the yearly and overall averages as well. Also, having the expenditure numbers display in red or green, depending on a negative expenditure or a positive expenditure would be a great add as well. Thx.",

Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq üôèüôè",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",

The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I had the old app when I was on maternity leave with my first child and it was great. Unfortunately the new app is really clunky,, it freezes constantly, takes ages to update any changes to the weekly menu and has the wrong amount of ingredients for serving size. It will say 1 serve but then the amount of ingredients will be for 4 serves. I have to up the amount of serves then decrease it again to get the right info. It's just a really buggy app but has the potential to be great.",
            "Needs a bit more work. freezes, records workouts then they disappear from your daily records other times after the work out it doesn't come up to record your workout. A little frustrating at times to keep an accurate record. Recording food is a little behind, would be nice if it remembers your food from previous to record quicker and don't have to type each day",
            "Was a great app, just a few issues now, have to log in everytime I go on it, now everytime I do log in it won't let me log any water or food until I have clicked on the diamond rewards blinking thing, i have read it all once, I shouldn't have to go into it every time before logging anything, also my fitbit keeps un-sincing from the app now..",
            "Well I have only being using this healthy mummy app for about 3 days and I am loving it so is my partner we didn't really no something could be so easy and simple to use and follow the healthy mummy recipes and all the information you get on the side is amazing there's been a lot of work put into this and you can see it I would give it a rating at 100 stars if there was any and this app just makes it so much more easier because you can save your favorite recipes to. Thanks healthy mummy.",
            "It is awesome for the recipe ideas which is mainly what I got it for, but it logs me out often and my previous tracking and \"diamond awards\" resets back to zero and it can't be a bit discouraging seeing everything reset. If you want this for Recipe ideas I recommend getting it but definitely has some bugs to work out"

            "Great app. I waited till after I was done with the 21 day challenge to review. I did the challenge everyday and I did this with 5 bottles of water and intermittent fasting as well. After the 3rd week I added 35 to 45 min of treadmill and very light lifting 3x a week. I've only been on the scale once. So far I've been feeling amazing no more bloating. My family has noticed my weight loss. I've lost 5 lbs. It's not much but it's a start. Love the app!",
            "I absolutely love this app. During the pandemic I started to gain so much weight and felt so bad about myself. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I decided to change this. Combined with a healthy diet, this app has helped lose around 9 lbs in 3 to 4 weeks. I enjoy the training, the workouts...everything. I personally don't like to exercise much, but I feel pretty motivated to keep doing these workouts everyday, so, thanks for that! Looking forward to keep using this app ‚ô°.",
            "The workouts themselves are easy to follow and you can change your rest time in between to suit your needs while also being able to skip an exercise or pause anytime you'd like. I've not used those functions yet as I haven't felt I needed to. It keeps a great pace and I feel like I've done a nice workout. I'm not sure how the calories burned add up though. Of you're really working hard it might be correct? I like to do the daily workout and then an another one as well since they're short and sw",
            "I've been using for a couple weeks and I really like how simple and easy this app is...gives me no excuse not to work out bc most workouts are just 10mins! I am doing the full body 28 day challenge and it's actually really enjoyable. I feel good after the work out and want to do at least one more. Really enjoyable women's fitness app. Not to much and not to little. Just right for this mom. üíÉ",

It keeps up with your workouts, your diet, and let's you pick what part of your body you want to exercise with or just stretch. It does a lot for you and gives you reminders for when to work out.

            "It's a great program that provides results even if you don't have 100% adherence! (Though much better results if you do, of course). The update that just came out in Oct. 2020 has caused some growing pains as new features are integrated and kinks are ironed out, but the dev team seems to be working hard to fix issues asap. I see no reason for the hissy fits some people are throwing about slight delays in waiting for the app stores to approve the updates. Very glad I got this app!",
            "I loved the old version but the new version I just downloaded on the 10/22/20 is very confusing. For example it says I go to bed at 2100 and wake up to eat at 2330? I am having a really hard time with this.",
            "App has again been updated and is working as it should.",
            "So I'm paying $15 / month for a diet app that won't let me start a fat loss diet. Their support desks solution was wait for the update after next! Thanks for being patient! Translation: you're a sucker",
            "Please add mini cut cycle. Also the day is starting from midnight and the last meal is carrying over to the next day. That's kind of weird."

Meal plan is..needs work. It's free and cheap but come on, not including healthy fats neglects reproductive health, brain power & fat is needed to burn fat. Some are 'fat burning' foods but is imbalanced w/out the actual fat. Oatmeal is not a thing to have everyday. This diet requires many tears at night."
