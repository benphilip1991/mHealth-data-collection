            "It's simple and easy to use. You can choose how often it reminds you to drink water (30min, 1hr, 2hrs) and a time frame so it won't disturb you overnight. When you add water, you choose how many ounces you drank by scrolling for or typing in the #. My favorite part is this horizonal bar & a face that lets you know how you're doing throughout the day. So you can see if you're falling behind. 5 stars all the way!",
            "OMG... This is one of the best water drinking reminder app ever. You can just enter your weight and it will tell you how much water you need to consume a day.It gives you reminders according to your wakeup time and bedtime. You can also customize this. It gives you reminders between the time that you want. Like, you can choose 1 or 2 hrs. Easy.... Really loved this app and will definitely recommend it to you.",
            "This app is the best. It has everything I was looking for a very long time. It let's me pick how much water I want do drink in a day and keeps a graph of how much water I've drank in a week. It gives simple reminders and best of all it's all FREE!",
            "It really helps me know how much I'm drinking and reminds me I gotta drink more. Its an amazing app that's really helped me. Because I forget to drink and since had this app I haven't really forgotten I love it. Thank you for making such a great useful app. 😊😊😊",
            "This water tracker is sorta easy to figure out, but some popup tips the first time would be good so user doesn't have to spend the effort figuring out how to enter drinks, correct entries, and add entries. I am glad I can do the second and third of those actions , but they weren't obvious."

            "Wonderful, wonderful app. Only two complaints that they might be working on fixing. One, it doesn't tell you how much you should be at currently, it just shows consumption, total, and then a little arrow at your current objective. Would be nice to see your current objective number of ounces. Second, the logging for type of drink is a little clunky. Would be nice to hold down the 'plus' button, and then drag my finger to the choice. I press the plus button all the time with the wrong drink.",
            "An excellent app. Hypothetically my kidneys owe to this app. In the last 1.5 yrs, whatever water I drank, I can clearly attribute 80% of that success to this app. I forget drinking water. Even after working whole day and running 3 KMs later, I don't feel thirsty. Though I don't feel like drinking but my body clearly shows me that it is not happy by the color of waste that comes out. Since using this app, I have changed that. There is only so much an app can do. Rest is in our own hands.",
            "It's an alright app. Does what it says on the tin. The thing is it says it shares your data with other sites for ads and promotions but you can turn that off if you want. I've tried turning it off 4 times but it doesn't work. You can click \"I do not agree\" but it just puts it back to agree. Can this be fixed?",
            "Fantastic reminder! It's very simple and easy to use. I love that I can change the amount of ounces and the time that I need to be reminded. Very user-friendly! Since using this app has done a great job of keeping up with my intake of water as I begin the process of losing weight. If I have a headache I simply drink enough water in that headache goes away. It's kept me from being dehydrated. I love it!",
            "I would love it, if it actually did it's job. It reminds me to drink water for about 2 days then just stops sending notifications all together. I have to open the app and add water for it to start reminding me again. But it inevitably stops after a day. I regret purchasing this app, and will look for another. Also, it does NOT allow me to add water from my watch."

            "This app just doesn't work on my Samsung. First of all the reminder sound which is arguably the most important feature of an app like this just doesn't work. It is too quiet; with my volume turned all the way up in a silent room I can barely hear it. Even if the sound wasn't too quiet the reminder never appears despite following the instructions provided if the app doesn't work. And in the few hours I've had it installed the app has used a lot if battery. So disappointing.",
            "I was on healthify and other water drinking apps but none of them worked for me. It become annoying at a point that I had to uninstall. However I tried Water reminder app and this by far is the best app I've come across. Not only does it make it cool by reminding exactly how much water we need in a day but also the reminder and tips that come with it are you extremely cool. I'm hooked and it's just day one. Thank you so much for the creators of this application. You've done an amazing job!!",
            "Amazing app!! I tend to forget drinking water when I am working for long hours. This app has a default time to time reminder as per your hydration goals which are also customizable if you want. You can also setup the quantity of water as per the vessel you have. It is very helpful. Water helps remove toxins from the body and is absolutely essential for a healthy body. This is a great app. Kudos to the creators.",
            "App is perfect! Will definately stay hydrated from now on. It's not just an option for me so I have to have something reliable. Pop up makes it very easy to see when to drink and once you finish your glass you just hit the Full Glass and it closes until the next time you're supposed to drink. You log in weight, wake time, sleep time, when you first begin using and it automatically calculates glasses of water needed and divides it up for you during the hours your awake.",
            "I really appreciate this app and it reminds me to drink the necessary amount of water in this covid season. Lazy to sanitise my hands and remove my mask, I stopped drinking water for long hours. But this app gently reminds me to excuse myself and drink adequately at necessary intervals. Love the mild notification sound too."

            "The notifications for this app use the media volume on phone instead of the notification volume. If this cannot be changed, it makes the app useless to me. If that one thing were resolved, it would be a 5* app. Edit: since dev replied. Currently Using Android v10, Samsung s20. Years ago, I Used this app on an s5 on android 6.01 and this was not the case. I have already paid for premium version, as I have gotten tons of utility out of app already. If this one issue can be resolved easy 5 star",

            "Fantastic UI. Ability to add custom hydration types is much appreciated. Only bug so far involves a duplication of the hydration factor when syncing to Fitbit. For example, if I log a 250ml drink using the milk factor (120%), it will first appear as \"300ml (120% of 250ml)\", but after a couple of seconds, it changes to \"360ml (120% of 300ml)\" and \"(Fitbit)\" is added to the name of the log. For now, I can mitigate this by using a custom factor, but a fix would be much appreciated. Thanks :D",
            "Nice way to keep me motivated to stay hydrated. I got pro as well to support the dev. I'd just like to request something. Sometimes, I press the wrong amount of water from the notification reminder or the app itself. I can delete it, yes. But the deleted option still gets recorded in the stats. I hope it gets deleted as well for accuracy. Thank you! Will change to 5 stars when this gets fixed!",
            "Best hydration app I've tried! I love this app. Been using it for about a week and it has everything I need: it logs drinks with time, it shows you in a really handy interface how much water you've drank, how much is left and where on the scale you are currently. Drink reminders work well. It also gamifies your intake a little for more incentive to stay hydrated. Highly recommended if you need to keep up with your fluid intake.",
            "Just went from 5 stars to 3 stars. Got to level 5 with 75 days total then it dropped most of my data, and started me back at level 1! I'll have to get a new water app. now. Heard back from the dev. problem is.... the Hydrillo app. only remembers up to level 4 with 2 more days remaining for level 5, to bad, if this sort of thing keeps happening, I'll need to get a new water app.",
            "I like it so far, some health errors. As in a powerlifter like me drinks 2 gallons of water a day to make sure I'm flushing my system of excess proteins - I found the math it uses says I need much less than what I've been needing. HOWEVER, it does allow you to do custom volumes of water for intake goals 💯💯. The ability to connect to MyFitnessPal and other capable dieting apps would be a great feature. And lastly. But not required - the ability to change the secondary color of the app."

            "So far the experience has been very positive. The reminders are much more constant compared to other apps (which i like since i forget to drink water easily) and being able to select diferent kinds of beverages is a huge plus.",
            "Good design, easy to use, good challenges, BUT after a while it becomes slow day by day and you have to clear all the data",
            "After a while, it is getting slower. Enter your drink, wait for the sum to update, wait for the next drink time to update, wait for the animation. Wonder what it's doing. Edit: Reinstalling fixed the lag at the cost of all records. A pity, but those records are of little consequence anyway. Next time I will try to just clear all data from the settings, maybe that will have the same effect. Edit 2: Using it for a few more months and the slowness is back. So it's time for a new flush. Bye badges",
            "So far I've been really happy with this app and may consider the purchase upgrade if I find I stick with logging my fluid intake. My kidneys are currently thanking me as I've never drank so much water on a daily basis as I have in the past 5 days. With this app, I find I often drink my intake before required but on the occasion I got behind in my schedule... I really appreciated the app's reminder. Update 9/9/2020. I use this app every day. I always meet my goals. May actually become a habit!",
            "Great app with nice graphics. It's satisfying for me to drink more than 5 glass of water per day. With help of this app now i am drinking 10-12 glass of water and i like it. Challenges feature of this app is also a great tool to stay on your target."

            "Outstanding mind-blowing app. Best water 💦 reminder app ever. Pros : + No ads which is major positive + Smart settings based on your health + Star ⭐ membership is very affordable prices. Cons : they aren't so highly recommended Also please don't make any changes for this beautiful app please.",
            "I was not satisfied with my current water reminder app so I downloaded this app and I am very happy with it. It has not even been one day but I can already see that it has all the information that I needed in a water reminder app. Highly recommended.",
            "The app is easy to use, but the 5 star rating comes strictly from the adorable emoji that asked me for it, after mentioning I had been using the app for a few days and still haven't given a rating."

Widget has several options to customise :) -easy to use, customise cup size, daily goal.. can also have \"standard\" goals based on gender, weight, active lifestyle -achievements for motivation Suits me very well :) Would love integration to GoogleFit or MyFitnessPal :)",

The notification helpfully has the ability to add water from the pop up, but I wish it wouldn't open the app up automatically when you click it. It would make things easier if you could just add water from the notification when it comes up, then continue without interruption. but besides that, it's useful and practical.",
            "Good, helps and always reminds me to drink water. I do have a suggestion for the widgets though, can you make them add an amount of water to your daily goal without opening the app? The widgets are kind of just a display of your intakes but isn't really that functional. Also please make it able to write your water intake the previous days, because I just installed the app but it doesn't let me because I have not installed the app in those days yet.",

            "Water health is an awesome tool for me to take care of my water intake on daily basis. I recommended the same to all of my family members. Most of them will be onboard soon too. The best part is the reminders and current status of daily water intake. Very useful for people suffering from Kidney stones.",
            "I like how you can tweak its settings. I just don't agree to the computation of water requirements daily because my formula is 50ml x kg = total required water per day. But I still thank you for creating the app because it helps me monitor my water intake progress.",
            "I like this app. I wanted to keep track of my water intake and this is perfect for me. The only downside is the ads but it's not super in your face about it. So I would recommend using this app, if you want to keep track of your water intake.",
            "Simple and easy to use. Perfect for making sure you are drinking enough water daily. It bases your intake goal on weight, activity, and weather/temp. or you can set you own goals as well."

This app also adds the amount of water extra you need if u are a sports person It also shows u the chart of how well u are doing, basically you have to get 100 bit I get 500, which is amazin PLS DOWNLOAD",

I was thinking of buying a water bottle with the hour reminder marks on it, but I already have sooo many nice water tumblers so I didn't want to spend the extra money. This app allows me to create my own reminder schedule. I set it to remind me every 1/2 hour. I'd definitely recommend it to others.",

Fairly cute without getting cloying or \"overcrowded\". Reminders work nicely and avoid being obtrusive and annoying. The one star got taken off because I had to reset the reminders (they got switched off by themselves, no clue how or why) - but it's only happened once so far.",
            "I love this app from first sight ❤❤ My fish is adorable and really gives me the motivation to drink. All in all I do have a recommendation to the developer that you should allow user to set their goal instead of set it yourself based on weight. I have to set my weight to 100 because that's when the goal is set to my liking.",
            "The app is cute and had a clean UI. It's not as confusing as other Water Reminder app. The sugar intake counter too is appreciable but I suggest if the developer puts a calorie counter then it would be more compact. Overall, it's a great app.",
            "Cute and nice! The fish are so adorable. Their cuteness makes me push myself to drink more water so they don't get pale. Your app is sooo well created but i would like to suggest some ideas that i have. It would be nice if i can save my customized volume and if i can have a second fish as a companion for my lovely one in the aquarium. Finally, If i can start with baby fish, take care of them and watch them grow together with my water drinking habit, it would be soooo wonderful.",

            "I like this app because I can go back and show my husband and doctors how much water I am taking in and in what \"form\" (coffee, tea, etc). The only thing that I really don't like is that I want to 'Go Pro' and it lists the price but not how often needs to be paid. Is it weekly? Monthly? 'Yearly'? Frustrating.",
            "The app is very intuitive, and there's a lot of great features that help you keep track of your water usage. 10 out of 10 would recommend, just for the health usage. One thing I would like to see is the integration for me to use this with my iOS phone as well, with my premium features without buying another one. But I'm just nitpicking at this point.",
            "I bought this app because I loved it, but some glitch has happened. I've been meeting my target of 3 litres a day for almost 200 days straight. All of a sudden, a random two days are in red. When I view them in my diary, it shows I've surpassed the amount I should have. But in the statistics, it's red and shows it happens. I had to go to those two days and add two more litres each just to fix my statistics. I don't know why this happened. The diary doesn't match the statistics.",
            "I like this app because unlike other water reminder I used to use , there are more features for tracking and reminding. But what actually made use this app is the feature where you can challenge your friends and family on daily intake of water with help of a dashboard. Happy with the app",
            "used to work correctly and now I have a completely white field in the constant notification upd: thanks for answering. I stopped using it for a day and put it back, now it's working again. but I will send an email with the screenshot nevertheless."

            "Well its been a little over 36 hours and I don't enjoy this app. The first 16 hours it was great! Reminded me to drink every 2 hours. I've been awake since 07:00, and not once have I been reminded to drink. So I'm deleting this and will find a hopefully better app to remind me. I lead a super busy life and the reminders are so welcomed and I was beyond excited at first that this app delivered said reminders. Sad it didn't work out.",
            "Really good app it reminds me to drink as I tend not to drink a lot during the day ,its made me realised that yes I do need to ,dry skin headaches and also you can get water infection by not drinking enough , so I use the alarm on here ,which you can set yourself as to when you need to drink fluid. So yes good app",
            "So downloaded the app to track what I drink and different sorts. However after 1 day I've noticed that the main page doesn't tally the quantity properly. Ive been drinking in rounded amounts 250 or 500ml but its telling me I have drank 2253ml out of 2500ml, however I've actually drank 3000ml (4x250ml and 4x500ml). Yet the graph is correct. Think this needs to be addressed. However i do like that i can log different drinks",
            "Brilliant app, I always put this one on my phone, it's surprising how much better you feel when taking in the correct amount of water.😁",
            "This app is just what I needed. Due to medical issues, sometimes I don't feel thirsty even when I'm having other symptoms of dehydration, but this app will help me to drink enough fluids throughout the day."

            "This app is very productive and it has helped me maintain my drinking of water, it is a great app!!😘 I just feel like it could atleast notify me with a sound when the time to drink arrives because we are busy human beings atleast a beep sound will make me stop what I am doing and remember I have to drink water, besides that it's a good app and thanks for reminding me the importance of drinking water you deserve 5 stars because I feel hydrated👌",
            "It really works. It keeps me constant and I don't fall off of drinking my 8 cups of water a day. My skin has also started clearing up on my face and I have a much better immune system now. Lots of pros if you buy this app. I haven't had any issues that needed resolving. I would recommend!😁",
            "Excellent app, does exactly what it's set out to do and does wonders for your water drinking habits. I had to remove 1 star however, as it doesn't have any vibration notification options and sometimes presents a delay when you record a drink. Ps. There's a small grammatical error in the main menu ('you've stay hydrated).",
            "This app it a really good reminder of I must take my water in 500ml that's what I chose even when I wake up, I think of taking my water I love it's reminder that I must drink water . It's really nice I cannot delete this app. It has made me kept me motivated all time long .",
            "Nice app, would rather have a push notification at tge right time rather than a constant message on the notification bar, as if I don't check my phone I might miss it. Also, if I reach the goal I do not want to see notification anymore, while even when selecting that option, I do. But overall, good to use."

There is an option to customize the water intake goal, but it's grayed out and I can't adjust it. I'm guessing you have to buy the ad free version to access that? The concept is cute, but this app isn't worth it if it isn't giving me an accurate goal and won't let me set what I actually need.",

I enjoy the inspiring image of a body filling up with water as you add ounces, and how confetti goes flying every time you add towards reaching your goal. There's also notifications you can set to remind yourself every hour on the hour to drink water. I'm trying the free 7 day trial, then I'll likely pay for continued full use. Good job for the visually appealing and motivational app.",
            "Update 7/21/19 I used to love this app. After the upgrade it doesn't work though. Paid for the \"life time ad removal\" years ago when I first got the app. With the upgrade it doesn't register I've paid. June 30th I emailed them to let them know about the problem. Got emailed back to use \"restore\" button, which did nothing. I let them know. Got a reply to be on for a 5 min time frame to \"purchase for free\" at a time I didn't see email. Have emailed several times since with no reply or fix.",

Compared to fasting \"cleanse\" diets and those that restrict caloric intake, such as the Rice Diet, the Water Diet doesn't limit food consumption, nor does it require exercise. The appeal of the Water Diet is that dieters can purportedly eat what they want--and still lose weight.\r\n\r\nThe exact origin of the Water Diet is unknown.

The body burns extra calories heating up ice-cold water to the normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees. (The colder the water the more calories burned).\r\n\r\nHow the Diet Works\r\nOn the Water Diet, the dieter drinks 64 oz. of cool or cold water in eight 8-oz. servings over the course of the day, with or without meals, in addition to the dieter's normal fluid intake. The water can be tap water, bottled water or any other kind of water that is safe to drink. The available resources on the Water Diet discourages chewing on ice cubes to make up for water intake.

None of which are 20oz or below. One size is 24oz; the other 32oz. I have multiple of each size. I will not be buying any 20oz bottle(s) to comply with this restrictive function of the app. I may delete it, if I get too irritated with having to make more than one entry per finished water bottle. Lame.",

I would give 5 stars but the notifications are every 2 hours which I believe is far too long in between each drink (for me) to be able to get in all 2+ltrs per day and there's no option to change it. The notifications are also silent! That is pointless for me if I dont have my phone in my hand at the time. It would be great to have the option to change settings for notofications - some more variations would take this to a 5 star rating. X",

        "description": "*This app is way cooler when paired with your HidrateSpark smart water bottle*\r\nWhy keep track of your water intake manually when your water bottle can do it for you?\r\n\r\nWe all know drinking water is important but millions of us don’t get enough to drink each day, because it’s so easy to forget and hard to track, especially in our busy lives. Hidrate Spark is here to change that and make dehydration a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nHIDRATESPARK SMART WATER BOTTLE GLOWS\r\nHidrateSpark is a smart water bottle that automatically tracks how much water you drink and syncs with this app via bluetooth. This bottle will even glow from within when you need to drink more water.\r\n\r\nHYDRATION HISTORY\r\nSee your hydration progress over time in a daily, weekly, and monthly view. How many days in a row can you reach your goal?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMIZED DAILY GOAL\r\nThe app calculates a recommended hydration goal based on your personal parameters such as age, height, weight and gender. It can even use your location to determine the temperature, humidity and elevation of your surroundings to make sure your goal is customized specifically to you. You can also manually set your goal for health reasons if you’d like.\r\n\r\nINTEGRATE WITH FITNESS AND HEALTH TRACKERS\r\nSync with popular fitness trackers and apps to further customize your goal based on your activity level. Whether you run, bike, swim, lift, do yoga, workout, or simply walk your activity level affects how much water you need to drink.\r\n\r\nNEVER LOSE YOUR BOTTLE\r\nLosing your water bottle sucks, that’s why we made it really hard for this to happen. When location services are turned on the app will know the last place it was paired with your smart water bottle and show you on a map, so you can go back and get it.\r\n\r\nKEEP AN EYE ON YOUR FRIENDS\r\nKeep an eye on your friends progress to make sure they are staying hydrated. Start some friendly competition to see who can get the best streak by meeting their goal the most days in a row.\r\n\r\nFUN NOTIFICATIONS\r\nThe app will also send helpful reminders and notifications when you begin to fall off track and need to drink more water. The bottle will also light up and glow as a fun way to remind you to stay hydrated. Can your friends’ water bottle do that?\r\n\r\n*Drinking water is essential to your bodies health and well being.

I have to turn Bluetooth off and back on for it to ever connect!! There has to be s better way..",
            "Over all its working. Has several bugs to work out. Background sync doesn't work at all. Had better luck turning it off and making sure to force close the app to get it to connect and sync regularly when you do open the app. Also, the amount of water you need to drink may suddenly sky rocket. I was at a goal of 53 oz until mid day. Then suddenly it decided I should drink 77 oz for the day. I didn't manage to get that done so late in the day.",

The first two times after contacting them the bottle worked well for a short period of time. This last time nothing worked. I highly disappointed.",

I'm using you'd because it will remind me to refill my water bottle in which I have two 50 oz bottles I have to refill but I refill them both just once everyday. Please fix this problem and respond to this message on your app review please 🙏!",
            "Exactly what I'm looking for, I've looked through over 20 water reminder apps and this one was the best one for me! It allows me to set my own reminders, edit the amount I want to drink daily, and edit the drink container sizes! I also like that I can change the background 😊 The only even sort of complaint that I have is that I wish the icon for it was different, like a water drop or something.",
            "Nice design and easy to use. Has some customisable options, including a dark mode. An extra reminder option, 'No reminder when you're ahead' would be good. So that when we're on track and ahead of the water intake the reminders don't keep showing up. Edit: App quickly incorporated this feature! Thanks Oleg."

            "Excellent app that works as advertised. Note that you can't track your history in it but I didn't really need that. A suggestion to developer: to allow reminders to be set to trigger every 3h in the given interval. If possible it would be nice if they could be set every 2.5h too.",
            "Lightweight, unobtrusive, handy. If you want an easy way to have regular reminders to drink water and a way to log your daily intake- here it is. The app doesn't have some of the more complex features of others e.g no weekly graph. Whilst the addition of plotting water intake over time would be excellent, I don't expect perfection from a free and non-monetized app. The dev has done a great job in making something light that does the job just fine.",
            "This app is simple, easy to use and understand. All I was looking for was a way to keep track of my daily intake of water as i never get thirsty and forget to drink. love that it allows you to add in different volumes as sometimes you can be drinking from a glass or bottle that is not a standard size. am loving this app and will continue to use it.",
            "I went through about 4 other apps before deciding on this one. I like the simplicity of it and the ability to change the amount you drink per entry. I don't always drink water from a water bottle so thats nice. I do however wish the was a history so that i could see my previous days intake and to also be able to amend a previous day if you forgot to add your last bottle or glass.",
            "I love how simple this is. I DEFINITELY appreciate that the whole version of this is ad-free. It's effortless and intuitive to use... The fact that it syncs with Google Fit is just icing on the cake. I wish the reminder notification sound was customizable instead of my standard device notification, but it's really not that big of a deal compared to issues I've had with other water tracking apps."

            "Great for keeping track of your water intake. No faff, easy to use. One thing; I wish the cup size was more customisable (I drink from a 400ml cup) and the interval could be set to more than an hour. But, all in all, it's a great app to track your drinking progress. Five stars! :)",
            "I actually rather liked it initially, the reminders & visual aid are quite nice, but now everytime I log my water a loud obnoxious ad starts to play. For the first week I used it the only ads were in a banner at the bottom on the log screen which was fine, but now a full screen ad pops up. It's annoying and I don't think the app is worth keeping with the addition of this nuisance - my option is to delete the app or keep my phones media volume on silent all day. 😑",
            "Breastfeeding friendly/compatible!!!!!!! :) Downloaded like 6 water reminder apps (not to track intake, but to calculate and remind) & This app is the only one that even mentioned let alone had breastfeeding as a special option!! And is now the only water reminder app left installed on my phone! Plus I am making more milk from being properly hydrated! Momma approved for sure ♡♡♡♡♡ 5 stars",

            "Very happy with the app. It's a simple way to keep track of one's water intake. As this is something that is often overlooked due to my work and personal circumstances. I believe this should work for me for a long time. So far, no issues. :)"

Sucks since my friend suggested the app and it works for her.",

            "My boyfriend recommended this app as he has the pro version for only $2.99 one off payment on his iPhone. I have an android which means I would have to pay a monthly subscription in order to get the same benefits. Absolute rip off. Why do IOS users get to pay for the pro version once and reap all the benefits while Android users have to fork out money every month for a stupid reminder app. Ill just use the free alarms on my phone.",
            "Better than all the other drink water apps because I can choose the size of the cup/bottle and just indicate the water reduction in the bottle. BUT I've noticed that if I go a day without using the app it'll stop sending me reminders which is weird. Having to manually go into the app to get it to start sending notifications every morning is annoying because I wont notice until it's like 2pm and I realize I went the whole day without drinking water.",
            "One Major Flaw! The creators of this app apparently are unaware that a large portion of the world's working population keep irregular hours such as \"night shift\" at hospitals and have made it impossible for those individuals to use the notification portion of the app and have done so in a way that makes it seem like your an idiot who can not possible tell time.",

Love, love, love the bar-code scanning feature. I think some sort of organizational options for MY FOODS would also be helpful (folders? groups? sorting?) Scrolling through an unordered list of many items is pretty laborious. Overall, it's a very valuable tool to me.",
            "I started using this app on mid March and by mid October, I had lost a total of 13 pounds. It calculates the amount of calories you should consume based on your weight and height. It has a catalogue of foods and exercises with their calories, and it also allows you to add your own. You add the food you've eaten during the day and the exercise done. Certainly, it has been a useful tool during my weight loss efforts.",
            "Love this app! Tracks food, water intake, fitness and so much more. But my favorite feature is that you can scan most products and it will input for you. You can adjust amounts, if necessary. It has a community and other nice features. I am now asking myself why was I paying for a program (starts with a \"n\"). A youtuber (Kimberly Hooks) recommended it to me so now I am recommending it as well.",

            "Very useful app with a lot of good features, however it should adjust the reminder times as well as the water intake amounts. E.g. when you drink water at 11.55 the amount you are still required to drink is reduced, but the scheduled reminder at 12.00 is not changed. It would just be awesome if the reminder times would automatically be re-calculated each time you record water intake. Still the best app I have tested.",
            "Great app for water intake. I like the adjustability of the volumes of water and the reminders. Great tool for keeping track of the water I need to drink.",
            "I paid for the app with the assumption that I would not have any more ads. I'm still seeing ads. Not happy.",

The appeal of the Water Diet is that dieters can purportedly eat what they want--and still lose weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n* How the Diet Works\r\n\r\nOn the Water Diet, the dieter drinks 64 oz. of cool or cold water in eight 8-oz. servings over the course of the day, with or without meals, in addition to the dieter's normal fluid intake.

It logged down 3 steps just starting it and for every 1 step I did, it showed at least 5. I downloaded the basic version to see if preminum would be worth it. The two main things I wanted in an app are two that are inaccurate or unavailable.",
            "I intent of this app is just want I needed. Unfortunately for me, the execution just didn't live up to expectations. For example, I have a watch to track my steps & the app doesn't allow you to enter them, only miles. The vital section does not contain BP. It is located in another section. The BMI calculator is not accurate, imo. There are additional issues that I have w/ the app but I believe it's due to personal preferences & needs. Overall, it's a decent app just not for me.",
            "I hate that you have to slide to get the numbers instead of just typing it in. Also it will not allow me to enter my food intake for this date. It automatically started at January 1st and when I changed it, it still entered to Jan 1st. Even though the date on the calender was correct.",
            "I do like the app, but it doesn't have a feature to switch to feet/inches of to fl. ounces. I also wish it could connect to google fit, fitbit, and other fitness trackers. If this is fixed then I could in good continuous give this app five stars.",
            "Very systematically efficient app. Algorithms properly arranged. Quality Control at its peak. No chance for complain. Has used different variety of colours in an unique way. Very light-weighted app. Can be easily downloaded with low data speed. Works as an accountant of our body. Gives us the invoice of our body's physical ability. No need to buy expensive smart watches. Just download this app and enjoy!"

They only added ads..which previously was an ad free app. Now there are ads everywhere including pop-up ads! Definitely no choice for me but to uninstall it. [1st Review] Good that this app is ad free but unfortunately it's a useless app because it doesn't save your progress at all. Once you exit the app all data is lost.. your progress is set back to zero. Very bad.. please fix it.",

            "This app put a spotlight on my low energy problem, highlighting how low my daily fat and omega 3 intake was. Really surprised me, but it was spot on. I feel incredible now, workouts feel better, can challenge myself now in a really good way. The app has a lot of intuitive features that keep pushing me (almost unconsciously) to good, nutrient dense foods to meet those targets. Love it.",
            "This is such a cool app for tracking nutrition intake! I was surprised to learn my calcium and magnesium intakes were consistently low. Made it easy to correct a deficit I would never have dreamed I had. Reports are easily customized. U-tube how-to's & free webinars make it easy to learn. Gold membership is a great value.",
            "Easy fix and it's be 5! It took me 3 tried to find out why it said \"invalid data\" when I wanted to create a meal. Turns out your app doesn't allow the emoticons. I was trying to use the turkey. I like colors and images so something like that is more pleasing for me. Makes keeping track \"fun\". My planner has different colors and stickers just for support. I look at a crazy week and can smile. I'm weird. Love your app tho!!",
            "I'm finding this app so useful for tracking nutrition. I have had to go on a low carbohydrate diet and I can see at a glance the net carbs and proportions of other macros to make sure I'm on track. I also love that I can check all the vitamins and minerals as well as the foods that will supply them if any are low. Excellent 🙂",
            "Counts calories and shows key nutrients! I love how you can add your own foods and there are many preavailable to save you time. And being able to see your key nutrient daily values met is wonderful. Only thing to tweak is being able to see all your minerals you've gotten from what you ate. You can only see all the mineral percentages % from individual foods eaten. But wonderful to track calories and nutrients overall!"

            "I was asked to keep a track of my intake of liquids and record when I go to the toilet by a health professional to see what is causing me issues. This app allows you to record when and what you drink and also if you leak and how urgent it is to need to go to the toilet. This app will be good to maintain and monitor that going forward.",
            "This app was able to help me see the potential health problems I was haven that went unnoticed before! After about 2 months of recording, I was able to visit my doctor with documentation when trying to explain my symptoms. Along with a food/exercise tracking app installed around the same time along with good record keeping, my doctor was able to pinpoint my exact cause of symptoms and was able to point me in the right direction for overall better personal health care!!!",
            "Exactly what I needed. Extremely simple. No ridiculous bells and whistles that only a physician would need. My only request would be an easier way to get back from the diary to an entry and reverse. A little old school to have to back out of one to get to the other. Great job. Please keep it simple guys ...too many over complicated over thought apps out there.",
            "Easy to record urine flow and liquid intake. Just enter the volume and your observations. Time of the activity is automatically recorded. Keeps a time wise diary which can be exported by pdf to a mail ID. It will help you and your doctor to monitor any issues. Very easy to use.",
            "Very effective and easy to use. I am not sure I would say I love using it to track all bladder movements, but if you need to do this, this is definitely the no-nonsense, easy-to-use tool to do it. Data export is easy and effective, allowing you the opportunity to throw real data back at your urologist. Oz to ml conversions on the fly, drink size presets, and ability to note characteristics for each entry are features I use. This app owns."

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

            "Brilliant for tracking alcohol consumption. Really useful graph shows how pissed you are now, and information reminds you how useless you may be at your current level. Looking at that has stopped me having one (or more) last drinks when I see the estimated time to sober. The graphic is so striking it even works when you're not sober! I think I'm talking myself into contributing for the pro version! The history graphs and stats are brilliant. Only prob is no export to CSV",
            "Can't recommend this app enough. Interface is a bit complex at first but after a small amount of time it's easy to navigate, this really helps me manage and time my drinks throughout the week, helps me see how much I'm drinking and to be consistent with measurements instead of free pouring. I'd recommend fully! I also love the live time input you can put in to really spread your drink out.",
            "On the whole, I like this app despite its dated UI. What I find really annoying however is the graph showing weekly consumption. I have four 'dry' days a week and my weekend consumption varies between 14 and 21 units. Last Friday, I consumed just 1.42 units but the graph shows 8 or thereabouts. On Saturday, 5.84 units but the graph for that day shows about 42. On Sunday, 11.4 and the graph is off the scale (over 75). Whatever logic is being applied is not user friendly.",
            "Really great app for making it easy to see how much you're drinking and sticking to a limit. My only complaint if you can call it that is I wish it had a cumulative weekly figure rather than an estimate based on previous consumption.",
            "I have used for many years and find it vey useful. Some have complained of inaccurate BAC but if I correctly set up with weight and absorbtion rate it compares very closely to two different breathalysers that I own. To start your week on a Monday, simply enter one dummy drink on a sunday. It will then start new from the next day. Only issue is that if you put a weekly limit in of 14 units and drink 4 units in one day, it shows 200% of target, however weekly & monthly figures correct over time."

            "Do not download this app. Ever since I downloaded it, the app disappeared from my phone and then I started getting random video ads on stuff like Chrome and Facebook. It's my theory that this app is giving me those ads. The app is using the fact that it looks like it's gone or been deleted to it's advantage. After a while, you'll forget you downloaded it and the app will get to advertise stuff 24/7, and you'll be none the wiser as to why you're getting the ads. Don't download it. It's a scam.",
            "You show what times you normally get up in the AM and go to bed at night, and how much water you want to drink during the day. You get periodic reminders to drink your water. Thats it! It helps me remember so I dont have to drink a ton at night.",
            "Thank you for a creating a fantastic user friendly App!! This App has been a great help for my mother (& the rest of the family), in keeping her up with hydrating.

            "I like the fact that the app is really easy to operate and its really simple by amazing in its own way. I think it would be perfect if it improves the reminder part of this because the main goal is to remind people that they are supposed drink something called water to keep their body healthy",
            "It has helped me increase my water intake, which has been very helpful for my pregnancy. I would suggest to make it more easy to turn on sound for notifications. Sometimes, I see the notification but it may have appeared long time ago, and I didnt hear the sound."

I haven't seen a lot of ads. If you don't want ads, change your settings or permissions.There is no prob with password reset. If you do have a prob with it, log in via the app first. If you're using the website, log in there with same password. Then sync if you'd like: option is in both the app & the website. It all works fine.",
            "I love how many options they have on this app! I've been using this for years on and off and it never disappoints. From, logging calories, to exercising, to interacting to the users, it's great. My only issue is the amount of advertisements on the app it can be veri inconvenient...",
            "Ads are pretty pervasive. There is usually an ad after every action. If I enter breakfast with 3 items, my action is delayed after each item. I would go to the premium but the option to purchase once yearly is not offered and must be debited monthly. (Not something I can do.) Thank you. I will try that. I did as suggested but the app will not let me enter foods, etc. It will not accept my goals entry. For two days I've gotten a msg asking me to connect. However, my phone is connected to the net",
            "Extremely inaccurate info, nothing I've scanned has had the correct information when compared to the labels. I don't have time to search through the hundreds of incorrect entries from members to find the one that's accurate. You also can't do anything on the app without being forced to watch ads. I won't be continuing with this app.",

An option to back up directly to Dropbox or somewhere would be nice, but simply not losing the data is very welcome. Other than those previous update problems, D-Track is a very good and useful app. I appreciate the developer's attention to dealing with this major issue.",
            "This app is a great concept, but some critical blind spots had me uninstall it and delete it from my app library. I don't have space for a full review, but I'll make a couple of recommendations. 1) Separate the treatment timer from the entering of weight and BP values. There are significant time lapses between taking pre-weight and inserting needles, and also from the end of treatment to taking the post-weight. This is unavoidable. 2) Add fields for blood pump speed, litres processed, Kt/V etc",
            "I've just had this app for an hour and I really like it. It has all the items that I need to fill out each day. Options for: cycler and twin bag exchanges; standing and sitting bp; drop down menu for solution strength for each of the bags; weight; temperature. The only reason I haven't given it a 5* is I've only just got the app. Nov. 7, 2019 The new update erased previous information. I had clicked to reload previously saved amd nothing happened.",
            "Excellent app for track commonly used data during dialysis. I think it would be a bonus if this app had a notes section to jot down key info.",
            "Was able to open after installing the update. Looks good. But needs additions like UF Setting, UF Rate, Blood Flow, etc. Weight should be before and after treatment."

            "This app ticks all the boxes for me for a weight tracking app (I've tried many). It has a decent barcode scanner and a reasonably well curated database, option to save meals and recipes, and a breakdown of macronutrients you consumed in the free subscription. It doesn't try to solve all the world's problems and do it poorly. That's impressively hard to find! I also like the UI, it's pretty, intuitive and uncluttered.",
            "Really love this app. I have used it for a month with no problems, but today I can't go to my goals without the app shutting down. Please fix this! Until today I would have given 5 stars. I've reported problem but haven't heard a response yet.",
            "Bugs fixed. I'd like to add that the year subscription is totally worth it. When paired with GoogleFit I have lost 25 lbs in three months. App holds you 100% accountable when no one else can, if you cheat you cheat yourself out of weight loss. Follow your plan , exceed your goals and the weight will fall off. By the time you realize it it is already a habit and you are accounting for everything u consume. The app will inform u of the areas that need improvement.",
            "Most nutritional information in this app is incorrect. For example, items like calories, carbohydrates and proteins are not always correct and in fact very can be far off. Where my actual carbohydrates are 180g, this app will tell me they are only 130g. This may have something to do with the fact that anyone can go in and adjust nutritional information. The app would be great otherwise but I cannot continue to use it or refer my clients because of the abundant false nutritional information.",
            "Two updates now and calories still do not change when weight changes. I have emailed support, but I guess the engineers just don't care that their app does not work properly. Not sure what their focus is within the app, but they sure are not good a fixing things they screw up thats for sure. I given up on emailing. Seems to be a huge waste of time."

            "I am using the paid version and I love it! I love the reminders and the lessons. I especially love the recipes and the fact that you have a TON of vegetarian options. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is that recipes get removed! I plan my meals a week in advance and I went today to prepare one and the 3 of the recipes are gone! There also isn't an option to download a .pdf to save for later. Please fix this and i will rate 5 stars!",
            "Great app. I've experimented with IF in the past, with great success. However, with COVID and working from home, it's a lot easier to slip up and eat whenever you want to. This app pops up periodically reminding me that I need to drink water. It's nice to have a reminder, which should prevent me from mindlessly eating when I'm not scheduled to. My first foray into IF was about 2 years ago, and I lost 85lbs in total. I'm not quite where I was before, but I'm still dealing with about 50 extra lbs. This app is highly recommended, as long as you use it as intended.",
            "Great app, takes a little learning. I was initially confused by the words encouraging me to 'End Fasting' when I was only hours into current fast. This resulted in a few badly timed fast records, but the ability to edit fasting start and end times saved me. I often forget to record my water intake, despite the much appreciated reminders from the app. The retroactive edit ability for water intake does not allow me to click on a day and edit. No response when I try to select a day's water record.",
            "Easy and Convenient app. I love that I can see my progress so easily!! I wish I could connect to my community though. It disappeared as quickly as it appeared???? I also wish I could communicate with my fasting buddies, at minimum send them an emoji or something. I use the paid version so I'm not sure what I'm getting that's any different than the free version... I don't use the recipes or the tools, I just use the trackers. All in all I'm happy I have the app though to stay on track.",
            "Love this app. I'm using the free version. There are enough features to get you started on IF. You enter basic info about yourself & they suggest a plan. You can modify the IF hours. Cool feature shows start/stop times. During fast you can see at a glance how long you've fasted/and time left. Reminders to drink water w/place to log amount. Didn't rate 5 stars because I wear an off brand fitness tracker (not listed on app) so steps are not recorded & no way to manually enter steps taken."

Also, entering numbers with scroll selectors is like threading a needle every time. WW has a option to tap on the number and type the data. If you could add this I'd be so appreciative! It would also be nice to be able to 'like' replies in Community and to reply to people by name.",

I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

When creating an app, you should follow the rule of three - a customer should be able to get to any screen within three clicks. Additionally, when you arrive at a screen, you should be able to back out and initialize previous screen. This doesn't happen with a few screens. Add to Order is one example. When you back up, it takes you to the home screen, not view scheduled order.",

You can't pay your bill, add extra deliveries, or even see any account info other than your delivery address. You can edit your recurring order & that's about it. I'm a longtime customer and I'm happy the company is developing an app, but right now it definitely needs work."

I'm also loving every other category that you can track, like energy level, medication, environment, and mood. This is going to be so helpful with managing my chronic illness! Thank you to the developer! If I continue to use it I am for sure buying premium!",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",

            "I didnt know why i couldnt gain weight since i am currently 20lbs under a healthy bmi. I started using this calculator, it help me realize what i was eating was low in calories and how to do it healthily. My fiance now uses it too to pay more attention to his sugar intake. But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",
            "I have never left a review on an app before, but this one has improved my life so much I just had to :D It's the most user friendly calorie counter I've found, and I've stuck with it for the past three months. It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",
            "This app is easy to use and very accurate. But please make a weight GAIN version. People these days who need to lose weight already have plenty of ways to do it and plenty of people to go to. But gaining weight is not only harder than losing it, it's also WAY harder to find help with it.",
            "I've only started using this app but so far I'm impressed. Eating healthy and losing weight is difficult for me but this app is a great guide to track progress.",
            "So far its very easy to follow, free and provides good advice. I think if you upgrade they provide more advice."

You have the option to watch a video or start from scratch. No matter which button I chose, it starts from scratch. I have a busy life so the reminders help me grab a drink, but i don't get to tell the app I've had a drink until nighttime. Possibly because the app takes just time to load to bother me from opening it through the day. I'd love to see the app updated. :)",

And i swear, every time I log in I either get a message that my plant has died and I have to watch a video to resurrect it, or if I record more than 2 cups at a time (like, say, at lunch during work) a bee comes and tells me to not drink so much. Not a fan. Not cute enough to be worth it.",

With the right knowledge and safety guidelines, you can lose weight with a water diet, shed those pounds and have a healthier lifestyle.\r\n\r\nBenefits of a Water Diet Plan for Weight Loss:\r\n+  Flushes out toxins and excess sodium in the body\r\n+  A healthy and natural way to lose weight and belly fat\r\n+  Aims to cleanse and detoxify your body naturally\r\n+  Debloats the body (belly fat and waist fat)\r\n+  Sheds away excess fat and helps lose weight\r\n\r\nWhat is the smart and best water diet plan?\r\nA water diet is when a person does not eat and drinks nothing other than water for a short period of time, anywhere from 24 hours to 3 days as the maximum time to go without food. Water fasting may be undertaken for a number for different reasons, including spiritual, diet, or medical reasons.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, a pure water fast is among the most trying type of fast or cleansing diet. A water fast costs nothing to do, and may be used to lose some weight, and possibly help your body flush out toxins for a healthier system.\r\n\r\nJust like many other diet apps for women and men like the Super Military Diet and Keto Diet Plan, water fast diet plan is a simple weight loss plan set in a way that helps users shed those pounds by making changes to their daily diet that in time flushes out toxins, slowly allowing the body to get the best of the nutrients afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Water Diet Plan for Weight Loss is sometimes known as the cold water diet and is among one of the latest fads that appeal to dieters who want to melt away their fat. Compared to fasting \"cleanse\" diets and those that restrict caloric intake, such as the Rice Diet, the Water Diet doesn't limit food consumption, nor does it require exercise. The appeal of the Water Diet is that dieters can purportedly eat what they want--and still lose weight.\r\n\r\nAs a water diet plan that aims to lose weight and for weight loss, it is strongly recommends us to drink plenty of water. So, one can reduce the consumption of foods that contain lots of sugar. With this new habit you will reduce the calories in your body. In addition, by consuming fruit and green vegetables on your daily meals with drinking plenty of water helps to balance out your body metabolism and cleanse your body from toxins. \r\n\r\nWe hope our best Water Diet Plan for Weight Loss has helped you lose weight with water and made you feel better about yourself, mentally and physically.

            "I had purchased the pro version of this app - which for some reason is now discontinued. I am now being asked to pay a onetime amount for a repeated pro subscription by the developers. Have reached out to them multiple times over email and have received only one automated response in return. Taking money for the pro version then pulling the application out -- that's a proper scam. There is no guarantee that, if one pays for the pro subscription now, these developers won't ring in the same scam again. Uninstall. Move on.",
            "I have purchased the pro version which I prefer over the free one. This isn't a bad app at all but there is certainly loads of room for improvement. Some suggestions: Add a barcode scanner, healthy alternative options, recipes, grocery lists, conversions and being able to connect to different exercise devices or: Fitbit, Garmin, Google fit etc. My rating will definitely change to 5 star with some or all of these options included.",
            "I've used this app before, paid for the basics. Now that is gone, when I look for foods most are gone now. It's like you deleted your food library. Uninstalling it and looking for a new app. No longer works for me.",
            "Had this app numerous times, and every time ive tried a new one always came back to this one. Super easy and simple as well as personally effective to see what helps me to track what i eat. For someone like me who has ibs it is great to log what u have eaten that day and symptoms as well as weight loss planning :)",
            "I had the Pro version of this a while ago, and it worked wonderfully. Now, I didn't mind needing to pay for Pro again with the new app, but I'm pretty upset that I can't even access the features I paid for... I still get ads, can't access my weight chart. What's the point of having spent the money at all?"

            "Works great! App is extremely user friendly & you don't have to set up log in/ password if you don't want to. Food are easy to find. It gives you the option to choose between different WW programs, so you get to choose which one you would like to use. Free, unless you prefer pro option (which allows for extra micronutrient tracking, and pairing with Fitbit or other device) Wonderful app!",
            "This app is better than any I've ever used,including WW and my fitness pal. Having the macros is very informative,and it connects with my Fitbit! The recipes are regular food,not a bunch of weird stuff. So easy to use. All this for only 19.99$ a year! WW cost that much for one month and they don't have your macronutrients. Try it,I promise you'll love it. Tracking on MyDiet Daily can and will help you lose weight the healthy way.",
            "This is a good app. However, it isn't always consistent. When you log your food, if you change the serving size, it will sometimes zero out the points. There are still some glitches in the programming that need to be worked out. Overall, a good app. Update: I paid for the extra features, however, it wasn't really worth the cost. I thought it would give me more access to restaurants, however, restaurant selections are EXTREMELY scarce. This is an area that can definitely use LOTS of improvement.",
            "Loving this app I struggle with eating healthy and have yo yo dieted for years. I have tried different food trackers but they didn't seem to fit right. Once I found this app and seen it correctly counted points and was easy to navigate I have stuck with tracking everything and within a few weeks started to see weightloss and feel better :)",
            "This app is AMAZING. I recently lost 12lbs on weight watchers and decided I didn't want to pay $26 a month every month just to get better health so I looked for an alternative. This is almost the same as weight watchers just takes a tiny bit more work to be sure the points are correct, which you can do with a quick google search. Don't hesitate! It's so affordable and a great deal for something that will help me regain my health again. I've already recommended this app to several other people!!"

I've owned multiple canteens/thermoses/bottles in the past, this is hands down the highest quality bottle I've owned. The companion app however feels more like my first React Native project. That isn't to say its horrible, but it's definitely lacking polish and features that could easily be added by anyone who's touched React Native before. App is a mediocre 2 or 3, the bottle's a 5. Get the bottle, ditch the app.",
            "I do not like the fact that you can not change the oz. I put in a oz I wanted and it goes right back to 7oz and I always drink 8oz at a time and putting in your weight you need to figure out you kg weight first because you can not change the formula till after you customize and you still have to start out with kg weight and after you change your formula it will change it for you.",

Sufficient daily water consumption helps to remove toxins, whereas dehydration may result in kidney malfunction. Using our hydration tracker, you’ll calculate the amount of water needed and won’t forget about a glass of water before breakfast or after work out. <br>Water intake tracker enables to set necessary goals and monitor the volume of water you drink every day. You will get statistics of the amount of H2O consumed and daily customizable reminders.  <br>Our water diet app is based on person’s individual characteristics and features water amount calculation in the day of hangover, which lowers the risk of intoxication and general malaise the day after a party. <br>Water is vital for health, and our practical app will help you to live a better life.",

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

Although it says it installed, it's not listed in my apps - BUT, I can open it from the Google Play screen. (??) When I try to sign in, it doesn't like my login/password. Getting a 401 error. So far only desktop version works. I've tried reinstalling, no luck. Any tips?",

Now I wish it could tell us where the leak was located each time that would be even more \"Awesome\" ! Thank you",

It still lacks some useful features like that. The UI is clutter free and nice. Half-satisfied, will try BiglyBT and LibreTorrent next.",
            "lots of bugs and glitches. Very slow moving files to completed directory, this is not indicated in status (only displays in notification). And if you start a forcecheck right after a torrent completes (while it is taking its time moving), then you'l have a big mess between the two directories. UPDATE: App now fails to download/upload. moved torrents to another app and they work fine. App continues odd things like restarting itself aftering being shut down. Is this app a virus?",
            "Flud is the best torrent client in the Google Play Store. It has all the features and settings that you'll ever need, the ads are not obtrusive, the app performs well without slowing down your device and it's free. My only complaint is that the app takes too long or freezes when I want to change the torrents content storage folder, even with files of just a few MB. Kudos to the dev and thanks for such a great app.",
            "When the movie is downloaded the movie didnt work because of the problem that it say \"you dont have app to open this file\" and I tried to find the app and installed it but still didnt work and I dont know why,I literally did it properly before compared now because when I delete it and it became difficulty and I dont know what happened maybe because my storage is not enough for the movie but I fix it and still nothing happen.",
            "This is the 4th time I've had to order replacement sd cards for my phone! I don't know why it keeps happening after leaving this on overnight as I continue to download I wake up to \"no SD card inserted\" when I view my data left in my files The app has corrupted my SD card.. I've been messaging the devs and I have been trying to get in touch with them but they aren't interested."
