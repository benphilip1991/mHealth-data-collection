        "description": "Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms — such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They're normally harmless or even helpful. But under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease.\r\n\r\nSome infectious diseases can be passed from person to person.

            "I Like the game Mechanics But theres a bit Of Problem In Being a disease and Killing Humanity. First being a Virus Or disease Is Hard on this game Plus The Simulation is Not really accurate Because the disease seems to be only Infecting Multiple times But the same deaths and Infection per day It seems tottaly Innefective. However I do like The realistic Idea of Having natural disasters and Being on Humanity's Side Because plaque Inc Has Nothing in those. the only problem is the accuracy Of It.",
            "Currently the game is bugged out or something i downloaded this once before but it appears to still have the same problem at least it doesn't crash anymore but whenever it shows something it keeps jumping back and forth to what should be the gameplay and the menus it is even slow when doing so takes around 5min to get to the pathogens and starting it up i wont uninstall but i do hope a fix come around for this predicament",
            "This is one of the best plague simulator games i've ever seen. 5 Stars because it is best in animation and cool features. I'm waiting for the zombie pathogen!.",
            "Cool but its sometimes hard to defend but it is very very good because there are no adds in between!!!! Which is very good ,quality is as expected ,I recomend a bit to install if u are patient only then install . Keep that in mind",
            "Great game because it requires a lot of strategy (when to upgrade what), but once you have a great plan, you can win through every round very fast Edit: I would like to see improvement such as dividing the regions differently!"

        "comments": [
            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nIf you like this app, please share it with other doctors.

        "description": "Follow us on Twitter: @Drexel_IMMID, #IMMID, #MalariaInvasion\r\nVisit our website: drexel.edu/medicine/immid-cbpd\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nMalaria Invasion is the second in a series of educational mobile games developed by the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease at Drexel University College of Medicine, to introduce players to the dynamic world of infectious disease. The first mobile game was CD4 Hunter™. These games are primarily intended for use as a learning tool to supplement biomedical science curriculum in higher education, by intersecting science with engaging game mechanics.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\nMalaria Invasion is a 3-level game in which players take the role of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium in the blood-stage of infection. Specifically, players play as a Plasmodium merozoite that arose in the bloodstream of an individual that had been bitten by an infected mosquito. \r\n\r\nBy intersecting real science, with attractive visuals and animations, and simple gameplay, each game level teaches players about essential aspects of the complex mechanism by which merozoites invade RBCs while evading the immune system:\r\n•\tLevel 1, Circulation: The goal is to identify and infect as many RBCs as possible and not be detected by the immune system.\r\n•\tLevel 2, Attachment: The goal is to attach specific proteins produced by the merozoite to their specific receptors on the RBC.  The successful protein-receptor binding will increase the intracellular calcium needed to proceed with the invasion process.\r\n•\tLevel 3, Invasion: The goal is to develop the tight junctions necessary to engage the actin-myosin motor and drive the merozoite into the RBC.\r\n\r\nLearning Goals:\r\n1.\tExplain the role of the Plasmodium merozoite in the progression of the blood-stage malaria infection.\r\n2.\tIdentify RBCs and their specific cell-surface receptors as the merozoite targets in the post-hepatic stage of the Plasmodium replication cycle.\r\n3.\tIdentify the key Plasmodium organelles involved in RBC invasion and define the function of essential protein ligands they secrete to facilitate invasion.\r\n4.\tExplain the role of the essential ligand-receptor pairs in the process of RBC invasion by the Plasmodium \r\n5.\tCorrelate the evasion of the immune system with the progression of the malaria infection during the blood stage of the Plasmodium replication cycle.\r\n6.\tIdentify important metabolic and structural changes involved in the process of Plasmodium merozoite invasion of RBCs.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nMalaria Invasion was designed and developed by faculty of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology (Mary Ann Comunale, EdD, MS and Sandra Urdaneta-Hartmann, MD, Ph.D., MBA) at Drexel University College of Medicine, and an undergraduate student from Drexel University’s Game Design Program (John Harvey). \r\n\r\nLawrence Bergman, Ph.D., James Burns, Ph.D., and Akhil Vaidya, Ph.D., also faculty in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, contributed their expertise on malaria. \r\n\r\nBrian Wigdahl, Ph.D., Chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Executive Director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease is the Executive Producer of Malaria Invasion.\r\n\r\nFunding for this project was provided by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease.

        "description": "Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.\r\nThe virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The hepatitis B viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five main hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis B Guide, Hepatitis B Disease Management & Hepatitis B Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis B Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

It is one of five main hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. <br>==========================<br>APP FEATURES<br>==========================<br>This exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis B Guide, Hepatitis B Disease Management &amp; Hepatitis B Disease causes.<br>Here are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis B Disease apps - <br>-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. <br>-\tEasily Change the page.<br>-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.<br>-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.<br>-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.<br><br>All these features are available for free. <br><br>==========================<br>SAY HELLO<br>==========================<br>Any medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Influenza, commonly known as \"the flu\", is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus. Symptoms can be mild to severe. The most common symptoms include: a high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks. In children, there may be nausea and vomiting, but these are not common in adults. Nausea and vomiting occur more commonly in the unrelated infection gastroenteritis, which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as \"stomach flu\" or the \"24-hour flu\". Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure. \r\nThree types of influenza viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, the virus is spread through the airfrom coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Influenza symptoms, Influenza Management, Influenza causes, Influenza diagnosis, Influenza Prognosis, Influenza Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Influenza Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "The aim of this app is to help the reader appreciate the relevance of virology in the modern world, including the fields of vaccines, anti-viral drugs and cancer. There is also a chapter on prions.\r\n\r\nThis remains an excellent app for any student studying virology as part of their degree. The early chapters provide a thorough and clearly written background to the necessary molecular biology, and are suitable both for the beginner but also as a short refresher course. The app uses figures and schematics extremely well to explain a number of diverse virus replication cycles in helpful stages, building towards the bigger picture each time. Supporting chapters exploring concepts such as vaccines, therapeutics and pathology make the app a very complete yet compact review of modern virology. I highly recommend this app.\r\n\r\nVirology is a fascinating and rapidly developing subject. The introduction of new laboratory techniques and the continued application of established methods are producing a wealth of new information. Virology is a branch of science that is of immense relevance to mankind for a host of reasons, not least of which is the threat to human health caused by viruses, such as HIV, the hepatitis B virus, papillomaviruses, measles and influenza viruses, to mention just a few.\r\n\r\nThe app of Virology is an accessible introduction designed to enable students to understand the principles of virus structure, replication and genetics. The aim of this app  is to help the reader appreciate the relevance of virology in the modern world, including the fields of vaccines, anti-viral drugs and cancer. There is also a chapter on prions. The second edition has been extensively revised and updated to reflect the many developments in virology and offers deeper insights into the subject. Newly-discovered viruses are discussed and there is an additional chapter on the influenza virus.\r\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE:\r\n\r\nAn introduction to the relevance of virology to the modern world, including the latest developments in the field\r\nAn introduction to the theories behind the origins of viruses and how they are evolving, with discussion on emerging viruses\r\nAimed at undergraduate students of biology, microbiology and biomedical sciences taking courses in virology, this is also an invaluable resource for graduate students who have previously studied little or no virology and are looking for an accessible introduction to the subject.\r\n\r\nVirology: Principles and Applications is a clear and accessible introduction to this fast-moving field, providing a comprehensive resource enabling the reader to understand the key concepts surrounding this exciting subject. The reader is introduced to the principles of virus structure, replication and genetics, along with the theories behind the origins of viruses and how they are evolving. \r\n\r\n this app covers the field of virology from molecular biology to disease processes using a unique systems approach. There is a new chapter on Human Viral Disease and rapidly developing areas, such as the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, have been included.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of immunology now covers two chapters, one on innate immunity and the other on adaptive immunity, reflecting the explosion in knowledge of viral interactions with these systems. \r\n\r\nThe coverage of vaccines and antivirals has been expanded and separated into two new chapters to reflect the importance of these approaches to prevention and treatment. \r\nVirus infections in humans are considered in more detail with new chapters on viral hepatitis, influenza, vector-borne diseases, and exotic and emerging viral infections, complementing an updated chapter on HIV.  \r\n\r\nThe final section includes three new chapters on the broader aspects of the influence of viruses on our lives, focussing on the economic impact of virus infections, the ways we can use viruses in clinical and other spheres, and the impact that viruses have on the planet and almost every aspect of our lives.",

        "description": "What is a vaginal yeast infection?\r\nA vaginal yeast infection, also known as candidiasis, is a common condition. A healthy vagina contains bacteria and some yeast cells. But when the balance of bacteria and yeast changes, the yeast cells can multiply. This causes intense itching, swelling, and irritation.\r\n\r\nTreating a vaginal yeast infection can relieve symptoms within a few days. In more severe cases, it may take up to two weeks.\r\n\r\nVaginal yeast infections aren’t considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Sexual contact can spread it, but women who aren’t sexually active can also get them. Once you get a yeast infection, you’re also more likely to get another one.\r\n\r\nWhat are the symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection?\r\nVaginal yeast infections have a common set of symptoms, such as:\r\n\r\nvaginal itching\r\nswelling around the vagina\r\nburning during urination or sex\r\npain during sex\r\nsoreness\r\nredness\r\nrash\r\nWhitish-gray and clumpy vaginal discharge is another telltale symptom. Some people say this discharge looks like cottage cheese. Sometimes the discharge may also be watery.\r\n\r\nUsually the length of time your yeast infection is left untreated has a direct impact on how severe your symptoms may become.\r\n\r\nWhat causes vaginal yeast infections?\r\nThe fungus Candida is a naturally occurring microorganism in the vaginal area. Lactobacillus bacteria keeps its growth in check.\r\n\r\nBut if there’s an imbalance in your system, these bacteria won’t work effectively. This leads to an overgrowth of yeast, which causes the symptoms of vaginal yeast infections.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors can cause a yeast infection, including:\r\n\r\nantibiotics (they decrease the amount of Lactobacillus [“good bacteria”] in the vagina)\r\npregnancy\r\nuncontrolled diabetes\r\nweak immune system\r\npoor eating habits, including a lot of sugary foods\r\nhormonal imbalance near your menstrual cycle\r\nstress\r\nlack of sleep\r\nA specific kind of yeast called Candida albicans causes most yeast infections. These yeast infections are easily treatable.\r\n\r\nIf you’re having recurring yeast infections or problems getting rid of a yeast infection with conventional treatment, then a different version of Candida might be the cause. A lab test can identify what type of Candida you have.\r\n\r\nHow do you prevent vaginal yeast infections?\r\nTake up\r\neating a well-balanced diet\r\neating yogurt or taking supplements with lactobacillus\r\nwearing natural fibers such as cotton, linen, or silk\r\nwashing underwear in hot water\r\nreplacing feminine products frequently\r\nAvoid\r\nwearing tight pants, pantyhose, tights, or leggings\r\nusing feminine deodorant or scented tampons or pads\r\nsitting around in wet clothing, especially bathing suits\r\nsitting in hot tubs or taking frequent hot baths\r\ndouching\r\nOften you probably know exactly what led to your yeast infection.

        "description": "Wellcome in Apps Antibiotic Dictionary\r\n\r\nAntibiotic is an agent that weakens or destroys bacteria; antibiotics are medically used to treat various types of bacterial infections. The various types of antibiotics work either by preventing an infection from growing or by destroying an existing infection. Antibiotics are produced either from a mold or a fungus or are produced synthetically.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What are the various types of antibiotics and what do they do?\r\n\r\nCommon forms of antibiotics include aminoglycosides, macrolides, penicillins, tetracyclines, and cephalosporins.\r\n\r\nAminoglycosides work by interfering with the protein formation of bacteria. Aminoglycosides include gentamicin, amikacin, and tobramycin. Side effects can include damage to the nerves of hearing and balance, as well as kidney injury.\r\n\r\nMacrolide antibiotics interfere with the protein formation of bacteria during multiplication. Erythromycin is a macrolide. Side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort.\r\n\r\nPenicillins (discovered by Sir Alexannder Fleming in 1928) work by damaging the cell walls of the invading bacteria as the bacteria reproduce. Penicillin G and V are widely used for streptococcal and other bacterial infections. Broad-spectrum penicillins, such as ampicillin and amoxicillin, are used on a variety of infections caused by gram-negative organisms. Hypersensitivity reactions, for example, a fever or a rash, are fairly common side effects of penicillin use. Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) rarely occur, but can be life-threatening.\r\n\r\nTetracyclines, which are active against a wide range of bacteria and other organisms, are thought to prevent production of proteins in the invading bacterial cells. The tetracyclines include tetracycline and doxycycline. Side effects of therapy may include gastrointestinal irritation, sensitivity of the skin to sunlight, and liver and kidney injury. This group of drugs should not be administered during the last four to five months of pregnancy, nor should it be given to children before the age of eight years. Permanent discoloration of developing teeth may result.\r\n\r\nCephalosporins are relatively new antibiotics active against a wide range of bacteria. Like penicillins, they interfere with bacterial cell wall formation. A frequently used cephalosporin is cefaclor. Side effects include rashes and fever. Sometimes, persons allergic to penicillins will also be allergic to cephalosporins.",

        "description": "A vaginal yeast infection is an infection resulting from the overgrowth of yeast, which is a type of fungus.\r\n\r\nAlso called candida vaginitis or vulvovaginal candidiasis, yeast infections are most commonly caused by the fungus Candida albicans.\r\n\r\nThey can also be caused by other Candida species, including C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei.\r\n\r\nUp to 75% of women will get a vaginal yeast infection at least once in their lives, and 40 to 50 % of women will experience more than one infection, according to research published in The Lancet.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, 5 to 8 % of women experience recurrent or chronic yeast infections, and come down with four or more yeast infections in a single year.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, men can get yeast infections in their genitals, mouths, and other areas.\r\n\r\nWith treatment, most yeast infections take between three and seven days to clear up. If symptoms persist for more than a week, check with your doctor to rule out a more serious condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen should see a healthcare provider the first time vaginal yeast infection symptoms occur or if they are unsure as to whether they have a yeast infection. If certain, the condition can be treated with over-the-counter medications. However, if symptoms do not respond to one course of over-the-counter medications, yeast infection may not be the problem. Pregnant women or those with weakened immune systems should contact a doctor before beginning any over-the-counter self-treatment. Women who experience recurrent vaginal yeast infections, or yeast infections that do not clear up with treatment, should immediately contact a healthcare provider for professional diagnosis and management. If a woman has more than four episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in a year, she is deemed to have recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.\r\n\r\nBy Downloading and using this FREE Yeast Infection Cure App you will learn;\r\n\r\nWhat is a yeast infection?\r\nHow Do You Know If It’s a Vaginal Yeast Infection?\r\nCauses of Vaginal Yeast Infections\r\nVaginal Yeast Infection Symptoms\r\nHow to Treat Vaginal Yeast Infections\r\nHome remedies for yeast infection \r\nYeast Infection Treatment\r\n\r\nAND\r\nMuch much more..........\r\n\r\nYeast infections are caused by the proliferation of normally growing fungi which occur in small concentrations in the vagina. This overgrowth inflames the vagina and creates discharge, odor, irritation, and/or itching. Normally growing bacteria in the body typically keep yeast fungi in check. If the natural balance of microorganisms is altered, the yeast may multiply and become the dominant organism in the vagina.

If symptoms persist for more than a week, check with your doctor to rule out a more serious condition.<br><br><br>Women should see a healthcare provider the first time vaginal yeast infection symptoms occur or if they are unsure as to whether they have a yeast infection. If certain, the condition can be treated with over-the-counter medications. However, if symptoms do not respond to one course of over-the-counter medications, yeast infection may not be the problem. Pregnant women or those with weakened immune systems should contact a doctor before beginning any over-the-counter self-treatment. Women who experience recurrent vaginal yeast infections, or yeast infections that do not clear up with treatment, should immediately contact a healthcare provider for professional diagnosis and management. If a woman has more than four episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in a year, she is deemed to have recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.<br><br>By Downloading and using this FREE Yeast Infection Cure App you will learn;<br><br>What is a yeast infection?<br>How Do You Know If It’s a Vaginal Yeast Infection?<br>Causes of Vaginal Yeast Infections<br>Vaginal Yeast Infection Symptoms<br>How to Treat Vaginal Yeast Infections<br>Home remedies for yeast infection <br>Yeast Infection Treatment<br><br>AND<br>Much much more..........<br><br>Yeast infections are caused by the proliferation of normally growing fungi which occur in small concentrations in the vagina. This overgrowth inflames the vagina and creates discharge, odor, irritation, and/or itching. Normally growing bacteria in the body typically keep yeast fungi in check. If the natural balance of microorganisms is altered, the yeast may multiply and become the dominant organism in the vagina.

        "title": "Tuberculosis: Causes, Diagnosis, and Management",
        "description": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \"consumption\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. \r\nTuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze.

        "descriptionHTML": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term &quot;consumption&quot; came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. <br>Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids.

In severe cases there may be confusion. Without treatment symptoms may last weeks or months. Other people may carry the bacterium without being affected; however, they are still able to spread the disease to others. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever along with paratyphoid fever. The cause is the bacterium Salmonella typhi, also known as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, growing in the intestines and blood. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person. Risk factors include poor sanitation and poor hygiene. Those who travel to the developing world are also at risk and only humans can be infected. Diagnosis is by either culturing the bacteria or detecting the bacterium's DNA in the blood, stool, or bone marrow. Culturing the bacterium can be difficult. Bone marrow testing is the most accurate.

Myocarditis may result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may result in paralysis. Diphtheria is usually spread between people by direct contact or through the air. It may also be spread by contaminated objects. Some people carry the bacteria without having symptoms, but can still spread the disease to others. The three main types of C. diphtheriae cause different severities of disease. The symptoms are due to a toxin produced by the bacteria. Diagnosis can often be made based on the appearance of the throat with confirmation by microbiological culture. Previous infection may not prevent against future infection.",

By immersing real science within simple game play, users learn about the first step of HIV-1’s fascinating and complex replication cycle: binding and attachment. CD4 Hunter invites players to enter the bloodstream and grow their viral population by infecting specific target cells, while evading the immune system. \r\n\r\nDownload CD4 Hunter for free to: \r\n•\tLearn complex science through fast-paced and addictive game play\r\n•\tHunt for target cells in the human bloodstream\r\n•\tControl and grow your viral population\r\n•\tFace antibody attacks as the immune system fights infection\r\n\r\nLearning Goals:\r\nCD4 Hunter is the first in a series of mini-games to be developed by the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease at Drexel University College of Medicine, to introduce players to the dynamic world of infectious disease. CD4 Hunter was designed to supplement learning about the multi-stage process of the HIV-1 replication cycle, through interactive gameplay. This app is intended for use in biomedical science curriculum in higher education. Users apply knowledge about the biological processes involved during HIV-1 replication to advance in the game. CD4 Hunter focuses on meeting the following learning objectives:\r\n\r\n1.

By immersing real science within simple game play, users learn about the first step of HIV-1’s fascinating and complex replication cycle: binding and attachment. CD4 Hunter invites players to enter the bloodstream and grow their viral population by infecting specific target cells, while evading the immune system. <br><br>Download CD4 Hunter for free to: <br>•\tLearn complex science through fast-paced and addictive game play<br>•\tHunt for target cells in the human bloodstream<br>•\tControl and grow your viral population<br>•\tFace antibody attacks as the immune system fights infection<br><br>Learning Goals:<br>CD4 Hunter is the first in a series of mini-games to be developed by the Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease at Drexel University College of Medicine, to introduce players to the dynamic world of infectious disease. CD4 Hunter was designed to supplement learning about the multi-stage process of the HIV-1 replication cycle, through interactive gameplay. This app is intended for use in biomedical science curriculum in higher education. Users apply knowledge about the biological processes involved during HIV-1 replication to advance in the game. CD4 Hunter focuses on meeting the following learning objectives:<br><br>1. Identify gp120 as a basic element of HIV-1 structure and apply knowledge about its function in the process of viral binding and entry.<br><br>2. Identify CD4+ T cells as targets for HIV-1 infection in humans and apply knowledge about their role in viral pathogenesis.<br><br>3.

Half the time, the doctor skills wont work, half the time the game wont progress. And most importantly do introduce a system where we can view our own ranks. We only get to know the rank at the end of the contest. How can we opt for a particular reward then?",
            "While this game started out really good...as of the last month or so, this game has become almost usable. I will change the stars when the developers fix the bugs. *no chat, live contests haven't worked in a long while, arena keeps freezing thereby you lose the fight.",
            "I rated this game low due to the fact that all the progress I made for almost a week got completely erased off (including a purchase I made previously) due to the fact that I just decided to connect my Google account to it. For a game I truly enjoy playing, having to lose your progress is rather frustrating.",
            "A rather interesring game. Takes some patience. There's a problem in its competitive Contest mode where player scores are reset at the end of its 3-day period (1-day if Coin Contest), denying players their rewards. Hope the devs can look into this.",
            "Very fun game that I enjoy playing. Reason why I gave such a low rating is for two reasons. 1) in arena when I challenge it completely stops and all I can do is forfeit right match. 2) I can longer make purchases in game. Aside from that great game all around. Update, emailed and now even more people in arena freeze the game. I can't advance at all anymore and it's getting annoying. Please fix or I'll find another game to spend on."

        "description": "Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the measles virus. Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Initial symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C (104.0 °F), cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots known as Koplik's spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Complications occur in about 30% of cases and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia, among others. Rubella, which is sometimes called German measles, and roseola are different diseases caused by unrelated viruses. \r\nMeasles is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of infected people. It may also be spread through contact with saliva or nasal secretions. Nine out of ten people who are not immune and share living space with an infected person will catch it. People are infectious to others from four days before to four days after the start of the rash. Most people do not get the disease more than once. Testing for the measles virus in suspected cases is important for public health efforts. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Measles Guide, Measles Disease Management & Measles Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Measles Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "This app Color Atlas of Skin Diseases - Dermatology Atlas is for medical student, doctors, dermatologist, nurses and other health practitioners to understand Dermatology Atlas with Treatment. The cases contain pictures (Zoom in/Out of illustrated color images), etiology and treatment of many skin infections.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2. History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nDon't forget to share it with other doctors.",

        "description": "Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is damage to or disease affecting nerves, which may impair sensation, movement, gland or organ function, or other aspects of health, depending on the type of nerve affected. Common causes include systemic diseases (such as diabetes or leprosy), vitamin deficiency, medication (e.g., chemotherapy, or commonly prescribed antibiotics including Metronidazole and the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Levaquin, Avelox etc.), traumatic injury, including ischemia, radiation therapy, excessive alcohol consumption, immune system disease, Coeliac disease, or viral infection. It can also be genetic (present from birth) or idiopathic (no known cause). In conventional medical usage, the word neuropathy (neuro-, \"nervous system\" and -pathy, \"disease of\") without modifier usually means peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy affecting just one nerve is called \"mononeuropathy\" and neuropathy involving nerves in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body is called \"symmetrical polyneuropathy\" or simply \"polyneuropathy\". When two or more (typically just a few, but sometimes many) separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected it is called \"mononeuritis multiplex\", \"multifocal mononeuropathy\", or \"multiple mononeuropathy\", mononeuritis multiplex.",

I get a notice that i need to renew. I try to renew and it says I have a subscription. I try to restore it asks if this is the device I subscribed under. Cleared cache etc nothing works. I contacted their support was told \"Valerie\" is on vacation on 8/13/20. We in a pandemic guys come on. Who's on vacay right now?",

            "Simply junk and I feel ripped off. It worked great for one day then it stopped working. I tried uninstalling the reinstalling but that did not work either. I tried emailing the company and received an \"out of the office\" notice. Poor product, poor customer service, poor everything. Too bad it appeared that it had quick and easy as well as useable content.",
            "Once installed and i had paid for the one year subscription i found out i vould not open or navigate beyond the menu. Even downloaded a second time with same issue. we emailed customer support with no response. When I want to cancel my subscription it did not even give me the option to reimburse the $9.99 I spent even though I never got to use the app once.",

I wish I could see a list of all infections in alphabetical order like my old emra ABX app. Instead, now I have to select a system category first and then look for the infecrion I need to find.

        "description": "Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skinoccurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach. \r\nHCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis C Guide, Hepatitis C Disease Management & Hepatitis C Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis C Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Yea this app is one of the apps that steal your phone number by asking if they have permission to make and receive phone calls for you. And the second you hit accept you can't undo it even if you uninstall the app. Total scam, they make money by selling your information and the permissions you gave them to sketchy companies to scam more people.",

During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk.",

        "description": "Poliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paralysis, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over a few hours to a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection. Poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.",

It is free app. As Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected.The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. It was historically called \"consumption\" due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests and so on. \r\nYou can download more other apps from my catalogue",

Most infections do not have symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected.The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. It was historically called &quot;consumption&quot; due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.<br><br>Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests and so on. <br>You can download more other apps from my catalogue",

        "description": "Cellulitis is a bacterial infection involving the inner layers of the skin. It specifically affects the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Signs and symptoms include an area of redness which increases in size over a few days.The borders of the area of redness are generally not sharp and the skin may be swollen. While the redness often turns white when pressure is applied, this is not always the case.The area of infection is usually painful. Lymphatic vessels may occasionally be involved, and the person may have a fever and feel tired.The legs and face are the most common sites involved, though cellulitis can occur on any part of the body. The leg is typically affected following a break in the skin. Other risk factors include obesity, leg swelling, and old age. For facial infections, a break in the skin beforehand is not usually the case. The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast to cellulitis, erysipelas is a bacterial infection involving the more superficial layers of the skin, present with an area of redness with well-defined edges, and more often is associated with a fever.",

            "In my opinion, this app is not worth the money for the Pro features. Only generic and limited information that one can find for free by doing a Google search on the topics. For example, the Pro feature Meal Planner is only one day's meals, unless you agree to buy another upgrade to the meal planner that costs about three times as much as you paid to unlock the Pro features. Paid to stop ads -app does not show menu to enter code - wasted that money too. More a store front than an app.",

Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles.The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Repeated infections of the eyes that go without treatment can result in trachoma, a common cause of blindness in the developing world. Chlamydia can be spread during vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth. The eye infections may also be spread by personal contact, flies, and contaminated towels in areas with poor sanitation. Chlamydia trachomatis only occurs in humans. Diagnosis is often by screening which is recommended yearly in sexually active women under the age of twenty five, others at higher risk, and at the first prenatal visit. Testing can be done on the urine or a swab of the cervix, vagina, or urethra.  Rectal or mouth swabs are required to diagnose infections in those areas.",

Fusion of germs will allow you to increase infection rates and the level of the mutants and develop them into mean and rare disease full pandemic. The more evolved the fungus are the more destruction and disaster they will spread. \r\n\r\nBe sure to join as many viruses as possible to find new more evolved and strong germs. Use fusion to improve the level and mutate and produce the horrid result of the world pandemic. The more mutations, the stronger the plague will be and the more tiny creatures will appear. These colourful parasites of doom will develop into beasts of terror causing deadly infection and pain.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic epidemic will grow as you continue breed and discover new germs and parasites to add to the colony of horrible and nasty mutations. These creepy creatures can be developed incrementally by merging them together to create incremental mutations. Each nasty parasite discovery can be merged with any other virus of the same level to expand the small and mean colourful colony of death.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpgrades and Gift Boxes: \r\n\r\nYou will be able to upgrade and improve any of your creations by using the gift boxes that will appear randomly. These gifts of doom and death bring new bacteria that is already developed into disease full creations. Collect as many gift boxes as possible to improve your deadly epidemic faster.

            "Bad experience! The app was good at first but now it pretty much stopped being updated, for the record: as of today (13/6/2020) there are more than 18,000 cases in Israel, but the app is stuck on 17,000 still!!!! Don't download it of you wish to protect yourself somehow, because this app might even harm you due to its lack of updates since you might think that the location where you are it's safe, but in reality it might won't be becase the app didn't update to the last covid-19 number of cases",
            "It would be good if it showed everywhere in Israel where the virus exists, but it doesn't. I live near Kfar Yona where the virus was found in a student, but no dots about it. In fact, the map doesn't even show the new area of kfar yona that is already 2 or 3 years old where buildings are in isolation today. In other words, not a good app, so Lacking in correct information.",
            "Not in English, it doesn't work in England. Most probably for Israel judging by the map and possible Hebrew language?",
            "Great app given the circumstances! A few suggestions: Please create full English option as not everyone understands Hebrew well. Also, could you please include a legend; it is not clear what is difference between yellow virus and red virus. I assume blue refers to hospitals but this is also not clear. Thank you and good luck!",
            "Fantastic app. The numbers that it gives are very much updated. I downloaded my list of places and times, it is perfect: the time is given in milliseconds from 1970, the coordinates get to the exact places in Google Maps. I haven't got an alert of having been in a potentially contaminated place + time :-) ."

        "description": "Use this app to learn about the symptoms of HIV and more about the virus\r\n\r\nWhat is HIV?\r\n\r\nHIV is a virus that damages the immune system. The immune system helps the body fight off infections. Untreated HIV infects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cells. Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of infections and cancers. \r\n\r\nHIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:\r\n\r\n    blood\r\n    semen\r\n    vaginal and rectal fluids\r\n    breast milk\r\n\r\nThe virus doesn’t spread in air or water, or through casual contact.\r\n\r\nStages of HIV\r\n\r\n    stage 1: acute stage, the first few weeks after transmission\r\n    stage 2: clinical latency, or chronic stage\r\n    stage 3: AIDS\r\n\r\nHIV is a lifelong condition and currently there is no cure, although many scientists are working to find one. However, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.\r\n\r\nWithout treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called AIDS. At that point, the immune system is too weak to fight off other diseases and infections. Untreated, life expectancy with AIDS is about three years Trusted Source. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-controlled and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.\r\n\r\nIt’s estimated that 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 5 don’t know they have the virus.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top 20 countries with people living with Hiv\r\n\r\nSwaziland\r\nLesotho\r\nBotswana\r\nSouth Africa\r\nNamibia\r\nZimbabwe\r\nZambia\r\nMozambique\r\nMalawi\r\nUganda\r\nEquatorial Guinea\r\nKenya\r\nTanzania\r\nCentral African Republic\r\nCameroon\r\nGabon\r\nBahamas, \r\nThe\tCongo, \r\nRepublic of the Guinea-Bissau\r\nRwanda\r\n\r\nHIV can cause changes throughout the body. Learn about the effects of HIV on the different systems in the body.\r\n\r\n What is AIDS?\r\n\r\nAIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean they’ll develop AIDS.\r\n\r\nHIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below 200 per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.\r\n\r\nA person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an opportunistic infection or cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV. An opportunistic infection, such as pneumonia, is one that takes advantage of a unique situation, such as HIV.\r\n\r\nUntreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about three years Trusted Source. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.\r\n\r\nIf AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised. It’s weakened to the point where it can no longer fight off most diseases and infections. That makes the person vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:\r\n\r\n    pneumonia\r\n    tuberculosis\r\n    oral thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth or throat\r\n    cytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus\r\n    cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection in the brain\r\n    toxoplasmosis, a brain infection caused by a parasite\r\n    cryptosporidiosis, an infection caused by an intestinal parasite\r\n    cancer, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma\r\n\r\nThe shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself.

Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy. Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) which is most often spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also spread through genital touching. People who are infected may spread the disease even when symptoms are not present. Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in the vaginal fluid using a microscope, culturing the vagina or urine, or testing for the parasite's DNA. If present other sexually transmitted infections should be tested for.",

I have been using this app for over a year now and will go to it for almost anything from an ear ache to muscle cramps, infections, stomach aches, the flu, head colds, you name it and this book with have the natural cure for it.",
            "Careful, reviews here were bought. Check other apps of phytotherapy and you'll find the exact same words. That aside, I still don't suggest this app, nor for beginners or professionals. For beginners there're way too many technical terms just to fill in the page. For professionals we know there'rre A LOT of danger with what they're mentioning regarding the method on how to use the plant. Cut the leaf and ingest it? What part of the leaf? How many? Unless you know what you're doing, don't risk it",
            "I have had this app several months now, I check with this app whenever some new illness or health issue arises. This app should be in every phone because doctors won't tell you \" fix yourself \" , with common products found in many homes , to solve your problem . After all they are in the pill prescription business",
            "Having studied herbalism and alternative medicine for decades I expected something more from this app. The list of herbs, while lengthy, omits a number of extremely important and useful herbs while including some that I have never heard of. Some of the recommendations are more like old folk cures and again, omit proven useful herbal remedies. I would not rely on this app for anything.",
            "I gave it 5 starts because it really is a rather comprehensive beginning herbal app. If you know nothing you will come away knowing enough to get you started. It also very well organized, which definitely supports learning. If you know most of this it is a great reference for common ailments and herbs."

This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are infected. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.\r\nRubella is usually spread through the air via coughs of people who are infected. People are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash. Babies with CRS may spread the virus for more than a year. Only humans are infected. Insects do not spread the disease. Once recovered, people are immune to future infections. Testing is available that can verify immunity.

The best studied example is the association between Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer: almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by certain strains of this sexually transmitted virus. Another example is the association of infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses and liver cancer.\r\n\r\nSome subviral particles also cause disease: the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which include Kuru, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"mad cow disease\"), are caused by prions,[6] hepatitis D is due to a satellite virus.\r\n\r\nThe study of the manner in which viruses cause disease is viral pathogenesis. The degree to which a virus causes disease is its virulence.\r\n\r\nWhen the immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it may produce specific antibodies which bind to the virus and neutralize its infectivity or mark it for destruction. Antibody presence in blood serum is often used to determine whether a person has been exposed to a given virus in the past, with tests such as ELISA. Vaccinations protect against viral diseases, in part, by eliciting the production of antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, specific to the virus, are also used for detection, as in fluorescence microscopy.\r\n\r\nA second defense of vertebrates against viruses, cell-mediated immunity, involves immune cells known as T cells: the body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and if a T cell recognizes a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. This mechanism is jump-started by certain vaccinations.\r\n\r\nRNA interference, an important cellular mechanism found in plants, animals and many other eukaryotes, most likely evolved as a defense against viruses. An elaborate machinery of interacting enzymes detects double-stranded RNA molecules (which occur as part of the life cycle of many viruses) and then proceeds to destroy all single-stranded versions of those detected RNA molecules.\r\n\r\nEvery lethal viral disease presents a paradox: killing its host is obviously of no benefit to the virus, so how and why did it evolve to do so? Today it is believed that most viruses are relatively benign in their natural hosts; some viral infection might even be beneficial to the host.[7] The lethal viral diseases are believed to have resulted from an \"accidental\" jump of the virus from a species in which it is benign to a new one that is not accustomed to it (see zoonosis). For example, viruses that cause serious influenza in humans probably have pigs or birds as their natural host, and HIV is thought to derive from the benign non-human primate virus SIV.\r\n\r\nWhile it has been possible to prevent (certain) viral diseases by vaccination for a long time, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a comparatively recent development. The first such drug was interferon, a substance that is naturally produced when an infection is detected and stimulates other parts of the immune system.",

An elaborate machinery of interacting enzymes detects double-stranded RNA molecules (which occur as part of the life cycle of many viruses) and then proceeds to destroy all single-stranded versions of those detected RNA molecules.<br><br>Every lethal viral disease presents a paradox: killing its host is obviously of no benefit to the virus, so how and why did it evolve to do so? Today it is believed that most viruses are relatively benign in their natural hosts; some viral infection might even be beneficial to the host.[7] The lethal viral diseases are believed to have resulted from an &quot;accidental&quot; jump of the virus from a species in which it is benign to a new one that is not accustomed to it (see zoonosis). For example, viruses that cause serious influenza in humans probably have pigs or birds as their natural host, and HIV is thought to derive from the benign non-human primate virus SIV.<br><br>While it has been possible to prevent (certain) viral diseases by vaccination for a long time, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a comparatively recent development. The first such drug was interferon, a substance that is naturally produced when an infection is detected and stimulates other parts of the immune system.",

        "title": "Gallstone Disease: Causes, Diagnosis,and Treatment",
        "description": "A gallstone is a stone formed within the gallbladder out of bile components. The term cholelithiasis may refer to the presence of gallstones or to the diseases caused by gallstones. Most people with gallstones (about 80%) never have symptoms. When a gallstone blocks the bile duct, a crampy pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, known as biliary colic (gallbladder attack) can result. This happens in 1–4% of those with gallstones each year. Complications of gallstones may include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), jaundice, and infection of a bile duct (cholangitis). Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, dark urine, and pale stools. \r\nRisk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Gallstones formed mainly from cholesterol are termed cholesterol stones, and those mainly from bilirubin are termed pigment stones. Gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms. Diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound. Complications may be detected on blood tests. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Gallstone symptoms, Gallstone Management & Gallstone causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Gallstone Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal. \r\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite – a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures to confirm the exact cause are not required. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Diarrhea symptoms, Diarrhea Treatment, Diarrhea causes, Diarrhea diagnosis, Diarrhea Prognosis, Diarrhea Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Diarrhea Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Lifestyle-related conditions are largely preventable. This App is aimed at contributing to the reduction of Lifestyle Diseases Unequivocal evidence exists that the combination of health policy at the societal level and health education at the individual and family level related to smoking cessation, optimal nutrition, weight control and physical activity and exercise, optimal sleep, and stress management would largely prevent, manage, and some cased reverse these conditions (Dean et al., 2011).  According to  Reddy (2002), less research has been conducted on non- communicable diseases according (Mensah, 2008). However, both infectious and NCD are significant contributors to the increased morbidity and mortality of South Africans.  In 2004, more than half of all deaths in SSA were caused by infectious conditions, and one – quarter by non-communicable diseases (NCD), which by 2030 NCO will cause 46 percent (Chopra et al., 2009). Majority of these diseases are related to lifestyles (Rosendorff et al., 2007)\r\nDiabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity have become major public health problems of global significance (Tsai et al, 2004, Adibelli et al 2008). The World Health Organization has predicted that the number of patients with diabetes will double from 143 in 1997 to about 300 million in 2025, largely because of dietary and other lifestyle factors (Ovayolu, 2010). Therefore, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity are the most decisive factors in terms of adversely affecting health-related quality of life.\r\nThe impact of obesity has become an increasingly important public health issue. By the year 2015 it was estimated that over 700 million people around the world will be obese, a problem of epidemic proportions that plays a direct role in chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain kinds of cancer (World Health Organization, 2008). However, obesity is estimated to account for nearly 10 percent of all medical spending in the United States. The prevalence of obesity is increasing in older adults, with an estimated 31 percent of those aged 60 years or older regarded to be obese in 2003 – 2004. The increased prevalence of obesity in older adults is especially concerning given the association between obesity and impaired physical function (Himes, 2000).\r\n With a changing culture facing an increasing number of teenagers with eating disorders, physical activity (PA) provides an opportunity to tackle obesity issues whilst restricting emphasis placed on dieting (Steinbeck, 2001). Certain social-demographics can play a role in the amount of PA a child is able to participate in. Individual, interpersonal, and environmental factors are associated with PA among children and adolescents. Demographic factors include sex, age, and race or ethnicity. Children from less advantaged minority families have lower levels of activity (Gorden - Larsen et al. 2000; Lee et al. 2002). The development of PA strategies that span from childhood through to young adulthood is of critical importance. A substantial amount of scientific evidence shows that older adults who engage in progressive resistance training and aerobic exercise are able to increase muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and bone density (Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing, Lee & Kampert 1994; Lee, Hsieh, Paffenbarger, 1995).  Furthermore, several randomized controlled trials show a beneficial effect of resistance training on muscle strength among frail elderly persons (Kannel, Belanger, D'Agostino &  Israel  1986;  Leon,  Connett, Jacobs  &  Rauramaa, 1987). According to  Keysor  (2003),  PA,  particularly walking, increases muscle strength and aerobic capacity and reduces functional limitations. When considering issues of morbidity and mortality, health cannot be compartmentalized into categories of NCD versus infectious disease. People living with HIV and AIDS are not spared from NCDs.",

Hepatitis is a disease that affects the organ liver –that plays a vital role in keeping our body healthy by removing impurities from the food we eat. Everything you eat and drink passes through your liver.\r\n\r\nHepatitis is generally caused by virus and is classified into five different types: Hepatitis A Hepatitis B hepatitis C hepatitis D and hepatitis E. Hepatitis B, C and D occur primarily due to contact with infected bodily fluids. The primary causes of Hepatitis A and E are consumption of contaminated water and food. Other causes include eating raw oysters or raw shellfish or raw meat - which carry a higher risk of a Hepatitis A infection.\r\nNot all forms of hepatitis are infectious. Alcohol, medicines, and chemical may be bad for the liver and cause inflammation. A person may have a genetic problem, a metabolic disorder, or an immune related injury. Obesity can be a cause of liver damage which can lead to inflammation. These are known as non-infectious causes.\r\n\r\nEating a balance diet plays important role in treatment of hepatitis. The diet should include foods that are easy on the liver and exclude foods that cause the liver to work harder as this can delay a patient’s recovery from the disease.\r\n\r\nFruits and vegetables should be a significant part of any diet to help in recovering from a liver disease. They are full of essential nutrients and are easy to digest. As a bonus, they also contain antioxidants, which can protect the liver cells from damage.\r\nHealthy proteins in the form of low-fat milk and dairy products along with lean meats, beans, eggs and soy products can also be a part of a healthy liver diet.\r\nAvoiding deep fried spicy and oily foods is a restriction the patient should follow. \r\nDrinking more water and healthy fluids helps in quick recovery.",

        "description": "Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by Borrelia bacteria, spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that appears at the site of the tick bite about a week after it occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25–50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months. \r\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes. Usually, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours before the bacteria can spread. In North America, Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii are the cause. In Europe and Asia, the bacteria Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are also causes of the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals, or through food. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Lyme Guide, Lyme Disease Management & Lyme Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Lyme Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Warts are the most easily recognized symptom of genital HPV infection. About 90% of those who contract HPV will not develop genital warts. HPV types 6 and 11 are most frequently the cause of genital warts. It is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, usually during oral, genital, or anal sex with an infected partner. While some types of HPV cause cervical cancer and anal cancers, these are not the same types of HPV that cause genital warts. Some HPV vaccines includes coverage for types 6 and 11 and therefore can prevent genital warts. It is also possible to be infected with different types of HPV either at the same or different times. Although estimates of the number of new cases a year vary, HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active people will get it at some point in their lives. A condyloma acuminatum is a single genital wart, and condylomata acuminata are multiple genital warts. The word roots mean \"pointed wart\" (from Greek κόνδυλος, \"knuckle\", Greek -ωμα -oma, \"disease,\" and Latin acuminatum \"pointed\"). Although similarly named, it is not the same as condyloma latum, which is a complication of secondary syphilis.",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Other causes include direct trauma, certain medications, infections such as mumps, and tumors among others. Chronic pancreatitis may develop as a result of acute pancreatitis. It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats, high blood calcium, some medications, and certain genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase. In chronic pancreatitis these tests may be normal. Medical imaging such as ultrasound and CT scan may also be useful.",

        "description": "Mumps is a viral disease caused by the mumps virus. Initial signs and symptoms often include fever, muscle pain, headache, poor appetite, and feeling tired. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to ten days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include meningitis (15 percent), pancreatitis (four percent), inflammation of the heart, permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling but this does not increase the risk of infertility. \r\nMumps is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among people living in close quarters. The virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Only humans get and spread the disease. People are infectious to each other from about seven days before the start of symptoms to about eight days after. Once an infection has run its course, a person is typically immune for life. Reinfection is possible but the ensuing infection tends to be mild. Diagnosis is usually suspected due to parotid swelling and can be confirmed by isolating the virus on a swab of the parotid duct. Testing for IgM antibodies in the blood is simple and may be useful; however, it can be falsely negative in those who have been immunized. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Mumps Guide, Mumps Disease Management & Mumps Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Mumps Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "description": "Norovirus, sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting bug in the UK and Ireland, is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans. It affects people of all ages. The virus is transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water, by person-to-person contact, and via aerosolization of vomited virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces. Annually, norovirus is associated with 906,000 outpatient visits in industrialized countries, with 64,200 inpatient hospitalizations. In developing countries, it is associated with 1.1 million hospitalizations, with an estimated 218,000 deaths. Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fevers may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days. On surfaces, norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants and polyquaternary amines, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents.",

        "description": "In 2033, the world saw the outbreak of an unknown infection that left most of the human population dead.\r\n\r\nPrey Day is an online, multiplayer, top-down shooter survival game which takes place in a huge city in a world after a zombie apocalypse. An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse? In this zombie game you'll complete quests and explore Harbortown. The best zombie games have rich, mysterious storylines, and Prey Day is no different.

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

        "description": "Porphyria is a group of diseases in which substances called porphyrins build up, negatively affecting the skin or nervous system. The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and last a short time. Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks. Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications. If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure. Most types of porphyria are inherited from a person's parents and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or the bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically by blood, urine, and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.",

They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or the bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically by blood, urine, and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.",

        "description": "Skin Disease Treatments provides medical treatments info including rosacea. \r\nPeople say that beauty’s only skin deep; it’s what’s on the “inside” that counts. Our insides are certainly important, but skin treatment is your first layer of defense against the outside world. Skin can also give important clues to your overall health. Learn to take good care of your skin, so your skin can keep taking good care of you. \r\nSkin protects your body in many ways. The skin provides a barrier to protect the body from invasion by bacteria and other possible environmental hazards that can be dangerous for human health.\r\n\r\nSkin can also alert you to a health problem. A red, itchy rash might signal allergies or skin diseases, and a red “butterfly” rash on your face might be a sign of lupus. A yellow tint might indicate liver disease. And dark or unusual moles might be a warning sign of skin cancer. Be on the lookout for unexpected changes to your clear skin, and talk with your skin doctor if you have concerns.\r\n\r\nYour skin can become too dry if you don’t drink enough fluids or spend too much time in sunny or dry conditions. While washing hands is important for good hygiene, washing your hands too much can also lead to dry skin.\r\n\r\nThe sun can damage your skin as well. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) light that causes sunburn and makes your skin age faster, leading to more wrinkles as you get older. There’s a strong link between UV exposure and skin cancer. So protect your skin from the sun. Wear hats and other protective clothing, use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, and restrict your time in the sun during the late morning and early afternoon hours, when sunlight is strongest.\r\n\r\nMany skin researchers are studying the skin’s microbiome—the bacteria and other microscopic organisms that live on your skin. Some of these microbes can be helpful. Evidence suggests that they boost the body’s infection-fighting immune system and help keep you healthy. But there are some skin diseases with known associations with certain microbes. In the long run, scientists would like to find ways to support healthy skin microbes while reducing harmful ones.\r\n\r\nThe importance of keeping your skin healthy can't be overemphasized. It's the body's first defense against disease and morgellons, and it protects your internal organs from injuries. It is, in fact, the largest organ in the body. The skin helps regulate body temperature and prevents excess fluid loss, and it also helps your body remove excess water and salt.\r\n\r\nSkin conditions can affect anyone—young and old, men and women. Acne, hyperhidrosis and eczema are just a few examples of common skin disorders. The good news is that there are soap notes and a number of simple ways to keep skin healthy, and there also are now many options available to treat skin conditions, if treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer : If you think you may have a skin problem or need to learn how to better care for your skin, consultation with a dermatologist—a physician who specializes in treating the skin and keeping it healthy—may be in order. Don’t use this guide for main diagnose medical books. Skin problems can be difficult to diagnose because many skin conditions share similar symptoms. An evaluation is key to effective treatment.",

A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms.

Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others. Rubella (German measles) and roseola are different diseases. Measles is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of those infected. It may also be spread through contact with saliva or nasal secretions. Nine out of ten people who are not immune and share living space with an infected person will catch it. People are infectious to others from four days before to four days after the start of the rash. People usually do not get the disease more than once. Testing for the virus in suspected cases is important for public health efforts.",
