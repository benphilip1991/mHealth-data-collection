            "While the concept is great and lots of offers to go with it..  Using the Goqii Smart vital with the app is total pain. I have to keep unpairing & re-pairing the watch. It stops displaying notifications on its own. The steps are not updated. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app at least 4-5 times now in 1 day and it's just 2 days since I bought this.  Bluetooth & location are always on & other Bluetooth devices are working fine. Have tried with 3 different phones at home now.",
            "I buy it because made in India. But very dissatisfied.please upgrade the app mainly 1 it should be auto synchronised with a setting may be half an hour or hourly basis. 2 u can just measure every parameters from app only no need to manually check everything from watch. Please upgrade the app and make it flawless.",
            "Its excruciating that when you buy a Smart Vital device for 6K, you are made to endure the pain - called GOQii Preventive Healthcare App..It just pathetic and a sham. It doesnt connect to Smart Vital. I am trying for last 2 days.. It keeps searching for device, then says update profile ( god knows for what) and then it just crashes...and all you are left with are Ads, Videos and shopping promotion. Didnt expect this from GOQii. I hope to get a resolution from GOQii.",
            "I am unable to find a way on how to check the distance travelled on cycling/walk in excercise option..also, there is no integration with map..Can u pls guide whether these features exist or not? Sent request to support but no luck.. Shared the details on email but have not received any feedback yet...",
            "Good Smart as far as the features concerned.. But price is too high.. Body temperature not gets update on regular basis.. Step count is accurate. BP is in accurate.. Battery long for 2 days only.. Most of the time sync loss and not reconnect atomatically"

            "To me, the app was not user-friendly. I found myself entering the same information repeatedly and sometimes the data just would not save (specifically in the Goals section). Second, the format provides low visibility. I was looking for something thst displays data like a calendar with icons and notes to show my doctors an overall picture of my health for each day. This is more like a database that has to be searched by individual criteria. I can't use this app in its current format.",

The very people that extended release medications were designed to treat are being denied their use and offered meds in strength and quantity to last for a few hours a day if any alternative at all.

Further, it is nothing compared to what most see in their provider PHR by Epic and Cerner. As someone who has studied and designed PHRs, it is very disappointing for a health service that bills itself as 21st Century. Perhaps I now understand why they won't let you see the app until you have joined and paid.",

Studies have shown that learning a wide variety of concepts, rather than one concept studied in depth to be the best method for retention so the random assignment of concepts is great. Users asking for a search function need to go use MedScape or Amboss 😜",

Covers most important medical topics for clinical years of the UK curriculum and is useful both as a resource for quick review on the go but also for adding to your own notes/as a primary resource. For anyone who's used passmed it's basically the passmed textbook but better organised and arguably more thorough. Also massive props to the developer - a free app with no ads and great content? There should be an in app donate button!",

It's easy to use an the only thing I could point out that could be improved is that there is an option to manually add favourites.. thank you!"

I try to report mistakes often using their email, but never got an answer or any update in the app.",

            "Now that I realized all the features they have like recording my thoughts and documenting my experience each day, I've found it to be much help in my daily life. I enjoy checking in everyday and one day will be able to look back on all my progress to hopefully help other addicts on they're new journey. Thank you all for ypur support. -Alyssa",
            "Love this app because not only does it have a sobriety counter but it also has a meeting finder that has a lot of listings for both in-person meetings of all kinds and zoom meetings. You can go to a meeting every hour. Not to mention that this app has a daily check-in as well as the option to record your triggers and cravings and you can keep note and a daily motivational affirmation picture oh and you can create your own affirmations put your own pictures behind it",
            "Have tried multiple recovery apps but this one is the best by a long shot. It's phenomenal! With the ability to record my feelings, any cravings, thoughts, and so much more, and share them all with my family and other support I feel like I'll finally be able to overcome my addiction. I'm not one for calling my support team but this app allows for them to comment on a log entry, message me 1-on-1, or send group messages. I highly recommend this app!",
            "This is really the BEST app I have ever used! It's better than i even hoped for, really. I have tried almost 30 other, I can't even say similar, apps but they are no contest! this has everything available all the time any time for any reason! you need to talk to somebody, or to find a meeting, or if you want to read resources or reach out to other people going through the same thing you are, this is the perfect app! I love it! Life changing amazing! thank you for creating it!",
            "Have not had this app very long but what I have got from this app so far i give 5 stars i love everything about this app when I tell me self oh I can do a certain part of my daily program which has been set outside of this app, it seems to fall right on time that this app reminds me that it's time to check in with myself and my recovery and this app prompts me to check in with a heck of a lot more than what I would normally ( but should be doing normally) so its a god send for me"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

I had booked test from thyrocare lab through this app, then made the payment, next day they collected the blood sample and after few hours it showed cancelled in the app without any reason..... I had tried to contact them many times but they failed to give any solution..... I was waiting for my reports.... But after 3 days pharmeasy called me and asking to order another pay for the same and they will test my 3 days old blood sample.... Is it a joke??",
            "FBPLUS coupon not activated after the product delivered. When reached to customer service they have only 1 reply issue forward to concern department. They have not any TAT when the issue resolved or any ticket number for the escalation. My suggestion don't buy with FBPLUS coupon if you think you will get PLUS membership. As they have not any proper channel to address the issue. I was suffering form this issue since last 4 days.",

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "I wish the app covered the amount of any given substance that may be dangerous given a dog or cat's size, health status, etc. I understand they don't want to discourage humans from seeking help when they should, though. One thing I do think should be changed: \"tylenol/acetaminophen\" is listed separately from \"pain relievers,\" and since it comes later alphabetically, a human checking the list of toxic substances could stop at \"pain relievers\" and never see the information they need.",
            "Very informative! I really appreciate the quizzes the app offers to test your knowledge and keep your skills sharp for situations where first aid is needed.",
            "Alot of very helpful information. Life saving information and more! Great app and thanks for it.",
            "🐈 A great guide for cat and dog basic first aid! 🐕 While not a replacement for proper veterinary care, this app is very well done and easy to follow, full of useful info for dealing with a large variety of problems pet owners might face - with not just facts, but also videos to guide you in performing emergency first aid properly. It even has a place to put your vet's emergency contact number for quick reference, and quizzes so you can test yourself on what you've learned. Highly recommended!"

            "Very poor communication so far. I asked them if they needed any more information from me in order to get my birth control, and they have yet to even respond to me. Giving it a 2 star rating for now, but it could easily drop seeing as I just started using the app. Honestly, it might just be best to schedule an appointment with your doctor. 🤷‍♀️ Edit: yes definitely a 1 star. Just go to a doctor please. It's just a huge scam",
            "I am overly grateful for this app. I've been using them for a little over a year and im happy I dont have to see a Dr in person for birth control. They are a rad bit slower to responding to messages since covid occurred but not by much. I've gotten all of my questions answered since I only started pills last year for the first time. Love it! ♡",
            "Convenient, affordable, accessible. Takes them days-weeks to respond to messages. Another week or so to to put the order through, no option for expedited shipping. But then your card gets declined (bank issues, low income, etc.) they lock the prescription until you change cards/message them to re-up the RX. Birth control is something you have to take regularly and it's ridiculous for them to make it so hard and time consuming EVERY time I try to order. Planned Parenthood is still best.",
            "I used to love this app for bc. I needed an emergency contraceptive and decided to get it through this app. It said $20. I checked out and my total was $35 because of the \"consultation fee\" which is dumb cause it's just plan b but hey I'll pay $35 instead of $50 if I got it directly from the store. I picked it up for it to be the regular $50 plus a stupid $15 consultation fee! Ridiculous! Very misleading.",
            "I used them for a couple of years. I have had to change my password three times over the course of three months. Could not get access to my own account due to an error saying that i did not have permission to access this account (after i already changed my password so i knew that was not the issue). I tried reaching out several times and was told to change my password and nobody has reached out to help me since. I have since changed who i get my birth control from."

            "Many of the questions are good quality, but many are dated and use obsolete guidelines (htn, statins, vaccines, especially ones from the \"Mengel\" source) which is super frustrating as a student trying to get the hang of things. Explanations are sometimes minimal with little explanation for wrong answers. The interface is clunky compared to similar apps. App needs to be updated to continue selling with good conscience.",
            "No way to set app to only review questions that you've missed.  I tried using the flag functionality to do this manually (a pain) but even that failed as the app erased all of the questions I had flagged when I changed the quiz settings to a 25 question max vs 50.  Switching back to 50 didn't bring back my flags.  Don't waste your time or count on this app before a shelf exam unless you want to get screwed over.",
            "Nice interface, better than e-book.  Somewhat out of date, e.g. HTN questions are based on JNC-7"

App allow us to see the nearest store where we can get the medicine but that is also of no use, if you found 1 medicine at store \"A\" , you can't get your second medicine at the same store, you will have to go to store \"B\" to get your second medicine and same keep goes if you've prescribed 3 or more variety of medicines. Truly unprofessional service. 🙁",

Preventive services can help keep you healthy by finding health problems early and can keep you from getting certain diseases.\r\n\r\nWhat’s covered will help you answer questions like:\r\n\r\n- Will my Medicare benefits cover services to help me stop smoking?\r\n\r\n- Can I get a cervical cancer screening?\r\n\r\n- How often will my Medicare coverage allow me to get a bone mass measurement?\r\n\r\nAsk your doctor or health care provider which preventive services (like screenings, shots, and tests) you need to get.\r\n\r\nPart A & Part B Costs\r\n\r\nMedicare Part A and Part B cover certain medical services and supplies in hospitals, doctors’ offices, and other health care settings.\r\n\r\nPart A hospital insurance coverage helps pay for inpatient care in a hospital, inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, home health care, or inpatient care in a religious nonmedical health care institution. Copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles may apply for each service.\r\n\r\nPart B medical insurance coverage supports medically necessary doctors’ services, outpatient care, home health services, durable medical equipment, preventive services, and other medical services. Under Original Medicare, if the Part B deductible applies, you must pay all health care costs (up to the Medicare-approved amount) until you meet the yearly Part B deductible. After your deductible is met, Medicare begins to pay its share and you typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount of the service, if the doctor or health care provider accepts assignment. There’s no yearly limit for what you pay out-of-pocket.\r\n\r\nFor some items and services, you must meet eligibility criteria or you may be responsible for paying all costs. Your doctor or health care provider may recommend you get services more often than Medicare covers. Or, they may recommend services that Medicare doesn’t cover. If this happens, you may have to pay some or all of the costs. Ask questions so you understand why your doctor is recommending certain services and whether Medicare will pay for them.\r\n\r\nUse the What’s covered app to answer questions like:\r\n\r\n-How much will I pay for prescription drugs included in Medicare Part B coverage?\r\n\r\n-Does the Part B deductible apply for cardiac rehab?\r\n\r\n-What percentage of the Medicare-approved amount will I need to pay for colorectal cancer screenings?\r\n\r\nWhat’s Not Included\r\n\r\nWhat’s covered doesn’t contain information on Medicare Advantage Plan, other Medicare health plan, or Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) coverage. It doesn’t contain a CPT code search, exact costs on surgeries or procedures, or local coverage decisions.\r\n\r\nMedicare Advantage Plans\r\n\r\nIf you have a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare health plan, you have the same basic health care coverage as people who have Original Medicare, but the rules vary by plan. Some Medicare Advantage Plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover - like vision, hearing, or dental. Check with the plan or search in the App or Google Play Store to see if the plan has a similar mobile application.\r\n\r\nThis is Medicare’s first official app, and we value your feedback.

I could only locate generic topics with no specific yes/no answer relating to me. To me, the answer to a question \"Is covered?\" is a yes or a no answer. This app did not provide it, only \"Topic not found. \" i am greatly disappointed...",
            "When you type in things like Hip Replacement, Knee Replacement, Shoulder Surgery or any other major issues it either comes back with appliances (passive motion machine or physical therapy etc) or nothing at all rather than if that particular issue is covered by Medicare. In other words, this app is woefully lacking in information about what is actually covered by Medicare or at least the percentage covered.",
            "I appreciate that Medicare is trying to make an app to help us know what is covered and how often. However, I am surprised to see that the app was released at a somewhat early stage of development. Compared with the information available on the web site, this app is lacking much information, thus making its usefulness very limited. I will check back every now and then. If the functionality becomes more like the functionality of searching on the web site, this app has very good potential."

Either doctors are not concerned about this channel or they are forced to be on this platform. It does not look like they trying to care on this platform. I kept on waiting for doctor Salecha Priyank Mohankumar on scheduled time of 11:10 AM on Ask Apollo and he never turned up. They called at 3:00 PM for re-scheduling at 5:30PM.",

            "This is pathetic service from Apollo, I have tried 2 times and the experience was so bad.. There is no option in this App for a video call and never received a call from doctor. Only Whatsapp number for customer care is available and they never response to our messages...So don't waste your time and money on booking with this number...",

They offer a significant discount for a one time purchase charge for diabetics $9.99, however, they don't allow online access to the diabetic data through graphs, PDFs, or Excel files without subscribing to a paid plan $60.00 annual charge or more for subscribing monthly.",
            "great app. very easy to use. love the reminders.",
            "I got this App to help count my Carbs. But I am finding I am also loosing some much unwanted waight.",
            "I have the Diabetes & Diet Tracker, and it is very easy to use. I record all my food every day, and the app is very helpful for me personally. Weight loss is made more difficult when you have a ton of emotional baggage like I have. Having the facts - the actual numbers - in front of me helps me stay on track. I also must mention the scanner. It is wonderful!",
            "App works great. Fairly easy to learn and use. Would be 5 stars if it showed a total daily macros on a pie chart instead of a huge layout form that is very difficult to read and quite useless. Like the diabetes carb count, that is most useful to me. Would also like to know how to delete self created recipes but help section isn't very helpful and doesn't explain how. Love the huge database with many foods I use and happy with how easy and quick it is to add the odd new food that isn't there."

            "The front cover of my Nursing Drug Handbook 2021 says \"get the app for weekly updates\", so I downloaded it. The free version does NOTHING! It *should* say BUY the app, yet I bought the book! Why doesn't buying the book give me access to the app?! Also, you can't search for a partial name - if it isn't the full name, it will say there's no matching results. 🙄🤦‍♂️",
            "If I could give it no stars, I would. I bought the paper copy. The actual book costs the same, and it advertised the app for weekly updates, but they essentially want me to buy a whole new book. There are many other apps out there that do the same thing for FREE. Save your money and get the print copy, this app is utter garbage",
            "I love the information once I find the medication I am looking for. When I first got the app, there was a scroll tab at the right to go quickly down the alphabet. Now I have to rapidly fly through every medication title to get where I am going. It is annoying, but worth it in the end. Search never works for me either. I have a Samsung S7 that still works-too stubborn/cheap to upgrade!",
            "This app may be good, but it doesn't work for me. I bought the paid version to have as a resource in clinical. Everytime I open it, it asks me to update the data base. When I do this it goes into an endless loading screen that nevers finishes. If I exit out and come back in it asks me to update again.",
            "This has been a great resource for me. The information about the drugs is the most up to date I can find and the patient considerations are extremely helpful and valuable. Able to look up any medication quickly and look for side effects to be aware of."

        "description": "Sepsis is a serious systemic infection that can quickly lead to circulatory shock, organ failure and death if inappropriately treated. It is also a serious problem in hospitals throughout the US and the world. In 2013, 1.3 million people were admitted to US hospitals for sepsis (#1 cause of index admissions!) at a total cost to the US healthcare system of $23.7 billion dollars (#1 most expensive condition!). Over 250,000 people die of sepsis in the US every year, more than from prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined. Despite its large toll on public health, public awareness of this condition is poor and the quality of treatment is highly variable often due to late recognition and treatment.\r\n\r\nIn sepsis, time is of the essence. Successful treatment hinges on prompt recognition of symptoms, correct antibiotic administration, and hemodynamic stabilization. Lack of appropriate sepsis management knowledge at the bedside leads to delayed symptom recognition, serious complications, medical errors, increased treatment costs, and avoidable morbidity and mortality.

            "Netmeds was good untill last few days. But recently I bought Netmeds First Membership subscription which comes up with many benefits and 1 of them is free basic health checkup. I've requested for the same via email and phone, but every time they say that you will get a call with 1-2 hrs. But, no you don't get any call. This is 6th day and I am still waiting for their response. They are fooling customers in the name of membership subscriptions. Refrain from buying any paid subscriptions.",
            "App sucks. Signing in is a pain in the ass. No sign in using email option available. Everytime I try to sign up, it says email already present, use another email. One should be able to login using same email/phone number. Reviewed after 3 weeks : After placing an order and waiting for 22 days, the order is yet not delivered and hopping between places. No ownership. Atleast u should know the places where u can deliver and not take the order for where u cannot make a delivery.",
            "App interface is very bad. Lots of bugs in app. I can't upload pdf file or any other file. When you consult a doctor and go to the chat room. There will be option to attach report. When I try to attach report in PDF form it doesn't pan out and any jpg format does not seem to be working either. Hope you rectify this.",
            "The App offers some online consultation. I paid applicable fees but has been unable to find any method/ help in the App about payment receipt. Many persons like me need both payment receipt and prescription for reimbursement. Unfortunately, I have been unable to get any of these, despite searching App many times. Can anyone help?",
            "The app is good in terms of availability of medicines and discounts but customer support is just horrible! The customer care executives are there only to give you assurance that they will arrange a callback in 30 minutes but it will never happen. If you call again, it will be a new executive who will again ask you to wait for 30mins! And at one point you will get tired and give up or it will be post 5pm and their office hours will close. Awesome strategy!!"

I have to admit that I was skeptical at first but after my first prescription being filled and the prices that I paid I can only give them five stars. Have patience with the system it works......... you just need a little bit of time to familiarize yourself with it.",
            "I absolutely love this app! I was sceptical at first, I was in pain from a UTI and i didn't wanna pay to see a dr. hey dr just asked me a few questions that took maybe 5 min and my prescription was ready in 20 min. I feel alot better. I will definitely recommend this app if u dont have insurance!",
            "Honestly, at first I thought this was fake, but it's a real doctor's office type thing. I had to fill out answers describing what's wrong with me, and show my ID via picture/camera...then I had to submit a picture of my condition. Within a few minutes, the doctor chatted with me briefly in the message thread of the app.... he sent my prescription to the pharmacy of my choice. It was 11:30 pm so I couldn't pick my Rx up until 8am the next morning, but it was there and ready for pick up. Very nice",
            "so convenient when you cant get to the dr because symptoms start late at night or on weekends when most dr are not around.. and no need to worry about being exposed to covid since you stay in your own home. very friendly and fast service. I will definitely continue to use.",
            "Fast and easy to use service! Was feeling some symptoms for a UTI and I am uninsured. Fearing another $100+ bill from urgent care I signed up for this service and BOOM! $35 and an hour later I received sweet relief in the form of antibiotics at my local pharmacy. Easy to use and quick response time. I will tell all my friends about yall!"

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

Have it installed on a Pixel and the fingerprint recognition is such an awesome, time-saving improvement for logging in multiple times per day. The newest version (5.4) seems to have made upgrades to stability. And being able to manage prescriptions from anywhere is great; I'm not sure how practices manage without having that easy access."

I've the reports, I've the call recording.. wish I could share it here.. Pathetic service..",
            "Worst experience with their service.Not at all professional. App doesn't have review option before payment so after payment only you will get to know whether you have selected everything correct or not. Tracking in app won't work. Call back from app won't work 90% time For refund we need to fill some separate form.Will update if i get the refund. If you want to get test at 10am book it for 7am. Then only they will come at 11 am. Report are scattered.Parameters are distributed here and there.",
            "2 days and not even a single call or email!! They didn't leave my back before the appointment. Once the payment is made, no calls. I'm trying to reach the technician who visited. Even he isn't picking. Nothing is showing on the app as well. The sales guy from Healthians is Gaurav. AVOID THIS COMPANY. I'm going to share this on Facebook and other social channels as well. And if I don't get my reports in another day I'm going legal.",
            "UNRELIABLE RESULTS. Thyroid test results were always higher than normal. We ended up spending more blood, money &time for consultation & re-tests from a hospital. Actual thyroid levels were normal. It will be foolish to trust the test results that Healthians give.We suffered mentally because of these incorrect results for more than a year. These are just glorified sample pickup guys who may use sub standard reagents/conditions to give unreliable results.",

The brain power of this book is what you need to reach your dreams. So there for the ones that disagree much first improve, know how to speak or read English, there's nothing bad about it, it just tells the truth. Being safe then sorry we all need to learn %100 how to understand and communication before they can do that kind of a job and handle other people..",
            "Concerned. You are mis informing people and this can create stigmas. E. G. Hiv undetectable = untransmitable. But you misinform that one can still infect other people..... Once a person is undetectable it is not possible to pas the virus through unprotected sex... (blood to blood is possible) however if hiv+ person contracts another illness or doesn't take the treatment it is possible that vital load can peak and once again be detectable for a period of time. You should be fully informed.",

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nIf you like this app, please share it with other doctors.

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

It also helps me tracks urges, moods, as well as giving a lot of links to some topics that can help in recovery. The only thing I can think of that I would like to see, is that I wish there was a real-time chat. Maybe some type of chat room that we can go in and see if anyone wants to chat (not video)",
            "Great ! I love this app! It's so easy to use and has so much to offer any one in Recovery . I mean it has it all everything in one place look no further. Also the support team that is available to help in your journey to answer any questions you may have is wonderful.",
            "I'm in recovery and have been for several years. I tried this app out. High risk situations part of profile, not helpful at all. I tested it out hoping this could be helpful to my clients. I was hoping it would call or text the person I listed as my emergency contact and had granted permission to call or text her. Nothing happened when I went to either location(neither truly high risk). There are some features that could be helpful to those early in recovery.",
            "I appreciate the sincerity of this attempt. And I really look forward to an app that is genuinely helpful for an addict. I want to mostly encourage y'all, but also want to offer some critique. Packing all these features into one app... Including, for example, a notepad that you call \"Express Yourself\", which you have to click through a motivational message before you can use. There is no use for most of these features, and their inclusion is demeaning to the people who need this. Focus thx",

            "There's a strange log in bug. I have a Pixel 2 that's running on Android 11. When trying to log in, if I don't get a blank notification from My health+ it will just sit on the blue screen with a stethoscope graphic. If you have this issue, I suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the app until you get this blank notification. Do not close it or you won't be able to log back in as I could only get it to pop up on the first start-up. Hopefully they fix this soon.",
            "This app didnt work on my smartphone device. It would.load my personal page. Said my password was wrong. When it wasnt. Tried to reset it, but the reset code didn't work and website said their own reset code was incorrect. The medical advisors told me it would be easy and must be done online. I let doesnt work. The phone number one can call says their is a 3 hour wait time. This is an awful waste of time and needs to be renovated or something.",
            "Updating my review to 5 stars after Intermountain contacted me directly and solved my issue with the app. I have a Pixel phone and a late September update to the app caused a bug that wouldn't allow Pixel users to login. I left a review and Intermountain contacted me directly and updated me when they released a patch to fix the bug. Great communication and I'm so glad I can use the app again instead of the web version!",
            "Was a great app, when I could use it, but now (possibly since my Pixel 2 updated to Android 11) won't launch. Have cleared cache, cleared data, and even uninstalled/reinstalled (including repeating all of those steps right now, on 10/25/2020 with the most recent version that was supposed to resolve the problem), but it gets stuck on the screen with a stethoscope and a spinning circle (the screen that appears after entering your log-in information, while log-in is happening), and will go no further.",
            "Very buggy. Every time I open the app all I get is \"An error occurred\" so it is useless to have. If it worked I'm sure it would be awesome. I got a text saying I have a message in the app but I can't see it. To call in the wait time is over 2 hours. The need for a working app is real both for intermountain and it's patients."

        "description": "Herbal medicine (also herbalism) is the study of botany and the use of medicinal plants. Plants have been the basis for medical treatments through much of human history, and such traditional medicine is still widely practiced today. Modern medicine makes use of many plant-derived compounds as the basis for evidence-based pharmaceutical drugs.

The scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to include fungal and bee products, as well as minerals, shells and certain animal parts. \r\n\r\nREMEDIES FROM MEDICINAL PLANTS IN THIS APP ARE SELECTED MEDICINAL PLANTS OR HERBS BASED ON RECIPES FROM VARIOUS  COMMUNITIES, BEING USED FOR MORE THAN THREE GENERATIONS.

You can also listen to the pronunciation.\r\nMedicine is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. \r\nMedicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture.

With this application, both the Health Professional and the general public can check the ideal dosage of Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2 and Magnesium based on the exam parameters, or even just by body weight. The SmartD3 Application was developed by Life Medicine and Nutrition, and makes it possible to improve immunity, optimizing your Vitamin D3 levels and also improving the biochemical part involved in the metabolism of Vitamin D3 with the correct proportions of Vitamin K2 and Magnesium in relation to the dosage of Vitamin D3.\r\n\r\nExtremely useful and simple to use, SmartD3 has an optimized and intuitive interface. SmartD3 was developed based on versions of platforms already widely used in Germany. Several points of improvement were detected and from that a new version was developed using the most modern in this type of calculation, taking into account the proportions of dosages to raise the serum levels of vitamin D3 by 1 ng / ml, taking care to adjust the loss rate. All references and scientific data are available for consultation in the information and reference section, in the application itself.\r\n\r\nHOW DOES SMARTD3 WORK?\r\n\r\nSmartD3 helps you discover your need for optimal vitamin D3 supplementation. It is recommended that you first perform a vitamin D test. This is important so that you can validate your values. But you also have the option of checking the dosage closest to what you need through your weight.\r\n\r\nNote: The information and recommendations provided by SmartD3 are intended as preventive measures to prevent disease. The recommended dosages may vary for sick people. The requirements of pregnant women, nursing mothers, children and the elderly may vary. The information contained in the application is intended to serve as an aid and does not replace the advice of a doctor or clinical nutritionist.\r\n\r\nVITAMIN D FUNCTIONS IN THE BODY\r\n\r\nThe functions of vitamin D3 in the human body are numerous. Vitamin D3, for example, strengthens the cardiovascular system, affects the function of the thyroid gland and therefore also the hormonal balance and the immune system. Vitamin D3 also plays an important role in regulating your calcium level and therefore supports bone mineralization. An adequate level of vitamin D is therefore an important protection against osteoporosis. The promotion of muscle development and function is also related to vitamin D3. This is particularly important for older people, as they generally have a low level of vitamin D3. In addition, it supports the use of glucose, which is why vitamin D3 is particularly important for diabetics. Vitamin D3 is also known for its positive effects on the mood. Recent studies indicate that low levels of vitamin D3 are associated with mood swings and even depression.",

            "This app has proven to be really helpful. The PUNCH WORDS so far are amazing. I am currently preparing for the NEXT examination. I love reading books, but to crack any exam with a good rank,information should be at the fingertips. Otherwise,while dealing with patients,knowing stuff is not enough. The idea of Punch Words is really different,and it has been helping me so far. I hope that I can get access to all the 1500 punch words soon! I will update this review once I have applied all the tips.",
            "This is a much needed app for medical students preparing for Post Graduation Entrance Examination. This has been helpful for me for the NEET PG Examinations. Particularly, the 1500 Punch Words concept is fantastic and is indeed helpful for all the medical students for a quick revision of all the important points just before the exams. Thanks a lot once again to the creators of MedicalSuperNotes.",
            "hi , first of i think this platform is good, getting directly to what we need and what we deserve, in this short term of using the app i find it more amusing, lastly one thing i want to change on platform is that, the app merely looks like a web page, any improvements in categorizing it would be nice.",
            "Have not used the app yet, adds are annoying, the owner asks for reviewing the item even before using those 1500 keywords. As the owner wants honest rrview right now not in situation to give that have not tried the keywords yet. will update once i use the app n get the keywords.i am preparing for Neet Mds does not contain much about it.",
            "The app meet my expectations .After seeing the post on quora i was a little unsure, because it sounded so good to be true. but after using the punchwords, it's so much easier to prepare for NEETPG, way better than all other coaching material. it's high-yield, compact and user friendly."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "My brother got diagnosed with Aids just a couple of months ago, and everything about the virus was new to us, especially the terminologies. As I was researching about the illness, I came across this app. The reviews were terrific, but I had to see if it will work for me. Two months down the line I am impressed!! I can be able to guide my brother though acceptance period and boost his self esteem thanks to this app. This app has all the information I needed concerning the illness, and I was conversant with the terms. The app is not slick regarding the design and technique, but it does a fantastic job as it is required. I strongly encourage anyone who is suffering from Aids to have this app. It had all the information I needed; hence I did not need to google anything. It has proper punctuation, and it is effortless to use. The best part is it is available in two different languages, English and Spanish.",

They should have the decency to return a call when this happens!!!",

            "App worked great for the first couple of months. Now it won't track my steps. And if it does, it says that NONE of them are convertible. I've also had a lot of issues with steps being converted to sweat coins (it will track that I've walked 12,000 steps but only convert 100). I sent a request for help and never got a reply. Read one of the responses to a review and you guys tell people to submit tickets but you have an automated message respond saying that they pretty much never check it. Wth.",
            "Love this app, its not easy to build sweatcoins but if you save them you can earn some pretty cool stuff. I walk a ton for work so its generally easy to accumulate them. The offers update every few days so it always feels fresh. They also have awesome humanitarian causes you can donate your coins to. I would rate this app 10/5 if I could. Its engaging yet not overwhelming, one of my favorites i constantly recommend the app to my friends and coworkers",
            "Please fix my account. I have exactly 938,814 steps that keep adding up and wont caluculate to the sweatcoins. I have the right setting and everthing and no battery saver or anything. Im not sure if there is a problem with the app or if they are just scamming me when my coins actuly start to add up after 2 years.(update) i uninstalled and reinstalled and its counting again but i lost the 938,814 steps that never got calculated. Is there a way you could put these back onto my account.",
            "Whenever I use this app or hit 2× boost it starts counting steps then it will stop like every 10 to 15 sec for at least 20 sec at a time , the timer is stil going but not counting the steps . I am 67 yrs old and was so excited about this app . Some days its so hard to get started excercising but I make myself so I can stay fit. Please fix this !!!",
            "I've been a loyal sweatcoin user for over 2 years with no issues until recently. The app will continuously stop tracking my steps for no reason. I've re-installed multiple times and it never seems to work. Some days it decides to track my steps though. It's inconsistent, I already contacted support through the app and they didn't do anything to help or seem to care. I do over 15,000 steps per day and I've been subscribing to their 30 coin/month and it's basically been a complete waste."

        "description": "A gallstone is a stone formed within the gallbladder out of bile components. The term cholelithiasis may refer to the presence of gallstones or to the diseases caused by gallstones. Most people with gallstones (about 80%) never have symptoms. When a gallstone blocks the bile duct, a crampy pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, known as biliary colic (gallbladder attack) can result. This happens in 1–4% of those with gallstones each year. Complications of gallstones may include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), jaundice, and infection of a bile duct (cholangitis). Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, dark urine, and pale stools. \r\nRisk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Gallstones formed mainly from cholesterol are termed cholesterol stones, and those mainly from bilirubin are termed pigment stones. Gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms. Diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound. Complications may be detected on blood tests. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Gallstone symptoms, Gallstone Management & Gallstone causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Gallstone Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.
