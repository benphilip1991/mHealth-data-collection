            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

At last I want to tell you this app is very nice please download it and do exercise at home regularly and stay fit. I also thank all those who make this app. This app is very helpful. Once again Thankyou all 🙏🙏😉😉",
            "I absolutely love it! First of all, you don't have to pay for keeping your body healthy like most off the other apps(I got no money). Second of all, it gives you a food planning thing which is really healthy for our body. Third of all, it keeps track of your everyday workouts and your weight. I just really like this app, definitely should get it if you want to lose weight. 😊",
            "It's a great simple app to remind myself to do a little exercise every day. The workouts may seem easy to some, but I find they work muscles that are easily missed during typical weight lifting workouts. With a little know how, it'ss easy to modify the exercises to increase or decrease difficulty. Most of the moves can be performed with very little noise or jumping around. It gets a little monotonous after a few weeks.",
            "Very very very goood app. I live it. I has really worked on me. The coach this app. She is really very good. She gives us tip and directions of the exercise very well. She even mentions where to the exercise like in bed and stuff. I recommend it to every one who wishes ti get fit and loose weight. I swear it really works or effects on u. And the diet plan no words. I really appreciate it and thank u. Keep going.",
            "OMG ! This app is wonderful. First of all we can lose our weight without money. I could loss my weight easily with the instructions voice coach had told. If you follow the exercises correctly you can also find the changes. I will give this app 5 star because of the changes I found while I did the exercises. Thank you very much for Making this app wonderful."

            "Wow! I am so impressed with this App! It's very easy to use. It shows you how to do the exercises and it even counts the seconds for you!!! It's definitely motivating! Thank you for such a great app!!! The only thing I can't work out is how to use it on my IPad or laptop. It connects with my google account and phone thats it..... Be great if someone could help me get it on one of those devices please! 🙂",
            "I LOVE this app. It's AMAZING! There are exervcises for every training. You can even do exercises in your bed and office. This is so convenient and it also tracks your exercise and reminds you to drink water. I absolutely reccomend this app. It also helps you loose weight and keep you fit. Definitely recommend downloading this! Keep up the great work! 👍",
            "Fantastic app with great fitness features! Way better than an app I paid 20$ for 3 months for. Ladies, give this a try. I'm finding myself doing a bit more and more each day. It's fun, easy, and comprehensive, yet challenging when you're comfortable taking that next step and increasing your duration and intensity. Very user friendly: great pause/stop functions and additional direction when you need a move or pose explained in greater detail. I should of just went with this!",
            "Best of all. I have came across several apps to give me a proper plan to stick on. Out of all this is the best. Honest opinion. I wondered how it got high ratings and I downloaded. Ended up giving high rating😂 Pretty sure you will fall in love with this app. Ads aren't that disturbing and the UI is pretty descent. Be honest with the app and it will give u a very good result. Go on with it.",
            "I thoroughly like this app, I do have one issue but it isnt enough to drop a star in my rating. I would like the option to enter in workouts I have done not on the app. I do 20 minutes of cardio every morning and would like to track that with the rest of my things on the app. I will add the water reminder is incredible to have. I hate water and will go days without 1 sip other than to brush teeth so this is a huge help. Over all I enjoy using the app."

            "It's great, the exercises are good and the customisation allows you to adjust it to your level and capabilities, although the ads might be quite annoying that's a good way to keep this as a free to use app. Also the water tracking is great, I always forget to drink water either bc I'm busy or I don't pay attention to it, this is quite helpful.",
            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard 💪.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

            "This is a great exercise app with lots of variety! So far I have tried the splits workout on easy mode, and it has been really helpful. They have three plans - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and within the plan you can choose whether you would like to do easy mode if you're not too flexible yet, and standard if you are. Overall, a very good and easy to use app. 👍🏼",
            "It's a really good app, the progress part, the counting and the tips helped a lot with the performance of the exercise, I wouldn't last a week doing it by myself. It has been keeping me active during quarantine not only the splits part but also the stretching workouts. You just have to be careful to not push too hard knowing the limits of your body of course.",
            "Teaches you how to train systematically, contains simple exercises, easy to follow and remember. I've done all three levels, you might ask if I'm able now to do the splits. I can't, but I understand it's not fault of the app but rather time, which I need more to achieve full splits. At least in my case. Keep training, guys.",
            "Ok so far but only on day 2. My main query is the cost. It was £4.99 to get the app, with no mention of subscription during this process. In the FAQs it then describes how you will be charged a subscription if you do not cancel the subscription. This makes no sense. The one off fee was for the app, and it contains ads so is not a premium paid-for service which would require a subscription.",
            "I'm 60, so I don't expect to get instant results, but I've been using this app for about 18 months and my flexibility is really good now. Also I dont have back, hip or sciatica pain anymore. I highly recommend it, and to keep on going! My splits are just about there. I just keep repeating the advanced stage and trying to perfect the exercises."

            "Great app. I waited till after I was done with the 21 day challenge to review. I did the challenge everyday and I did this with 5 bottles of water and intermittent fasting as well. After the 3rd week I added 35 to 45 min of treadmill and very light lifting 3x a week. I've only been on the scale once. So far I've been feeling amazing no more bloating. My family has noticed my weight loss. I've lost 5 lbs. It's not much but it's a start. Love the app!",
            "I absolutely love this app. During the pandemic I started to gain so much weight and felt so bad about myself. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I decided to change this. Combined with a healthy diet, this app has helped lose around 9 lbs in 3 to 4 weeks. I enjoy the training, the workouts...everything. I personally don't like to exercise much, but I feel pretty motivated to keep doing these workouts everyday, so, thanks for that! Looking forward to keep using this app ♡.",
            "The workouts themselves are easy to follow and you can change your rest time in between to suit your needs while also being able to skip an exercise or pause anytime you'd like. I've not used those functions yet as I haven't felt I needed to. It keeps a great pace and I feel like I've done a nice workout. I'm not sure how the calories burned add up though. Of you're really working hard it might be correct? I like to do the daily workout and then an another one as well since they're short and sw",
            "I've been using for a couple weeks and I really like how simple and easy this app is...gives me no excuse not to work out bc most workouts are just 10mins! I am doing the full body 28 day challenge and it's actually really enjoyable. I feel good after the work out and want to do at least one more. Really enjoyable women's fitness app. Not to much and not to little. Just right for this mom. 💃",
            "If your somebody who is having trouble during the pandemic and feeling a bit of bloating then download this app!! It amazing. It keeps up with your workouts, your diet, and let's you pick what part of your body you want to exercise with or just stretch. It does a lot for you and gives you reminders for when to work out. Download it!!🔥🔥"

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. 😀",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ❤"

I also love the water tracker app. I sometimes go a day without drinking water but with this app, im pretty sure im gonna drink a lot of water and stay hydrated. Hopefully i won't have much migraines. Weldone",
            "The app is incredible. I have completed 60 days and now I have started again from beginning. I recommend this app for all those who are above and below age 18. Though my height haven't increased yet I do this daily because exercising everyday is good for health. I hope that my height would increase some day as it depends on each one's body hormones. I have some suggestions for your app. You could add some yogas, some music, the tips of the process of inhalation & exhalation in every exercise. 😘",
            "It is a nice app . I think I can increase my height with this app .It have lot many exercises without any equipment, wow 😍 and have a planned diet and sleep tracker too . It's very helpful app. But the reason of giving it 4 stars is that in diet ,it includes lot many non veg things which I hate 😠😡 actually. You should ask this thing in introduction before planning when you ask about age ,height, etc. It will be better if you do this change. Plzz ,accept my request and do make change.",
            "Amazing i think it is going to be a good trainer and animated images and videos are also given in it. It not only tells about exercise but also about nutrition plus sleep and every exercises are increase and daily new tips of nutrition is also given with it. I think it will increase my height and the further after2 months i will post about it but i liked the app very much😘😘",
            "It's great experience to show how much you can stretch and get height this is my second day training I've grown only just a tiny bit I think but I'm getting their confidencre guys never give up or don't believe always believe in your self. I think this is a helpful review for other people to understand what to do and in all workout apps too."

            "Love that it didn't ding after each exercise and they are timed so you can go fast and get lots of reps in or slow and less. I also like that I don't have to touch my phone except once to stay the whole routine. It plays through each exercise with just a few seconds in between to catch your breath. All in all great app!!",
            "You have an option for a single morning stretch routine and a single nighttime one. And you have a 30 day thing that gives you a 7ish minute workout regimen...and that is it unless you want to pay. Looking for a different app with more options for free.",
            "Worst experience ever. I was charged twice on a subscription service I never use before. I was charged the highest amount on this app for 1 year without any consent. During that 1 year, I still had to watch ads, so what was I been charged on? Can't find any contact to feedback this problem. Recieved no service but charged at the highest amount. Disappointing",
            "For a beginner it was hard but I pulled through, it wasnt sooo hard.. I would definitely recommend it to my friends... I love that I don't have to pay or subscribe to get fit, anyways that is why I cannot afford to go to the gym",
            "This app is so great to use because it actually makes you sweat as it said on the title thank u very much for making this app, One of my goals was being skinny, not fat,chubby, or thick, lol, I just want to be skinny thank you again who ever made this app, there's a glitch on every app like this when they tell you to pay every what ever day or month just get out of the app and then go back in and it will let you keep on using that app with out paying anything"

            "I have been lazy so far, telling myself that it takes a lot of time to workout. But with the introduction to this app, it has made my life so easy! 7 minutes and I feel super strong. I have only been using it for a week, and I can already see the difference in my body. I'm much more active, AND I'm getting the required workout in just under 10 minutes! That's everything we require in this fast paced world ♥️✨ 5 stars because it's super easy to use, with clear instructions! Thank a lot!!",
            "\"7 MINUTE WORKOUT requires one or more Google Play services that are not currently available. Please contact the developer for assistance.\" I was trying to connect it to Google Fit, but no luck. It is not registering my progress to Fit. I like Google Fit and I found your application to be quite good. I would be really grateful if you could tell me of a workaround or a resolution for this matter. In case you cannot solve the progress transfer from this to Fit, please give a detailed reason.",
            "This app is helping me stay fit. In this fast paced world, where we struggle to get some quality time to invest in our health & wellbeing, this 7 minute workout is a blessing, to say the least. As the app claims, I believe it truly gives you \"maximum result with minimal investment (of time)\". I would highly recommend this app to anyone who desires to stay fit & healthy!",
            "A few years back, when i think this app was still very new. I could remember vividly how the app looks like before. It was 2014 maybe? I was just 13 and i almost had juvenile diabetes. I used this app and maybe a month??? I lost significant fat percentage. I am back to downloading this app again which is kind of a bummer. The app is very effective. I highly recommend it to everyone",
            "Great plans, but impossible to transfer data. Doesn't connect to Google Fit, doesn't support Google (or any other) backup... Smart Switch isn't supported either. I'm about to lose 230 days streak because I have new phone and it is very demotivating."

Also one of the workouts I did that was only 14 mins was some how recorded as 44 mins. So just little things. Apart from that, the instructors are amazing. Very knowledgeable people doing what they love it seems like. It's entertaining and encouraging 😁 I would recommend",
            "This app is awesome! They have a whole range of different types of workouts from low to high impact. Cardio, toning, endurance, strength and great stretching videos. Everyone and anyone can do this app, even people with injuries. You can choose from quick or longer workouts. I highly recommend joining, they have so much to offer for free and there is also a membership option. Only thing I'm disappointed in is that it doesnt sync with fitbit app. But regardless, this app is a must for sure!",
            "This is one of the first fitness apps I've used that actually has challenging workouts for myself plus a ton of free content. I love how there is an 'ongoing' workout plan so you don't have to figure out what to do next after your '4 or 6 week' plan ends. It also seems like there is new videos being uploaded daily so I'm looking forward to see if I get any repeats in my weekly workout plan. Overall I think this is definitely one of the best free fitness apps out there.",
            "Love this app, have been using it for a long time. But there are a few major design flaws that should have been fixed by now. Flaw #1: If you choose 12 week plan and later decide you want to extend, it resets everything (ie. It says you are on week 1 and keeps none of your past progress). #2 If you choose the \"Ongoing\" plan, you can't plan past 12 weeks. Once you hit 12 weeks, it just adds on one week at a time making it impossible to plan past the current week. Super annoying. Need to fix ASAP",
            "So far so great! The workouts are timed perfectly just the right amount to get you the desired result and you can always do another if one is too short. Secondly, the instructors know what they are about and motivate you so that you dont want to stop. A much better way to workout as your calories loss is right in front of you and your heart rate is calculated as well. Loving it!👍👍💯"

            "I have used this app for a month and feel great. Some exercise in the beginning were a challenge my body just did not move in that way. I stuck with it and did the best I could laughed at myself. Now I can do most and have explored with other 7 minute routines on the app. My schedule or calendar stopped working but the weight tracker did not . So I make sure I exercise everyday ! This is a great way to exercise if you have a busy life and can not fit in the gym or hour long workouts ! Love it !",
            "the user interface is very clean and pleasing to see, it's very easy to find videos that are suitable for us as well as the estimated calories burned. one feature that i specifically enjoy is the daily workout! however, the day format is incorrect (it is one day behind, but the date is correct. e.g: monday, 29 sep. it's supposed to be tuesday). the other workouts seem to not have music like the daily workout. please solve this, thank you very much for developing such a helpful app! ☺️",
            "I've always had trouble losing weight, especially after having 2 kids, and self image but this app has helped me so much. I've been using it since about mid July beginning of August and went from 190 --> 175 so far!😊 Very happy I found this app, it's helped me so much! Would recommend 100%. It's got from beginner to advance workouts so you can start easy and work your way up and get better!",
            "I could never stick to a workout plan, but this app makes it fun to workout./ The only thing I dislike about the app is that after you use for like 2 weeks the calendar seizes to exsist, so I dont know. I used to use it to keep track of how many days I worked out. So when it disappears, I just deleted it and downloaded it again. Its annoying.",
            "As an 18 year old young woman who struggles with self-image and motivation to work-out, this app is perfect for me. Long and hard work-outs intimidate me but 7+ minute workouts (beginner to advanced) is just what I need! I can take as many workouts as I need while also tracking weight + BMI everyday, these small easier workouts can definitely help me build up to the harder and longer workouts. I feel great, I am so happy to have found this app. Also a bonus is music that comes with the workout!"

There's also a calender to track your training. I cant imagine what the paid version offers. This one has it all, you can create routines and target specific areas.",
            "Perfect for getting back in shape! Not going to lie, it was hard getting motivated, but this program is easy to use, fun and works magic quickly. My first 4 days (with Flat Belly Diet), I lost 12 pounds and 5\" in waist (47\" to 42\"). I feel great!!",
            "Really really good app covers all the bases and is tailorable to your needs. The only reason it has 4 stars not five is that there is not sufficient explanation of the exercises. Would deffo get a five if that was provided As an idea for improvement it might be nice to add some gentle music in the background while stretching.",
            "Used it first time this morning. Did the back stretches for 10 minutes... I literally feel like a different person. If there was a pay version to remove the ads at the end, I'd totally do it. Great app and look forward to telling people about it!",
            "Excellent easy to use app, exercises are direct and programed for user friendly experience, I like the idea of the instructor showing the movements before each exercise. Thank you for the App. 👍"

            "Been trying a variety of fitness apps trying to find one that did what this app does. Being able to simply track your progress on each exercise, seeing your previous results for that exercise as you do so, is simple but effective. For me anyway. Yet other apps do not do this simple thing. I recommend creating a custom workout, you don't have to do them on particular days or even in order, but it helps organise the exercises you do and in groups you do them by.",
            "Completed with clear video (of human doing exercise, not animation only) and description of which part of muscles affected. I love it! Edited: Unfortunately I cannot save the data to the cloud, therefore I won't have any data backup and restore the data if I change my smartphone.",
            "Love the app. It keeps track of everything you need and help you focus on the training that matters. I'd give 5 stars if it had: (1) the option to share custom exercises with other people (a temporary link/QR?) (2) The support for gifs (and videos?) when adding a custom exercise. Please keep improving and don't abondan the project! A pay wall is maybe okay, but please add an option to pay for removing the ads that is not a subscription!",
            "It completely missed my expectations, I was looking to get some level of flow and kinda coaching approach where this is only the data collection app with multiple bugs and issues. (Eg. Exercise showing as double, timer can't be switched off without closing the app, no reps option) Also it lacks flexibility in customising your workouts. Unfortunately I've paid the subscription for 1y :( Another app that is lacking trail option.",

            "Good exercise routine feels sore after workout. 5 stars for the routine. Forgot to include rest days I guess😅 Some features are bad. Countings are really worst. The Home workout app from the same company is good. Try to improve like that one. Demonstration videos are mostly animated which are disappointing coz they demonstrate from only one view it impairs with the form. Demonstration videos from expert trainers would've been better. Please improve this leap fitness I know you can do better.",

This is the by far the best workout app I have used I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a little guidance and/or workout plan to keep them on track!",

Disabling auto countdown voice doesn't help when exercise goes ahead on it own. Just get rid of it please. Ughhh also Please fix calorie estimates. A 50 min session reports 900 Cals which isn't correct",
            "I think the app needs a function where you can choose alternative exercises that targeet the same muscles. Because some of the exercises might not be suitable for the person, like me who dont have a bench at home, so I cant do dumbell bench press or dumbell pullover.",
            "Hi, I've been using Leap Fitness Group apps for the previous three years, and all of them are great. However, this one particular app has something really bad which is why I deducted one star- it's animations. The animations are so bad even my little brother could make better ones. I would prefer if they just used their previous animations; the ones in this app are cra"

I cannot believe this app is free. It is my all-time fave.",

Counting from 10 just makes me irrationally angry. It would be nice to be able to set it. At the end of a 1 min planking rep, counting down from 3 or 5 gives me hope while 10 just makes me mad...",

            "A nice app with lots of options to customise workouts and reps. Really glad for the voice that announces what move is coming next as I always forget and the beeps for each rep. Has helped tremendously in setting up a simple stretching routine to help with my recovery from a back injury.",
            "I've been using this app for my back for years. I didn't realise I hadn't rated it!! Great app. It's really helped me with my back pain as I have a bad posture. In particular I always use the \"Stretching the spine\" exercises.",
            "At my age and 40 really only concentrated on upper body weight training in past. Thankyou so much for this app! Good option for a simple workout or with an added workout! Life saving stuff, encouraging and easy to follow and stay focused.",
            "I suffer from lower back pain ever since I got sciatica from a back injury. These small workouts actually work better than my rehabilitation workout. A minor delay between the rep countdown and the animation, but better to work at your own pace anyway and do how many you're comfortable doing.",
            "It is a great app to work on all parts of your body. The only disadvantage is that when you want to make your personal plane is gets difficult to order the exercises. I mean moving them up and down one by one is time consuming."

            "It is excellent app for workout!! But reason for not giving one star more is that I would like to see some extra features also. For example, simple and healthy food recipes varying from country to country, drink water reminder and some tips to be healthy..😇😇",
            "I have used this app for just 4 days and can easily see why it is so highly rated. Has set workouts to target muscle groups, keeps time of your workout, keeps record of it, shows you a video if are unsure of how to do the workout and even reminds you to workout. What more can one expect. Highly recommend it, great job developers!",
            "Honestly, I appreciate all the work put into this app and most of all that it is free. A lot of workout apps have great stuff that cost a great price. Not this. There are so many options to choose from and everything is laid out for you. I highly recommend getting this!",
            "Love it. Really helps me to get a workout at my own pace. Starts kinda slow, but I just double up if the workout does not seem too hard. Very nice overall"

            "i really love this app from then til now .it was so effective. i can feel my stomach muscles and body muscles aching which means it's really working. and i like how it makes my heart beat faster and i love it too when i'm sweating when i do the exercises 😄😊 it's really working guys!! i recommend this app to everyone who wants to be fitty & witty🥰😊",
            "I am trying it now for the first time. No matter how good might the exercise be, the app itself is quite bad for some reason. (starting as intermediate) 1) you have no chance whatsoever to learn the exercises before beeing forced to do them. 2) you can not go back/repeat the exercise 3) is not taken under consideration that you have 2 legs (some exercise you have to do twice: one time with leg1 then leg2)",
            "It was just over the top awesome. I will DWFINETLY use it again. Who ever made this app they did an awesome job. I am so proud of them. They deserve a great big pat on the back. I can't tell you how much I really love this app it is just amazing, awesome, just great. So thank you to whoever made it.",
            "This app is very good, I really like it. I just feel like when the exercise is about to start there about be like a 3sec countdown so that a person can adjust, position and see the exercise been done.",
            "Exercises play too fast. And they are not instructing how to do it, when to switch sides etc. Only reason i have this app is the exercises are great. Need improvements"

I'd probably recommend this. The exercises are really hard! Which makes it easier to lose weight & faster. Exercise for 30-60 days, And then you should lose weight by then. Awesome app I love it!! I'm trying to lose 10-20kg. And it'd be a great opportunity ☺️. As im young myself, And love wearing crop tops. Thanks!!",

I am the only one that ises this app and would not use any other the other ones lady's voice is annoying and even gets you distracted. Tou should definitely install this app",

            "My true purpose for trying this app was to help with digestive issues I've experienced for the past two years. Figured, why not? This helps! Matter of fact, I would rate it top 3 of what is putting my system back on track. I've been using this app for about 8 months now and I absolutely love it. As of right now, at almost 50 and normal weight, my pelvic muscles are on point. ( Sorry if that sounds awkward.) This app keeps me focused and, oftentimes, I meditate through these exercises.",
            "Simple, effective. This has 2 simple types of Kegel exercises, performed after each other. It builds repetition and time slowly each day. Perfect for post hysterectomy. It gives a discreet reminder on my phone. I have the app set to vibrate times during exercises so I can close my eyes and concentrate rather than counting or watching clock. I HIGHLY recommend.",
            "I love this I have tried doing legal excercise on my own but would not feel like I was doing them correctly. This app shows me how to make progress. I have been doing this for about a week and can feel the muscles getting a little toner I guess you would say. I am not sure how to say it. I just feel it working",
            "I like the exercises in this app for basic squeeze-release kegels, and that they slowly progress each day without you having to advanced them, much as a personal trainer would do. My only two gripes so far after using it for a few days, and why it fell short of five stars, are that I wish there was at count down before beginning the exercises like 3-2-1-go, and I wish you could set reminders to do the exercises multiple times a day.",
            "Ads are not intrusive at all. Design of app good. Can do anywhere and noone knows what you're doing. The graph is encouraging to try and get yourself up the levels! Straightforward; thank you!"

The exercises are of a reasonable difficulty, and there's enough variety and rest days built in that doing my workout is never a chore. There's a diet module that helps you meal plan that I have not yet used, but you rarely see that feature in other free apps. This app has helped me maintain my healthy weight, which is all I can ask for. Highly recommend!",

I've trimmed down from 230 to 185. As you start seeing results, proper diet becomes a focus. This was a plan I never had. Excellent",

            "This is the least user-friendly exercise app I've tried. I do like the stretches and progression for flexibility. However, there's no option to change the time between exercises, but if you skip to the next one, you don't get a countdown before starting. There's no description of the exercise to make sure you're doing it properly. Most annoyingly, it's really unclear whether certain movements are intended to be repeated or held for the duration of the exercise.",
            "Great app but I'll give it a four because it doesn't have the instructions it just have the pictorial representation and doesn't tell us if we have to alternate from side to side immediately or every 60seconds",
            "Amazing app.My mom actually wants to use it and its not that hard to use so amazing app.Also with pretty simple stretches and this is coming from a gymnast.The only thing i would add is personalized workouts and stretches",
            "I'm trying 30 day. I also practice pole dance so my muscles are dead all time but hopefully it will work for me in few months. I don't expect to magically split my legs when I have 0 flexibility, and I read some comments here that work outs on repeat.. that's how usually would do stuff + add something extra after a while... I wouldn't really read most of the ratings here and just try it out on yourself. If you have 0 flexibility try 90 day program and repeat on days off- will update in 2 months",
            "Great app, i think it really helps with the flexibility and doing a split. But the exercises are the same everyday (and adds one new exercise every time), and since I'm doing the 90 days challenge, (i'm on day 25) that's a little bit boring...but thanks anyways"

I thought, maybe a morning routine, nighttime routine, neck stretch routine etc. 50 should cover all bases. Great! But don't be fooled by the terminology. I paid for premium and there is still only 3 workouts. I can't see any different between free and paid. Did they mean up to 50 extra exercises? Disappointed.",

            "Tomorrow will be day 30, intermediate level 2. Despite all of the glitches in the workout software (miscounting, timmer jumping) this is a very good workout that we have thoroughly enjoyed doing. If the issues with the program were to be resolved I do not doubt this could be No1 as a fitness app. A rest day every 4 days and a rest after each exercise, so not too demanding. Lots of variety each day in the order of the exercise workout. Developer make improving this programme a priority.",
            "Fantastic for the abs and core . I'm weak in this area so the timing on the moves and rest is perfect and pushes me everytime . Have never been this sore in the right way in my abs in so long . I'm fifty years old and can still do all the moves no stress on the back or joints .",
            "I ve been using this app for 2 years now, went through many updates and improvements during the years. I found the app real good on keeping me motivated, tracking my results, and pushing me to do a bit more every week with number of repetitions increases or extended time per exercise. I use it as a routine after 2 years and it's a staple part of my workout. For beginner may feel a bit too much the number of exercise, but that's how you do it, to get that 6pack",
            "Thank you for this wonderful app.i have been using this from 2weeks and I am able to see changes in my abs......but I also recommend to play some music so that it will not only easy the workout but also it will make the workouts enjoyable. But u cannot expect abs by doing only exercises from this app.u need to do cardio...take proper rest. Fat cells first start decreasing from arms,chest,back,legs and then it comes to belly... So people do not loose hope. ALL THE BEST🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤛🤜👍👍👍🏋️🏋",

Some of the kids they have eated so many junk food then this app is for them. I am very happy to do this exercises.",
            "App is good. But it's all too quiet when using it apart from the sound of whistle. Can be improved with voice guide. Can you also vary the workouts? Also can't seem to tell the difference between easy, medium and hard modes. But the app works really well.",
            "So I love this app but can you give rewards to make them feel happy for completing the exercise and can you give more explanations on how to do the type of exercise like in videos not in pictures because I did not know what to do or like what movements to do but I love this app can you pls add a calendar on what day you exercised with the app. Hope you read this.",
            "It is nice app, and works properly and all the exercises are useful,and I found this app between the other workless apps,you can use this app,it's great",
            "Ok so this app is amazing because it has lots of great things to do but the reason that i gave it 4 stars is because lots of children connot do the splits and lots of children cant skip anyways its a nice app please download it. Plus theres no ads which is pretty awsome if you ask me right!!!!!"

The only (computer generated) voice-over is a continuous \"one - two\" counting, which is at the exact same tempo, irrespective of the exercise, be this a smple and easy head turn, or a much more difficult and time consuming toe-tuch. Not only that, but even with static streches (e.g. a quad strethc), the developers didn't bother to omitt the ridiculous and confusing count.",

            "Exercises are easy but not very diverse. So far I can only choose from one set of exercises but it looks like theres more later or maybe you have to buy more? Biggest thing is I wish you could turn off or mute the voice, but its nice that it doesnt mute your music on your phone, just plays over it. Mostly good, just wish it had more options and controllability.",
            "this is a great app to use before workouts, in the mornings and in the evenings. it loosens up the muscles without making it feel like its a actual workout. it would be cool to have a small variety of warm ups to choose from to avoid getting bored of doing the same one all the time but other then that its great."

I wish this was all workouts for free. Yeah and also liked the fact that there's some kind of boxing and kicking too.",

I have some physical ailments that I exasperate by pushing myself to exercise beyond my comfort level, but the exercises in this app were simple and accommodated the beginner. Also, I'm learning to stop/modify if an exercise causes a painful strain. The animation, the descriptions and the exercise demonstrations made it easy to follow and keep up. I will definitely continue to use the app."

            "In the middle of the workout, after skipping a few exercises because I finished them earlier than the timer, the app asks for premium membership to skip the next one. So, on the free version I would wait for two minutes without doing anything. Also, it didn't stop until I forced it to stop, to find a notification in my notification bar that I couldn't remove until I uninstalled it. It's a very annoying app.",
            "I suggest adding one thing . When i start a workout, i make a group i call it warm-up , and i put several exercises . Then i make main exercises and make it loop through 3 sits . I want to loop through the main exercises without looping through the warm-up group. How can i do that ? Other than that , 5 stars.",
            "Excellent app for HIIT/circuit training. OK for strength training, but with a few tweaks it could be great here too! Pros- Simple to use Easy to create your own workouts WearOS compatible Cons- Can't reorder elements of a workout once input Can't log notes/weights during workout With a few small changes I'd replace my strength logging app with this. As it is I might let the paid version lapse back to the free one.",
            "I really like the free features, especially the wear-os compatibility. I would totally buy this if if it had a sane $5 buy the app price or something, but there's no way this is worth getting locked into a $34 a year subscription for. Good features, idiotic premium scam.",
            "The app is cool. The best part is it keeps log of our all the cardio/Hiit Sessions. Though one draw back is when I am signed in into the system the data sync process is not upto the par. Have to signout and sign in to get the previous Data"

Otherwise great job.",

            "We looked into this at week 13 of pregnancy and I'd like my week numbers to match but the app wouldn't allow me to. I'd have a week one, two etc when I'm doing my best to keep up with 13 that I'm on. The dates are backwards with no ability to turn them around. It's just a bunch of numbers that frustrate me. If it was 2 April or 7 Jan at least then my mind wouldn't have to be addled figuring. When looking for insights I generally don't like mundane distracting confusion.",
            "Thia rating might change later on as this is the first impression. The ball appears in the majority of the exercises. I don't own one, i don't have space at home for it and i don't see there's an option for alternative. I had better hopes to use this app, now I'm demotivated again to start moving after such a long time."

            "Have only used it once so far but i love this app. Easy to follow along. Layout is easy to understand. First app in a very long time that i found with a clean logical layout. Well done. The excersizes were easy enough to do that i was not intimidated, short enough to not get bored or overwhelmed yet long enough you feel immediate results. So far overall a wonderfull app. Thank you.",
            "I love the yoga moves and I love the way it presents everything. My only complaint is that it doesn't tell you when the individual exercise is complete so I'm stuck having to stare at my phone instead on concentrating on the exercise watching for the end so I know to stop and get into the next exercise position. I would give 5 stars if that issue was fixed.",
            "I have used this in the past, having gone through rehabilitation of my body after not having been able to walk for a week at all to using one leg for 4 months after a femur fracture and kneecap fracture, this helped me to regain energy and flexibility and lose weight. Now years later after giving birth to a baby I am using this again. Same results, works so far, added edge i need to my routine! Thank you to the creator and all involved in this app and all related apps, great job.",
            "The routines are workouts that challenge your abilities in a healthy way. I feel good afterwards. Doing a routine every morning for awhile will definitely contribute to weight loss long term and improve my flexibility. Also convenient, all you need is a nice quiet space and maybe a yoga mat. Looking forward to continuing to use it."

            "App works very well. However, I really need to see a calendar overview of days where I can allocate different routines to different days. The notification is helpful but it doesn't help to properly schedule and visualise your upcoming week of workouts. This would be a really useful feature to add so that I can continue to use the app.",
            "So far, this is the best app I've found for building a routine. As a beginner, this is very important to me. I was able to pick exercises from the extensive list, set up sets and reps (along with rest intervals between them), and put them in the order I want. I also discovered the countdown feature, which beeps to let you know a time period is ending. There is one feature, though, that I would like to see added: An alarm. Let's say I want to exercise at 3:30pm. I'd like the app to set off an alarm and open the routine at 3:30pm, so I don't have an excuse for missing a workout other than choice. Add this feature, and you become 5 stars!",
            "Currently the best workout planner app I've ever used. The free version is already of high value. However I would like to see features to allow you to group multiple sets, in order to check off a single checkbox. Because in this regard, the app requires too much attention; and excessive checkbox ticking gets annoying over time. And because of this, I get the idea that the app, does not respect my time in the gym. Also creating workout plans should reject the constrains of our Gregorian calendar and trying to fit your whole workout plan within a 7-day week. I personally opt for a more flexible plan that cycles over to the next week and the next, etc.",
            "Solid workout planner. It allows you to easily plan and execute workouts. Could use some improvement, like ability to reorder exercises during session (like when gear is occupied), add an extra set during session and the interface could be more polished here and there. It's still good though and I don't know any better.",
            "For a free app, it doesn't get any better than My Workout Plan. It contains many built in exercise options and you can filter by muscle group and equipment. This allows you to build your own routines targeting the muscles you want using the equipment you have, including just using your own body weight as well. 5 stars all day."

It starts with hip workout but you have to watch three separate videos to unlock the 30 day squats and 30 day lunges and the 8 min abs. It has a 30 day work out routine with days of rest but here are my issues. 1. I dont mind watching the ads as long as I dont have to do it again. 2. I cannot track my progress or enter my height and weight like its blank. I click the weight and nothing. Thats the big one😡",

            "This app is amazing; I was searching for the one which would work for me and finally sealed the deal with 7. I'm a busy men and with just one 7 min exercise a day I've seen amazing transformation of my body. Kudos to 7 developers! Just one minus, doesn't sync with external devices i.e. my Samsung watch, Google fit only hence 4 stars. PS. I recommended it to my wife, and she started using too.",
            "Honestly, this has been my favourite workout app. In other apps I followed the 30 minutes routine and I didn't even sweat, but in the 7 minutes workouts of this app I truly feel like my body is working.",
            "I've been using Seven for a few days now and I'm really enjoying the experience. I had been doing 20-30 min exercises every day in another app and rarely breaking a sweat, so I was pleasantly surprised to be sweating with just 7min using this app. The workout animations are very helpful and the vocal coaches are fun and motivating. The only issue I have so far is I wish it would give you a minute rest between 7min cycles so you can catch your breath and a drink.",
            "Lots of benefits at the free level. Works smoothly, and the fact you only need 7 minutes makes it easy to follow through on my good intentions.",
            "The whistle sound is a bit compulsive...when I turn off narrator for a quieter session occasionally (while playing ambient music), it sounds particularly sharp. Everyone have different preferences, so it would be better if the app gives other options such as bell, ring etc., or simply allow choosing a lower volume for the whistle sound."

            "I love this app. It allows me to change an exercise easily without skipping a beat. I don't jump because of balance issues. It gives it something else other than jumping jacks. I do the cool down after my Kettle Bells workout. Today I have no stiffness after yesterday's workout. Considering I am 75, that is very good. I am proof you are never too old to take care of your body.",
            "I have a problem with the UI of this app. I sometimes accidentally tap the figure, which means a new exercise pops up. The \"previous\" and \"next\" symbols look misleading, because instead of prompting to return to my previous exercise (because I suddenly clicked it), it just shows a whole new exercise. Much worse, it even increases the timer. I don't know what's going on with the coding. Even the timer has a problem too, because it goes to negative when the timer passes. It looks lazily coded.",
            "I lift weights. This app allows me to tailor a warmup to every weight session. And it walks me through the cool down and stretching.",
            "It's a great app that gives u a set of exercises to warm up before ur main exercise, but it would be much better if it gave a small description of how to do each exercise when they tell u to do them. A count down at the end of each exercise would also be helpful.",
            "It is an amazing app with great exercisers. I use it every day and i love it!!! Thank you for making it."

Wish it had a flexibility/ stretching option for \"type.\" I have been using the strength as the type, but it still would be nice to not have 30 second stretch interfere with the data for reps. Same complaint for exercises that are for time. But it's really not THAT big of a deal. Overall, great app!",

The only thing I dont prefer is the AutoCap of the first letter when creating a new exercise etc. I automatically do this on my own text keyboard and the tool reverses my natural habit.",
            "Easy to use! The only thing I wish it would do is connect with my Fitbit. There isn't one exercise I haven't found not already downloaded. To me more advanced if it had pictures or description of the machines to know which exercise your logging (i.e. abductor vs adductor). Other than I really do love the app!",

For each exercise, number of reps is the minimum info needed, with options to easily track weight used (if relevant), elapsed time, and notes. Does what it says - well named!",
            "Very nice to use, once you get past the learning curve. The developer is very responsive. Very customizable. For example, for exercises I do at the gym on their machines, l prefixed the exercise name with initials of the gym to keep them all together. I set up a routine for each day. Exercises can be moved around within a routine. Your data can be exported by the app as a .CSV file (which can be read by any spreadsheet program) to your email."

            "I had a few glitches with this app, notably when casting to the tv. I like the routines but was dissatisfied that some of the workout classes you couldn't save to use again - apologies if you can, I couldn't work out how! The other issue I had is that like most other apps there is a lot of squat exercises, not good for me, and an alternative is often tricky to find. Sad that so much is only available to subscribers, I haven't renewed for the above reasons, and I'm not interested in the meal plan",
            "I like the classes, but feel sad about not having them available on the weekends. The workouts are good too, but I am still trying to figure out how to create a routine for the week / month, that is complete and balanced. I found this app is not very good at providing that. The previous app I had was very good at setting up a 3 month program and I did not have to figure out what to do everyday, plus I felt I was working towards a more clear and oriented goal.",
            "Great app! Changed my life :) got addicted to online workouts.. Good diversity, awsome trainers, you can choose the workout level and type easily. Highly recommended!!",
            "I've tried alot of apps to help motivate and hold me accountable and 8fit is the only one that has worked for ME! I love that it starts your work outs at the level your at. It has alarms, recipes, and I can log my daily work outs to hold myself accountable. I use the free version right now but will upgrade when I reach my first weight loss goal!",
            "I enjoy this app. It's good for keeping my workouts on a schedule and helps me stay motivated. I can track not just the guided workouts I've done through the app, but also the workouts I do elsewhere. I'm not even using the premium version, either. I likely will get it, though! The classes it offers look good, and being able to access recipes would be great."

The exercises, I can keep up with them, but not always do them 100% correctly, because some of it is quite tiring or needs a bit of exercising experience. I am struggling with some of the food on the list, but i am very determined and i just do it. I am day 5, and i got on the scale, i could not believe! I don't feel i have put on, but the same scale that showed 51kg 5 days ago, now shows 54. Worth every effort!",

I am guilty of leaving it unused on my phone for a while, but now that I have started using it daily (max efficiency, 500XP mode), I feel like there's some improvement already in a week or so.",
            "To the developers, Nice app. Really helpful. Just a few things I'd like you to look into: 1. There is no pause button during workouts. And if BACK, HOME or lock by mistake, and then return, the 1 min timer gets restarted. Some workouts don't work properly altogether after this problem. 2. To activate any plan, we need to click on the SETTING button. However, the SETTING button of the DRY EYE PLAN is not working properly.",
            "Love the exercises. Unfortunately the Learn part doesnt seem to work properly. Visual acuity gets stuck displaying an object or letter (no questions or feedback) , Eye quiz and Accomodation say to swipe for next question but nothing happens when I do that. Kaleidoscope feature works. I remember these features working. I have a huawei p20 lite with android 9",
            "I wish the exercises reflected realistic daily routines. I wake at 5am normally, and 10a-3p is more late morning/afternoon. Broaden the time restrictions on the compiled exercises, please. I would be inclined to use the app way more.",
            "the exercises are nice and well put together. However, I can't judge their effectivness as the app \"reminders\" don't work, so I often forget to do the exercises on time. If it gets fixed, not only will I give it 5 stars, but will look into buying some of the plans."

Vedic Exercise / workout\r\nVedic exercise and workout activities can keep the back healthy by letting discs to exchange fluids which makes it easy receives its nutrition. A healthy disc gets swell up with water and squeeze it out, just like sponge.

That said, as a free app it does well.",

            "Love this. Brilliant app for tracking workouts at the gym. Developer, is there any chance that you could add a feature where the timer function goes to a negative timer if you run over your rest time period, so you know how long over your rest period you've gone? So if I select a rest time of 30 seconds. But I rest for 45 seconds. The timer would read -15 seconds. Hope that makes sense! Thanks for reading. Matt.",
            "A great fitness app. Love seeing the graphs of lifts and the breakdown of parts of the body hit by the exercises. The use of this app alone has allowed me to push my self harder and get better lifts. It is great to see the past data and get over the psychological barrier of a lift when you know you have the data to back up the jump in weight. Overall phenomenal app and I'm super happy with it",
            "Best app for tracking gym and cardio hands down! Really straightforward and simple to use, dont even need instructions. Best of all gives more stats about you than you even need! Love this app! Please dont stop developing. For improvements maybe make widgets, possibly showing improvements for each body part? Also maybe smart watch support",
            "Really like this app. Edited on 9/23/2020 I've been using this app for over a year now and find its the best workout log app I could find. I tested quite a few others but they all have their flaws. I really like how you can easily access your history for each exercise so you know what weight to use and how many reps you need to do for a PR. I also like how they allow you to create full routines, unlike other apps which just allow you to create a individual days or workouts.",
            "Great app! I've been using it since 2016 and the features are extensive yet so easy to use. Being able to chart really helps with seeing progress and motivation. It's fun to say that lifted 1 million pounds last year, or that I did +600kms of cardio... all with pretty charts! I just had to register as a supporter. Hoping one day other apps can integrate with this one such as Google, Samsung, Huawei and Runkeeper."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "At first it went great. Variety in the exercises, and I could end the routines complety, according to the specified time. After a few weeks using it, it started crashing before ending the routines, so I had to start over, and pretty much repeat the exact same exercises I had done, hoping it wouldn't crash again (which it usually did). Just correct this, and the app will be amazing.",
            "Its great app but it can use some slight changes. Like a countdown timer before starting the exercise. Beginners like me cannot get all the information they need about the exercise from the gifs. It would be great if you can include some tips about how to do the exercises correctly. Giving out tips during the workout using voice works even better.",
            "I've use this app 5 days a week with dumbbells for about 5 months (HIIT 30 min.). I'm a pretty fit person and find the workouts to be very challenging and rewarding. I've noticed a huge difference in my muscle tone with legs after 4 months. And I've never had better looking arms due to the tricep push-ups! My abs look great too. To prevent glitches, make sure phone is fully charged or plugged in.",

It's undeniably good. Keep up the good work! I'm proud of you! My experience in using this has been more than gratifying. I recommend it to every one.",
            "One of the best FREE fitness apps. No intrusive ads and only a one time payment if you want to get rid of ads. My only \"issue\" with it is that I feel like no matter what category you choose (HIIT, cardio, plyometric) the exercises are still kind of the same. But hey, can't hate cause it is free and IT DOES make me sweat"

The workouts are easy to follow and I it doesn't make me do the workouts to the point where I usually would quit. It starts slow enough for me that I actually keep doing it and look forward to the next one even when it's my Day to Relax.",

        "description": "Looking for an easy flexible stretching app?\r\n\r\nIt isn’t late to toil for flexible muscle. \r\n\r\nIt's not enough to build muscle and achieve aerobic fitness. You need to think about flexibility too.  \r\n\r\n“Stretching Exercises - Flexibility Training“ app gives you an opportunity to improve and as well as maintain your fitness through flexible movement of your muscles. \r\n\r\nWe assure you easy learning with the best stretching exercise. \r\n\r\nWe also make sure for your choice of compatibility,                                                                        hence why  “Stretching Exercises - Flexibility Training“  is available offline. \r\n \r\nThis app offers you a free stretching workout.  \r\n \r\nUser friendly UI for smooth experience.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy stretching is important\r\n\r\nStretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints.\r\nNowadays stretching exercises play an important role in sports training, during warming up as well as during recovery.\r\nIncreasing flexibility through stretching is one of the basic tenets of physical fitness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits of Stretching\r\n\r\nFlexibility\r\nStretching improves flexibility. The more you stretch, the more you move your muscles, and the more flexible you become. Over time, stretching will become easier for your body which results in improved flexibility.\r\nPosture\r\nStretching is also beneficial to improve your posture. Poor posture—a common and increasing problem—can easily be reversed and healed with daily stretching. Because stretching strengthens your muscles and encourages proper alignment, your body posture will be less slouched and more vertical.\r\nInjury Prevention\r\nThe more you prepare your muscles for any exercising movement, the more your likelihood of injury is decreased. When your muscles are warm and stretched, movement becomes easier and more fluid-like which helps with injury prevention.\r\nIncreased Nutrients and Reduced Soreness\r\nMost people know that stretching increases blood supply, but they do not realize that it also increases nutrient supply to muscles. Because stretching allows blood to flow through your body, the nutrients in the blood are being carried and spread out all throughout your body as well. An increased blood and nutrient supply also helps reduce soreness.\r\nIncreases your range of motion\r\nBeing able to move a joint through its full range of motion gives you more freedom of movement. Stretching on a regular basis can help increase your range of motion.\r\nIncreases blood flow to your muscles\r\nPerforming stretches on a regular basis may improve your circulation. Improved circulation increases blood flow to your muscles, which can shorten your recovery time and reduce muscle soreness (also known as delayed onset muscle soreness or DOMS).\r\n\r\nFeatures \r\n- Stretching exercises cover all muscle groups and are suitable for all people, men, women, young and old\r\n- Create your own stretching exercises routines by replacing exercise, adjusting exercise order, etc\r\n- Voice coach with detailed animation and video demonstrations\r\n- 100% FREE! No locked features\r\n- No equipment needed, training at home or anywhere anytime\r\n- Dynamic stretching, stretching exercises for flexibility, warm up exercises, stretching routines, Stretch for runners \r\n- Helpful easy stretching exercise  for better flexibility of muscle. \r\n- User friendly User Interface for seamless experience.",

            "I just downloaded this app, and I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews on many issues. First of all, I have MS, and I was looking for an app that will work my abs while sitting down. This app does not do this at all. It mainly works the arms. Then it does not have a voice magnetism at all only the music. You have to watch the screen to know what is next and how to do it. At hee end, the app stopped working. I am definitely uninstalling. Looking for another app for the abs.",
            "I love this app! I lost my entire left leg and have gone from an independent, active person to someone who has to rely on another for 80% of daily activities. This app has given me hope and encouragement that, even though life has totally changed, I can be active and feel positive about myself and what life will turn out to be!! THANKU SO VERY MUCH",
            "My daughter is very weak and problems standing. This app is wonderful, I just wish the exercises model moved a little slower. Thanks",
            "This was great for me. I haven't been able to get any excercises in for a long time due to health issues. I actually broke out in a serious sweat. Thanx for having this app",
            "Love this! I am recovering from double knee surgery and needed to find a way of exercising without causing pain or damage to my knees. My hear rate was raised and it's really fun to do ! Obviously the more effort you put in, the more you're going to get out of it"

I'm 68 years old and been doing kegel exercises for a while and I have complete control of my muscles so no accidents of not being able to hold my urine and having leaks which can be embarrassing.",
            "The app is super easy to use. I've been doing it for almost a month now and I can feel a difference! After having 3 kids, I can say that it has helped me to not pee every time I cough (sorry if that's too much information but it's reality!) And my husband is definitely a fan as well! The only thing I would say is that the easy workout was just too easy, is definitely recommend starting with medium or even going straight to the difficult setting.",

With technology's evergrowing pace, i always feel pressured for time and as if time is moving exponentially fast when really its not. That being said, this app gives my body another outlet to resort to when my mind needs to meditate and still feel useful.",
            "Just did my first workout.Can't complain of anything. Very simple design. But not hard to figure out. Could use a little more of a modern touch in the design department. But so far great praise for being easy and practical for the newcomer:)",

            "Great app, just missing integration capability. It has great exercise routines for every part of your body, plus you can build your own routines. For the yearly membership, this is a great deal, the interphase is well design but it is missing a very important part for me, the ability to connect to other apps like Fit, Samsung Health and so on. If it had that option, this app would be wonderful. Hopefully that feature can be added before my membership ends of not I may have to go.",
            "I need the ability to set the timer for my sets not just rest intervals. That's because I need to limit the set duration. The problem is this: if I forget to click the \"did it\" button, then the whole workout falls apart as the rest interval doesn't start automatically after I finish the set. I have to be able to set time limits for actual sets not just rest intervals. This little thing makes this nice app completely useless for me.",
            "I have been really enjoying using the app so far! Though one thing would really push it over the top for me. I think it would be really nice to have the ability to let yourself know that next time you do an exercise, next week let's say, that you should increase the weight. Either with a little green up arrow that you could check that would show up next week, or being able to add notes to your exercise routine. I find I forget sokmetimes and there's no note function for each exercise.",
            "I paid for the full version to give it a long go. It's okay. But, its planned workouts are repetitive, 16 workouts exactly the same really makes gym time boring. Previous app (Fitnessbuilder) kept changing up exercises for variety in a plan. There's no easy easy to see what you did the last few exercises to see if you're making progress. There's no easy to take notes on an exercise ; sometimes you do poorly and want to add context, sometimes you're at a hotel gym and have to adjust weights.",
            "So far it's ok, I bought the premium for a year before even using the free trial. To start, you have to figure out your weights which I guess is understandable. If you try to do workouts other than the one they tailor for you, it gets kinda confusing. Alternates between 2 days but there's 6 blocks. No real guidance on the app. Also during my tailored workout today the app glitched 4 different times, forgetting where I was in the process and making me start over. Fairly frustrating."

I even wrote an email explaining this issue along with screenshots.but i didn't get a response. This would be the best app if the problem is solved. Hope you address this issue.",

            "Updated Review: the issue with restarting the monthly challenge has been resolved meaning I upgraded my review from 4 to 5 stars. This app does what it's supposed to with no promises of insane growth. You gotta put in the effort and challenge yourself and you will feel the changes in no time. Especially with these often underworked muscles.",
            "Great app! The exercises are great they target the needed muscle groups, and another reason why the app is great is that there arent many back -at home workout (no equipment) on youtube, and thats why i vot it in the firsr place. The reason i dont give 5 stars is that theres always room for improvements ;) Cheers",
            "The app is great it shows great representations of how to do the workout like insteas of showing a cartoon figure it shows a a really impressive 3D model of the a person doing the workout your supposed to be doing the downside is that it doesn't tell you tips on if your doing the workouts correctly or not but so far my workouts have been hard which means i was doing them correctly i think but overall this is a great app i think if anyone interested in back and shoulder muscles should get it",
            "This app has helped me so much with my back pain! I used to be in constant pain and having used this app for nearly a week, it's all but gone! I also love that it has easy, medium and hard modes, a lot of similar apps only have one mode that a beginner like me would find too difficult - but not this one, I like it a lot. (Although there are a few exercises in it that require a little more space than I have in my tiny bedroom)",
            "It's a great exercise app that lets you keep making progress on your own by letting you choose the exercise time , so there's no more excuses about not having time to work out. I would of given 5 stars but the lack of a voice coaching you if a little bit of a let down because if you're working out at home you need to keep an eye out for your phone otherwise you'll miss the end of an exercise and the begging of another one."

            "My eyes were very dry and tired from reading my computer screen and after just one session of exercise immediately felt 100% better. Great app! Why didn't we know about this all the rest of our life?!",
            "I've had this app on my phone a year now and enjoy using it very much. I find the exercises quite useful and relaxing as I'm on the computer roughly 12-to-16 hours daily at home. It has reduced eye fatigue and improved my vision significantly. A very useful tool with adjustable schedule and exercises for multiple daily use. I highly recommend it.",
            "Very useful! I'm someone who's been to a few eye doctors and this feels right.",
            "When I relax myself and read the instructions and then do it. My eyes fell refreshed. This may not work for everyone. But I noticed that while looking at my devices I very seldom blink my eyes or move my eyes around, I just steady stare. But this APP needs to give me an option choice, if I want a pop-up to remind me to exercise my eyes. And then let me automatically return to what I was doing.",
            "Even though some comments says that we can't read what is written while you're exercisesing it vibrates I tried it the first time and I love. 5 star💗💗 I feel refreshed every time I use this application"

The only option it lacks is the ability to schedule workouts. Add that and the application would be flawless and great to use for working out.",
            "Love the app. Noticed a couple bugs. Low Side Plank L is associated with the low plank leg lifts audio. On a training plan, round announcements after the first and before the the last are weird and seem like a concurrency issue. An example is, \"Round Squats 2 40 seconds,\" where it should probably be, \"Round 2, Squats, 40 seconds.\"",
            "Runtastic decided to kill all their apps (including paid versions) in exchange for this all in one dumpster app, which collects way more of your personal data in exchange for much poorer functionality. The cycling exercise is useless for MTB, since it only reads gps data so often so all your turns and curls are recorded as a straight line. The push-ups tracker.... wait... there is none, only the dude showing you how to do push ups(seriously?) no counters, no trackers, no goals to set & reach",
            "The app is great up until it crashes or you get a new phone requiring a reinstall causing any progress pics along with your past weight stats to be lost thus making the option of progress pics pointless. Pretty annoying I can't store the images in the cloud along with the workouts especially if you're paying for the app. Really would be 5 stars but this is now the second time I've lost all progress pics. You're better off just logging your own stats and taking photos with your regular camera app",
            "Paid for the membership version. I like the ability to set reminders and hit what are pretty challenging workouts. My problem is some workouts don't issue out breaks... which seems pretty unreasonable considering the amount of work from the previous set. Another issue I notice is the cool down stretches are the same workout after workout regardless of what exercises you just did... I.e. a focused core/ab workout should not need to focus on the same cool down stretches as lunge heavy workouts."

Flexibility training.\r\nStretching may not be the most exciting part of working out, but doing flexibility work is just as important for a well-rounded fitness routine as strength and cardio work. Incorporating some stretching exercises into your workout schedule will help you improve flexibility, reduce tightness, and ultimately, make your workouts more efficient and safe.\r\nTight muscles can cause undue strain on the neighboring joints during normal daily function, or they themselves can become injured,\" Sasha Cyrelson, D.P.T., clinical director at Professional Physical Therapy in Sicklerville, New Jersey, tells SELF.

To have variety you need to increase the minutes of the stretch session. The other problem is that the app suddenly ends the session when using it, this have been happening for some time. It may happen when I almost finish the session or in the middle of it. Overall good app for stretching and far better than many others out there.",

I could even see faces in cars, except those with dark tinted windowscreens. I couldn't see the 3D image in the app. Maybe one day I will.",

            "Pros: I could feel my (left) eye discharging tension as I did the exercises. I didn't realize how much stress my left eye had been holding. Definitely a very helpful app. Cons: I would like to see a note at the end of the exercise encouraging the continuation of the exercises by expanding the range of motion. I.

My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

However, one of the times I paused, the app crashed and sent me back to the beginning. The exercises themselves were great, but I was fantastically unimpressed with the app.",

            "Nice exercises, not too hard but not to easy so you can get the effect. I really like rhe nutrition section that tells you what food you should eat and what it gives you the most ( protein, calcium, vitamins, etc). Great app would reccomend",
            "App is good but there are some big problems in it first the list of the nutritions and food is not complete and there should be way more things in there second u didnt mention how to eat them , boiled or cook or ! just giving enough information that which way would make the most out of the food third i saw some people do the exercises wrongly and for that u should add youtube link for teaching how to do the exercise and not just a short gif i change my rating when the update sovled them thanks",
            "Haven't even started the workout yet but am already impressed by the setup i have seen so far, i feel really positive about this,and if it does work as expected i will come back to make it 5 stars.. Kudos to the developers!!!",
            "Unfortunately it is impossible to increase your height after your body has finished growing. Your final height is programmed into your DNA. Sure improper diet and lack of exercise can have a negative effect of your growth, but this is only during childhood. An adult cannot increase height in anyway. Everyone in the reviews who has seen height change since using this app, are still growing and would have grown to that height regardless. Please dont let these people capitalize on your insecurities",
            "It is an amazing app which is my best app, i have downloaded. Thank so much mate for this programme. There is no AD. Actually, there is, but it's very less than other programmes. I liked this programme's reminder more. I hope this programme will include editor's choices 👍☺"

            "few options, paid for premium for a while, super not worth it.. Cool, was waiting for the lame corp. response so I'll expand. Consistently the app will fail to put rests in seemingly randomly. Basically any of the useful content is behind a $9/month paywall. And I would hope that it is a fraction of a gym membership because it's not a gym membership, it is an app. Avoid monthly sub apps, they are there to steal your money. If the product was worthwhile it would be a one time payment $50 or so. Several of the instructions are incomplete, exercises are routinely mislabeled (the little man on the screen is doing one thing while the title of the exercise is completely different) go, run your damage control again.",
            "Not for me App looks well built and will be good for some people. I was looking for an all in one fitness hub. Unfortunately there does not appear to be any way of inputting any fitness work not covered by the apps built in routines. I use an exercise bike for cardio and this app as no options for that, so the whole fitness tracking part falls down.",
            "I'm a super overweight woman and decided to start getting a bit fitter and lose some weight. Tried this app for a week and it was so awesome that I bought a whole year. I love the little tutorial videos for every exercise and the huge amount of exercises available. Love that you can make your own workouts. I started one of the plans and so far it has been great too! I mirror my phone to my tv which helps a lot so I don't have to keep looking at my phone. Yay technology.",
            "Best exercises. Believe me It will make a hot body out of you. Your body will gain heat in the very few minutes of the exercises. In my case, i am doing Insane Six Pack Workout. Very Appreciative app. It has all custom options. Including custom workout, timing workout until an hour and more",
            "Excellent app. We are using the free version, and there's more than enough on there for solid workouts that really improve your overall fitness. Interval training, HIIT, plyometrics and more, along with free weight sections, yoga, stretching and warm ups/cool downs, all of which can be tailored to the individual (length of session, equipment used such as barbells/dumbers/resistance bands and so on). You can mix and match, add exercises, and follow a number of preset programs that focus on specific areas of fitness, as well as bolting on a couple of additional workouts each day to bolster the calories burned. The 12 week Full Stack program is superb; at first I was dubious but by week 6 or 7 I saw noticeable improvements, and by the final week I felt fitter than I had done for about fifteen years. This has done wonders for me during the lockdown period, and now I really look forward to using it four or five times a week. Not one to leave reviews, but this is great and deserves all the plaudits it is getting."

This app takes so much of the burden off and lets you just enjoy the yoga session itself. Talks you through each exercise, has timer and even considers rest time between each two exercises which you can skip if you want. It also has a toturial video for each exercise. You can costumise each exercise and it's order and duration. Thank you👍 💯 Great job,👏🌟",
            "Awesome app! Not too many ads - only a few; and i love the fact that it has an easy, normal and difficult mode for user's level of experience with yoga😊. I'm still working with the easy mode right now, but with time, i hope to progress into the normal and subsequently, difficult mode. Thanks!",
            "I'm not completely certain that all these poses and exercises are completely legit. It seems disorganized and you need points for basic features. Overall, it has personalized workouts and gives you a good one.",
            "I just installed this app and as a beginner it's perfect. The exercises are not hard but very effective. You can feel the difference. I had shoulders and neck pain and by the time I was done with my first day exercise, I felt relieved and relaxed. Thanks so much for this app. It's amazing for now. I hope the rest of the time will be as amazing as my first day.",
            "this is a very great app by the time i couldn't go to the gymnastics so i decided to try yoga at home because of covid 19 and i weighed more and more and more so trust me this is even good for fitness and flexibility and health well i am just 16 but it still works even in the younger ages too"

            "Reduce the rate from 5 to 1. For the paid version you can customize your workout but you cannot back it up. So I open a ticket two months ago and no one contact with me !!!! Great app for TRX training. The only issue is the fact that the built-in training is for advanced. So for beginners or for anyone who want to custom his own training need to pay one time charge to get it. Now that I have my custom trainings it become great for me. The actual training can be synced to google fit.",
            "The worst training app I've ever used. 1- there is no way to skip the rest time to start the workout. 2- there is no progress bar, you don't know where in the training you are. 3- there is no pause, if you exit the app it restarts. 4- you can't tell if the timer is for rest or actual workout. 5- skipping an exercise is not quite clear. 6- can't go back to redo the exercise.",
            "Overall satisfied! Links to Google fit and the workouts are intense. Only problem is that I am using the full body workout and everytime the exercises are exactly the same, in the same order...",
            "Great app. Would be 5 stars if you could pause the workout to transition from hands to feet in straps. There's no warning so I always miss the first set trying to get my feet right.",
            "Great simple app with animated demos of each exercise and a good variety available. I tend to preview suggested workouts then pick the exercises suited to me so don't really know how the workouts themselves are, but very pleased with it for what I use it for. Could be improved with suggestions to make exercises easier or harder according to your level, but for a free app I'm certainly not complaining. More diverse models would be a huge improvement, currently only thin & muscular white bodies."

            "Updated - the new interface is a massive improvement. It now shows the goal for each exercise, your personal record, and the overall goal (where relevant). I love the option to start the timer for each exercise as well App was great, but has stopped showing targets for each session following a recent update, now only showing the overall end goal. Means you can't see what you need to do to build up in each iteration.",
            "It's an amazing app. The best calisthenics app you can get. It teaches you all the basic skills. Each skill has a series of workouts that is designed to get you stronger until you reach the point where you need to progress. It then opens up the next level in the skill. you then start over until you're ready to progress again. The workouts are timed and all you have to do is follow the workout and enter your reps or time. It even has a timer built in. It makes calisthenics SOO much easier.",
            "I like having something with multiple levels parsed out. The reward feeling is more often that way motivates me to keep it up. I would love to see Thenics give the OPTION to sync the work out data with Google Fit. Google fit tracks other connected fitness apps (like my stretching app). I hope i don't need to over explain the benefits of having all your workouts compiled to one central location. If I was choosing a new calisthenics app today, that would have been a key factor. Think about it?",
            "Great workouts all preprogrammed for you. Need very minimal equipment. Almost everything can be done at home. Good for any level.",
            "Hey guys,the app was amazing and very helpful.it's very good but it's will be more amazing if it's have a workout creator. Thanks for the app."

        "description": "How to Do Kegel Exercises for Men\r\nIf you do Kegel exercises on a regular basis, then you can substantially strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. By having strong pelvic floor muscles, you may be able to reduce urinary and bowel incontinence and improve your sexual health.[1] Before you begin practicing the exercises regularly, you must learn how to do them correctly. If you are unsure, then contact your doctor. Like any exercise, start out slowly and gradually increase your stamina over time.Do Kegel exercises before receiving treatment for prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nHow to Do Pelvic Floor Exercises\r\nThe pelvic floor is a group of muscles--in both men and women--that support your spine, help control your bladder, and help with sexual functions. By identifying your pelvic floor, performing Kegels (a popular pelvic floor exercise), and practicing other pelvic floor exercises, you can rehabilitate these muscles. In time, you can gain the benefits of a strong pelvic floor, including reduced urinary incontinence, less back pain, more control of your core, and better sex.\r\n\r\nHow to Do Kegel Exercises for Women\r\nKegel exercises can improve your sex life and help with pelvic floor problems, including urinary and fecal incontinence. The key is to get in the habit of doing them every day so you start to see results.\r\n\r\nKegel Exercise Description and Routines\r\nBasic Kegel Exercise Descriptions\r\nBeginner Kegel Exercise Routine\r\nIntermediate Kegel Exercise Routine\r\n\r\nHow to Do Reverse Kegels\r\nKegels are well known for their ability to tighten the pelvic floor, reduce incontinence, improve sexual enjoyment, and help with childbirth. Reverse kegels can also help with these goals. Each time you do a reverse kegel, you relax, lengthen, and stretch the pelvic floor, which may help to relieve pain or tension in the area. Men and women can perform reverse kegels, and you can do them anywhere without any special equipment!\r\n\r\nHow to Do Kegel Exercises for Pregnant Women\r\nKegel exercises, like other exercises, help strengthen muscles. The muscles that are strengthened by the Kegel exercises are located in the lower section of the pelvic region and are responsible for holding the pelvic organs in place as well as controlling the flow of urine from the body.[1] Both of these are important for pregnant women. Due to the increased size of the uterus and the weight of the growing baby, this area of the body is under stress, which can sometimes lead to bladder leakage and other issues, To do Kegel exercises, you will need to find the muscles and then practice engaging them.\r\n\r\nHow to Treat and Prevent Incontinence with Kegel Exercises\r\nKegel exercises can strengthen a woman's pelvic muscles and ligaments. For best results, more than three sets of Kegel exercises should be done every day.\r\n\r\nHow to Do PC Muscle Exercises\r\nThe pubococcygeus (PC) muscle is the muscle that stretches from your pubic bone to the bottom of your spine. Strengthening the pubococcygeus (PC) muscle can help both sexes treat urinary and fecal incontinence, as well. PC muscle exercises are easy daily exercises that will help strengthen your PC muscle.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises: A how-to guide for women\r\nHere's a step-by-step guide to doing Kegel exercises correctly.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises for men: Understand the benefits\r\nKegel exercises for men can help improve bladder control \r\n\r\nKegel exercises (also called “pelvic floor exercises”) strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.\r\n\r\nWhat are Kegel exercises?\r\nWhy do Kegel exercises?\r\nFinding the pelvic floor muscles in women\r\nFinding the pelvic floor muscles in men\r\nGoals and benefits of Kegel exercises\r\nHOW KEGEL EXERCISES WORK\r\nHOW TO DO KEGEL EXERCISES - A STEP BY STEP GUIDE\r\nSIGNS OF PELVIC FLOOR STRENGTH IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nI will be so gratefull if you download this app and give it 5 star and share it with your family and friends. via rrnshams@gmail.com\r\nThank you.",

            "Its awesome, I found how many forms are there in yoga, even for beginners. Its nice to calculate that we are not that fit as we feel. We always need improvement and this app help us to improve ourselves without straining our body and mind. Its quick, helpful and in long run,its beneficial. I love this app.",
            "I think it's a great game you should download it it really help me right now I've finished day one and the wrist workout oh I help me alot cuz my right wrist use to make the crack sound when I spin it and now it totally fine. I use to stress alot with that wrist and now l'm clam thank you plz make more games like this and also... I've been looking for a yoga app for a long to and now l've found it.",
            "I like this app and I am using it at the present.But, there are some yogasanas which are told wrong like I saw in PAVANASANA....and also the 3-D figures don't show the proper manner of doing the asanas which sometimes puts us in doubt what to do.. Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq 🙏🙏",
            "This app was awesome until they gave it 3d models that made the poses way more confusing. Deleting the app and looking for a easier to understand version. Seriously what's the point of having 3D models if they don't clearly illustrate the actions?",
            "Not at all satisfied with the app! The timing is too fast that the beginners are unable to go with flow , does not show the position before the counting."

            "I really like the workouts, but there's SO MANY ads. Seems like recently there's been even more, it's basically unusable. (In fact, some of the ads will NOT close so it IS unusable. Thanks Yahtzee. 🙄) At this point, I'd pay money to get rid of the ads. Instead, I guess I have to get rid of this app.",
            "So far it's good but it keeps turning down the volume during the ads and not turning the volume back up again - I'm listening to podcasts during the workout. It would be nice if there was a paid version with no ads available. Also the calories figures are very over estimated.",
            "Great home workouts. Would like a little more explanation on some of the exercises as haven't done any for a long time and wanting to do it correctly especially when starting the app. Other than that would highly recommend it.",
            "I just installed it, I haven't started exercising yet, becuase I'll be starting tomorrow, but I looked thought it and I love the exercises they give you and how you can change it to random, which means you can change the exercises. And they also have a night time workout before you go to bed, and I look at those exercises that was really good (maybe even help me sleep). But I give this is 5 star, I can understand why 5 million people download this, becuase this is the best workout app ever!!!",
            "Love the 21 day challenge. Was looking to get back into \"working out\" after many years and this is a nice gradual start with pre and post warmups, and 5 min/day workouts. Plus the meal plan design with its shopping list is a great guidance tool. The app itself is easy to use and allows to pause to set for the next workout and it keeps track of your weight as you go through your goals. Nicely done."

            "First time I tried this app. Very different from the majority of apps, and I've tried many of them. You define the time of the workout, the videos help a lot, exercises are varied and work all of the body. I will definitely stick with this one for a long while. And the premium subscription is very convenient. Good job!",
            "Works fine for what I need it for. Working out without doing the hard work of manually creating a routine. They're ready set all i have to do is adjust the time I want to spend and what part of the body I want to work. Perfect!",
            "Really good, and allows you to determine intensity and length of workout, AND say how you found your workout so that next time it's automatically easier/harder for you. And you can play music in the background whilst using it 😁. Would be better if it sent you a daily reminder/had a scheduling tool incorporated into it.",
            "Jesus! This app drills you.. I'm certain you can achieve results in just weeks.. You get to choose the time you want to work out for and it just keeps the exercises rolling in for that time frame.. Really intense (even though basic exercises) and great.",
            "Great, just started using it 3 days ago and already I feel change, I was weight lifting for about a month which came really great with this app. I have more energy, doing exercises that I wasn't able to do before. Maybe it will take more than a month, they say : It takes 4 weeks for you to see, 8 weeks-for your friends to noticeand 12 weeks for whole world to see. Just when it's hard and you want to give up DON'T, because that is when changes are happening. 👍👍👍👍👍"

            "I like it but it also annoys me for one small reason. In order for your reps to be counted you have to let the time clock roll completely through then actually put in how many reps you did and save, per exercise. I suppose it makes you accountable, shows that you are present, but still annoying. *edit* I figured out what I did wrong. I love it!",
            "Forget the upgrade. The ad says the upgrade will give you music. Sounds great but all you get is a bell ding to get you started. Save your money. There doesn't appear to be any refund available.",
            "Only 2nd day but I love how simple it is to use the app. The picture and descriptions and timer are just what I need. I like the idea of 5 min even if I want to extend it I can but if I tell myself just 5 min per set of exercises for some reason it seems more doable than saying I need to go workout for xx amount of minutes.",
            "I just did my first workout with it. I love the instruction and moving pictures it gives along with a detailed description of how to perform the workout. Only thing that needs improvement is I'd like to hear a beep when the time runs out so I know when to stop rather than having to look at my phone constantly. Great mini workouts though which as a busy mom of 3 is super helpful.",
            "Good app with lots of workouts. The fee wasn't cheap, but it's an investment, just like one's health. The app needs two features. The first is some sort of feedback when the user taps save after finishing an exercise, to show that the app registered the tap. I learned the hard way after my workout that tapping save was not optional. Secondly, point out the above to the user because it isn't immediately obvious. Maybe that's common sense, but obviously some users will not think to do it. Good app overall."

By the way I'm not one of these people that were muscular before, in fact I'm quite weak. I'm very thin and I have nearly complete abs *3* days later. Will post an update soon.",

Theres nothing wrong with it they hardly ever have ads and i get to choose from 7 minutes to 8 minutes to elite with i think is 15 minutes but im not sure. Also the videos are really good. I got a different one at first but they were all flip frame and it really bumbed me out. So this is the one you want to get.",
            "Great app. Not as hard as 6 pack in 30 says but much faster and a bit higher heart rate. Great complement to other ab workouts if you're starting out pretty strong or a great way to get strong.",

I have to go manually pick my daily workouts instead of being able to pick a long program, which I would be more likely to stick to",

There is no pause, no proper asn slower instructions. It is like going after a speedy machine. Beginners this gonna loose your confidence. Worst app for us",
            "Great app. Had an excellent mix of workouts (groups of exercises) and individual exercises. The workout plans (groups of workouts on a schedule) are well put together. The videos and exercise descriptions are informative and helpful. The only improvement I could suggest is to be able to build your own workout plan. Excellent overall!",

For a high school student like me, I'm usually forgot to have a training time before using it, but it will also remind me that my training time was times up, so I don't have to worried about."

And I would suggest dividing the work out routine in 3 phases :warm up, customised work out, and the end would give it a more defined structure. Thank you",

We need to know the lenght of duration of next exercise while waiting. Number of laps should be fixed; I don't opt for an extra lap because we are naturally lazy"

            "I love this app so far. It gives a bunch of really good exercises and stitches. I already know that Ill be using it just about every day to build my body up and get stronger. Although, in the images for the app, the preview, you have an image showing diet plans and recipes. Although I cant find that in the app. If you removed that feature, maybe you should update the images so people dont be mislead into thinking there are recipes when there arent. Overall it is a great app.",
            "The app has workouts that may seem a little ridiculous(in my opinion), yes; but it gives you a timer, visuals on how to do the exercise(even videos if you have no clue) info on how you are doing, reminders, a wide variety of workouts for begginers, intermediate and advanced and most are from 5 to 10 minutes. You can find what you want according to your goals and even if youre busy they can fit in youre schedule.",
            "Great app for getting into fitness. However, once you have completed the 28 day program the only way to progress the program is by manually editing it. I would pay for an option for an automatic progression for another 28 days. It shouldnt be too hard adding a couple of seconds here ,making a bit of the exercises harder and such",
            "I fell in love with this app! Girls, its just awesome! They always have great exercises at the end of each workout so I always complete them till the end and feel proud of myself and satisfied! I do at least one workout every day and now Im trying to develop a habit, once I get this habit, I will increase the number of workouts a day <3"

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

Having to choose between the tiny phone screen and our tv (which is in high demand) isn't ideal 2) to be able to save check-ins on the app itself. The sharing tool doesn't always work and then I have to either fast forward through the workout to get my picture back (which messes up my count for my badges) or I lose out on the check in.",

Easily shareable, reminders to keep you accountable, and you can simply cast to your tv (If you have the corresponding device lol) It's awesome and motivating! I find myself always signing up for the new programs",
            "I was really disappointed that the programs are so cumbersome. You can't stream the workout on your computer which is how I normally follow workouts in that garage and I wasn't abe to cast them to my tv either. If you want to print material I would have to download on my phone email to myself to keep or print from my computer. I'm sorry I dont want to follow a workout on a phone"

            "Been using it for a little over a month or so. I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or \"extra features\" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",
            "Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!",
            "This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",
            "I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",
            "I like this app and I appreciate it. Just I have paid $2.99 for ads-removed from the app but the app still shows the ads and ask me to pay again for removing Ads!! I have already sent an email to the developer but I didn't get the response! I'm waiting for your reply as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and support. (UPDATE) I solved this issue by reinstalling the app. Thank you."

It looks like they don't even care about the things they put. I say this because I have some knowledge with bodybuilding. However, I feel sad to the people who don't have knowledge and follow their stupid workouts.",
            "I am looking for an app that alows me to define my own workout. This one was the best I could find so far, except that it has just a few number of exercises. There are many ones I do at the gym that are not in the app, which makes it useless for me. I hope they improve that soon.",
            "The app is awesome, from exercise description videos to the huge amount of available workouts, and there are lots of options to track your progress. I highly recommend using this app, and even buying the pro version to support the creators",
            "Ever since this new update the app keeps crashing and kicking me out. Or it freezes. I love the look of the new update but I can't use the app because it keeps crashing. I can't get to my gym workout programs either.",
            "Overall a good strait forward no bs app, each exercise has a explanation and a video and is pre-configured with workouts routines. For me it's good enough as I just go to the gym for casual workout , might not fit everybody"

            "It's great and I like the easy to use set up, I just started recently I'll update if I get any real progress ( like lose of weight higher than 10 PL ) and if I have any noticeable gain in muscle mass, good luck to u guys.",
            "This app is the worst! There is no heating up your body! Gets straight into workout and there are no stretch after working out! And cardio timing are the worst! There is no order at all! All workouts are the same time! If there is a 0 star! This app deserve it"

            "motivating, fun, exciting and immersive! I adore the detailed audio when incoming zombies or distant gunfire sound as if they're truly getting closer with your pace. \"Letters\" will also be e-mailed to you as you journey through this story. The free version is worthwhile for those looking to enjoy this a couple times a week, since it takes a few days to unlock each episode. Whereas subscription is worth it when you're looking to progress almost daily like myself. I love it!",
            "My favorite running app but... I like it for the entertainment. While the app is much less glitchy for legacy users than before, the distance is way off. I can walk slowly and it will say that I have done a mile every 6 minutes, when I have walked maybe half a mile or less. However, I do love the incentive to run when I have the Zombie chases on, it gets me going and has helped to make much progress.",
            "I love Zombies! Run!! I started running from zombies with the Abel gang in 2018, and never stopped. I only got 2 episodes into Season 1 before I started my subscription, and it has been worth every penny! This is the ONLY app that I cannot think of one single critical comment about. The stories are interesting, the actors are extremely talented, and if the need to find out \"what happened next\" doesn't get you moving, nothing will. Thank you, Six to Start!",
            "I just love this app, it got me running outside for the first time and made me want to go just to hear the next episode! The storyline is great, the app is easy to use and when the zombies chase you, you can't help but sprint 🤣🤣 Wonderful concept and so glad I found it! The other areas of the app like the 5/10/20km running plans are valuable and building up my base is a fun twist too. I recommend this app to everyone, its honestly the greatest motivator!",
            "So I have tried this on 3 different phones and had the same issue. Audio works for about 10 mins and then app goes silent. Have tried with / without music, internal and external player...no luck. As for not looking at app once started...need to remove that statement. Also, no headset start stop. No doubt the OS will be blamed, so uninstalled cause probably no resolve."

Also, you cannot navigate back or forth during the rest period making it slow to get back on track if you touch the back button by accident. Some excercises don't really have instruction on how to do them, just some words how 'beneficial' they are. Would also help if one could pause the timer and go read the instructions.",

            "Also there needs to be a larger variety off food choices or meal plans. I'm sure you guys are working on that. I saw what was on my meal plan I was just thinking I can't get that many meals in one day. Even though it's just fat burning I'm doing. I want to build muscle. 4 or 5 meals a day would be overkill. To much. I just think there should be better meal choice and prep option. I don't know.",
            "Right. This was a great app. My fav. It was simple and i could just use any workout regardless of bugs. But now theres a lot of errors. 2 minutes between 30s excersise 😂. Theyve obviously not checked it before they updated the app. This needs to be fixed. The app needs to be re looked at and if possible reverted. I also paid for packages but after the update i had to re pay for them again. Which is ridiculous. The rest times are definitely wrong and out of place. Cant even skip em. Shame.

It's so incredibly customizable they have literally thought of everything. From customizable caloric intake, to weight loss goals, to every exercise and interval amount you could use, visual gifs of the exercises in question, 30 day programs, choose any type of equipment you have and how long/often you want to work out and it will create your plan. 5***",
            "The app has a great concept. I like how it has specific workouts for specific muscle groups. But the problems I encountered right at my first use is it suddenly glitches and exits on its own, saying that app isn't working. It also doesn't have the switch side part when the workout you are about to do needs to be done on both sides of your body, like the side plank. It would also be better if there could be instructions on how to do the workouts properly. It's good, but still need improvements.",

            "The best 👍💯🥰🥰😍😍😍😘😘lot of support from me. Actually I thought of dwonloading other game but your game has make me intelligent 😋 and it's interesting while I'm doing nothing but your game has a feeling that makes me happy because I answer and the game asked haha Btw the best is the multiplication stage ahh it's sad that now people doesn't have time to play like your game but other shooting games like PUBG but still this is the best game ever. And BTW Name's SIZZLE 13 years old 😁 ❤❤❤❤❤",
            "If I said thanks then this is not enough and it will never be enough. By all means, this app is remarkable and so useful. Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

            "App worked great for the first couple of months. Now it won't track my steps. And if it does, it says that NONE of them are convertible. I've also had a lot of issues with steps being converted to sweat coins (it will track that I've walked 12,000 steps but only convert 100). I sent a request for help and never got a reply. Read one of the responses to a review and you guys tell people to submit tickets but you have an automated message respond saying that they pretty much never check it. Wth.",
            "Love this app, its not easy to build sweatcoins but if you save them you can earn some pretty cool stuff. I walk a ton for work so its generally easy to accumulate them. The offers update every few days so it always feels fresh. They also have awesome humanitarian causes you can donate your coins to. I would rate this app 10/5 if I could. Its engaging yet not overwhelming, one of my favorites i constantly recommend the app to my friends and coworkers",
            "Please fix my account. I have exactly 938,814 steps that keep adding up and wont caluculate to the sweatcoins. I have the right setting and everthing and no battery saver or anything. Im not sure if there is a problem with the app or if they are just scamming me when my coins actuly start to add up after 2 years.(update) i uninstalled and reinstalled and its counting again but i lost the 938,814 steps that never got calculated. Is there a way you could put these back onto my account.",
            "Whenever I use this app or hit 2× boost it starts counting steps then it will stop like every 10 to 15 sec for at least 20 sec at a time , the timer is stil going but not counting the steps . I am 67 yrs old and was so excited about this app . Some days its so hard to get started excercising but I make myself so I can stay fit. Please fix this !!!",
            "I've been a loyal sweatcoin user for over 2 years with no issues until recently. The app will continuously stop tracking my steps for no reason. I've re-installed multiple times and it never seems to work. Some days it decides to track my steps though. It's inconsistent, I already contacted support through the app and they didn't do anything to help or seem to care. I do over 15,000 steps per day and I've been subscribing to their 30 coin/month and it's basically been a complete waste."

            "Great exercises. I started using this suite of apps just a couple weeks ago, so I have yet to SEE results. I do, however, FEEL the results! I really appreciate the difficulty rating at the end of a session. Instead of guessing what level I should be attempting, I try a routine, rate it at the end, and enjoy a more tailored session next time. That is great! I would give it 5 stars, but the app does not connect to Fit regularly. Usually, only the first session in a day is recorded."

Cons: I don't like the fact that it regularly crashes, the calendar doesn't keep up with my progress, even when I go through the exercises in the time allotted for the difficulty level and the reminder feature doesn't work. I might just find a better app that is more interactive and updates in real time.",
            "Absolutely love it would totally recommend it, It's a great app for beginners then it goes on to medium And then hard. you get to choose What's good for you and when you're ready to move on or not. It's given me so much more energy working out. I never thought I was gonna find an app that I really liked. I'm just so thankful that I did and that I started it. and with it helping you keep track helps you even more to wanna keep going and moving forward and doing better and better so yeah I would definitely recommend it. 👍",
            "I've tried lots of workout apps before and they are all usually very hard to navigate and I can never see myself wanting to stick to anything that they are having me do. But with this one I like that at the end of your first workout it lets you take a quiz to describe your current body type and what you're trying to achive amd it gives you a video that makes it alot more encouraging to stick to this plan."

            "I am using this app for a long time... I think 1+ year, I love this app, it's really great, whenever I see that my belly fat is increasing I take that challenge, I wanted to give 5 star but there is one improvement I expect from the programming guys, if you can please also add the breathing schedule with the excercises. Sometime it's confusing like should we inhale while stretching or while releasing.... otherwise it's a fantastic app... Thank you.",
            "Helping to target abdominals. Along with mindfulness of eating as well as fasting. May not see results right away but definitely feel the results. And the look will soon to follow with endurance, dedication and discipline.",
            "Very simple and easy to follow. In the beginning I thought the exercises weren't strenuous enough but after the 2nd day I started feeling the impact. The settings too can help you customize the app to your preference. One amazing thing is it can be used offline and to me that's a plus. Kudos to the team",
            "It's a good app I used it and it worked the only reason why its 4 stars because the counting like when doing an exercise is to fast",
            "I usually don't give out one stars the lowest stars I give is like 3stars or more ! So this must mean something is BAD. Firstly I can't even see what the damn avatar is doing secondly The avatar is slow so I copy the avatar but then the timing gets fast so you don't know if what you're doing is right or wrong ....I can see potential I know you can make this right SO MAKE IT RIGHT and once you do I'll try the app again then I'll review it again....Thank you"

            "Sooo..the moves are good to incorporate in structured circuits but the # of reps would take the avg person w/ zero to low fitness about 3 hrs or more with potential injury afterward. Meal plan is..needs work. It's free and cheap but come on, not including healthy fats neglects reproductive health, brain power & fat is needed to burn fat. Some are 'fat burning' foods but is imbalanced w/out the actual fat. Oatmeal is not a thing to have everyday. This diet requires many tears at night."
