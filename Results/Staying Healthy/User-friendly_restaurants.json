You need a type in field for written customizations, temp for burgers, being able to add a sauce like cheese whiz for a side with a burger for the fries not everyone wants them fully loaded on top especially with pickup where they get soggy, and the options for combo items like plain chicken fingers for munchie mania instead of Buffalo. Just a few suggestions but it is improving just can't use it with my picky family.",

            "This review is based solely on using the restaurant portion of the app. App is extremely laggy when searching in map mode or just crashes all together (using pixel 3 w/ Android 11). Half the places that pop up are not actually dog/pet friendly. A Google search and a phone call would be easier and save you the headache of showing up somewhere that doesn't allow animals. This app needs a ton of improvement. Until they fix these issues, this app doesn't save you any time finding pet friendly places",
            "Had problems using the app had to uninstall every time I used it I ended up having to call the number on the app to get anything I needed to get done concerning reservations.",
            "Easy to use and accurate search results. Every hotel they list does allow dogs, but not every hotel allows dogs in every room, which makes sense. The description of services and pet fees is accurate. We enjoyed using this app during a 3 week long road trip and it has proved priceless. Have not yet booked a stay through the app, as we are gun-shy of third-party booking services, but we will try it out on our next trip. Kudos to the BringFido developers!",
            "BringFido is a wonderful app. It allows me to see a wide variety of places that I can bring my pooch! Resturants, Hotels, Parks, etc. I highly reccomend this app to other dog owners.",
            "Great but could use some work. When searching for hotels you have to reset the filters every time you get done looking at a hotel and if your comparing places it can get really frustrating and annoying. Other then that the people are great and and the app is super helpful in finding a place that takes dogs especially large or multiple dogs."

However, this app serves as a MASSIVE upgrade from Google Maps, since it allows me to find dog runs, dog parks, and other dog friendly places much more easily, which I think is fantastic.",
            "Definitely an issue with lack of people on here - I live in a 9 million person metropolis, and have only 2 dogs within a 10 mile range of me. The low stars are for the app itself though; spammy, business rather than dog oriented, weird configurations, a lame ripoff of Facebook. I guess I see why not many people sign up.",

            "Original complaint: Completely unstable game. I crashed 6 times during the tutorial, swapped to a different system and redownloaded... crashing continued. The game itself looks really fun and in between the crashes was enjoyable, hence why the crashing is even more aggravating. I really WANT to play. EDIT 10/12/20: Asking your players to contact support via your in-game support functionality when they report that the game is crashing and inaccessible shows how unobservant (or simply automated) these responses are. I tried to submit an in-game support request, lo and behold... the game crashed again and won't send anything."

We are all different & \"one man's meat is another man's position.\" Any venue can have an, \"off day\" ditto waiter, receptionist, chiefs, etc. It's an 'over view' I seek, a feel for a place. NB: don't just read reviews of places - but also reviewers reviews! Be aware of 'planted' (paid) reviews & reviewers.",
            "Good with booking a hotel, bad for booking a flight on Tripadvisor. The reason being is that I look on a different booking site for flight prices, compared this to expedia and expedia is the best bet for booking a flight as their prices make sense to me. Step up your A-game in the case of booking a flight Tripadvisor please!",
            "The best app for finding your way around a new place. It has all the restaurants and is almost always reliable, and is very useful for finding other things like attractions too. I wish it would remember more things when you switched off the app (ie switching to WhatsApp and then back) as its a pain to have to find the page you were just on, but it's still really a great app.",
            "You ruined the app. It used to be my go to app for restaurants and hotels, now it can't even find a location less than 1km from me. Not only that, when I did pull it from the map (which is also wrong) it said it was closed. What a joke. Don't expect me to use this app anymore.",

            "Decent start, but there's no option to search by name or view on a map so not really very useful. There's also something really fishy about all these glowing 5-star reviews left within a short period of a week or two. It asked for permission to read files on my device the first time I opened it, which I denied. Proceed with caution!",
            "Great and simple app to find nearby vegan restaurants. Love the filtering and easy to use favorites. Clean design, no ads. Just great! 👍",
            "The best vegan restaurant finder app in my opinion. Appears to be a pretty new / fresh one. I’ve been searching for a decent app for finding nearby vegan food locations but never found a good one. Working on my diet and eating habits was one of the key points for living a healthier live. So this app is pretty essential to me because I can also attend to add new and edit locations and be part of a great community. You also have a lot of vegan related reviews. I’m also travelling a lot so it is important to me to always have access to the latest vegan restaurants and locations. It is completely Ad-free, intuitive and easy to use.",
            "Easy to use, many filtering options to narrow your searches; Also, it is easy to participate. I've added two places and this app is inspiring me to keep looking for more places in my little town, to share with others! Absolutely helpful, thank you for a wonderful app.",
            "This is actually really informative and useful. If you're not vegan, use it for when you have vegan friends over. If you are, use it to quickly find ideas of things you can eat that you don't just see on the shelf at the store."

It just takes forever. Also why are menu options missing. Also I cant customize individual items. For example an notes block where I can type in \"no onions\" ect. Not bad not good...",
            "Probably better to put a more accurate status for the track order function. I love that it actually follows the driver on the map but before that I have no idea what is going on other than my order is \"in the works\". Maybe have it correctly update status with, order received, order being made, order ready/waiting on driver, on the way. If the order is delayed I want to know why. Order is still being made? Order was incorrect and is being redone? Driver in traffic?",
            "Don't get me wrong, I line the app and itz easy to use. But here's my current issue. Used to, users could customize their orders to their liking, but now they don't. For example, if I order from Burger King and I ask for extra mayo and extra onions, I don't get the option to ask for it. Any reason why, other than the Covid thing? Can we get this option back pleeze?; Thank you!",
            "Still not fixed: \"Go to\" system is completely inaccurate, can't read full reviews if long, and can't easily find your own in the review section or in past orders. Order page kicks you out of app if you hit the back button and you STILL can't rate individual menu items or restaurant overall. Scrolling through restaurants you can't see where you've eaten or what you rated them. Can't sort by \"tastes good\" or \"on time,\" and these problems have been problems for years.

            "Anyone who does not give this 5 stars is too anal for their own good! Best FREE app you will ever find with SO many capabilities! so easy to use! I was taking orders in under 3 hours with this!! AMAZING job. I highly recommend adding any paid options to this app! so worth it. for those who do not know what these platforms run monthly should refrain from lame negative reviews about; \"too loud\" of notification! Cmon!! Miss the order... miss the $$! If I could give this higher stars: I would!",
            "The app is great and the WordPress plugin both work together seamlessly, however, the notification sound is obtrusive and obnoxious! I contacted the developer about plans to allow users to change the volume themselves and the answer was essentially \"no, connect to a speaker\" I don't understand why they can't add a volume management feature on the app. Judging by other reviews this would be a very welcome feature and would certainly boost my review to 5 stars, until then it will be 2 stars.",
            "The app is very intrusive. It has a loud clanging notification sound that CANNOT be turned off, even if you shut off ALL notifications. Infact it even rings when the phone is in silent mode. Just makes it unusable. Also its always trying to put wifi on or off irrespective of the wifi connection. Its a battery hog and is consistently the top user of the battery everyday, even more than the display, Nearly a 40% reduction in battery life. As it does so many underhand things had no option but to uninstall it"

            "Excellent app. However it is currently experiencing several bugs such as not being able to modify a booking properly, the app automatically add 2 hours to the newly selected time. I lost a promo code because I had to cancel and rebook to be able to effectively modify my booking. I'm deeply confused regarding this bug because it used to work perfectly.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Ok that you can book tables easily. However, you can only spend the loyalty points at ~7 average looking restaurants in central London. I'm in Devon, it's not very useful to me! Have the TripAdvisor app and it's just as easy to book tables through that.",
            "Easy to book tables, but to be honest we're all here for the great discounts. I love it!",
            "Awesome! DawnIaod (WHAFF) App for FREE MONEY. Absolutely, love it! Genius level game. I am nowlevel we.put one annozing thing about this game is that the rest team has got much betterweapons than the left team. I've been getting more feed back whatsoever regarding my game that freezes i out of mgames to play. I lost a lot of points because of this issued, and thereis absolutely nothing wrong with my internet connection.

The incentive to get out and eat is wonderful, we are going to need apps like these in the post COVID-19 age, if we ever get there.",

My only feedback is to keep the Seated Partner program (I don't see it in the beta test app). It encourages us to tell our friends and family about it, win-win situation.

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",

            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results! I hope everyone who screwed up the yelp app to make more money instead of being actually a useful app dies of a horrible disease!"

They say on here to contact them when stuck on a level, I did and they told me I needed to buy boosters. Also they ask for suggestions to make the game better. . Shove it up your..... delete",
            "This game started out great but now after playing for several months it constantly crashes!!! Really takes the fun out of playing, especially when it does it while I am in the middle or towards the end of a level!! Uninstalling it.",
            "Level 492 is seriously glitched. You're supposed to collect red and blue to fill up the bottles, but they dont fill up so it is bot possible to complete the level. Other than that, fun game. But this level needs to be looked at and fixed.",
            "I read the reviews but thought I'd try anyway. Unless you pay, ads are forced. The game coding makes it so you either play many times to pass a level or pay-to-play if you don't have enough boosters or coins. A lot of the gamer's responses state they are a small company and the ads help them. They also state that they are looking at making improvements in subsequent updates, yet at the time I installed this game, no improvements or changes were made - compared to the comments in the reviews.",
            "Love 3 match games..having the renovation was extra.. Made it to level 289.. It stop being fun when you take an upscale steak house and clutter the landscape with a childrens playground(waste of time).. The wedding venue space is to small for all the decorations added.. The match 3 is harder as u advance and is not that exciting..takes to long to get stars needed to do a task.."

I asked my friends and they told me it also occurs with them. I can't even order. Plus the attendance is the worse. I lost one account because I lost my old phone and the number was gone as well, then I couldn't recover it, I asked for help and the support never came. iFood never did that to me.",
            "I pay for the monthly pass... And I am pissed off because it won't connect. And yes I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I've turned my phone one and off.... I needed up using Doordash with no problems only it cost me more money because I don't have a pass there. I'd like my 10 bucks back at this point. Uber needs help and no matter who I email I never hear anything back.",
            "After half a year, the app didn't improve. Application is full of bugs. Even cannot register in the system. A Year ago it didn't accept my email address, half a year ago it did, but didn't show the keyboard for the first name/last name fields. Half a year later (oct 2020) still the same issue. Guys, how is it possible to create such a bad app? Shame",
            "Worst app. Doesn't even run properly. App tries to connect to server but can't. After half an hour finally connects and asks for address and looks for food and bang no response. Just the same screen with address option. Looks like it is searching for food in Mars that's why there is no food around me. And the same process repeat again and again.",
            "I can't get the app to open when on wifi. I have to take it off wifi on my android in order for it to work. Otherwise I get the same message \"try again\" and no matter how many times you click it , it won't open the app. I have a brand new S20 Ultra and it hasn't worked on my previous android wither."

            "This app is completely useless! Not only can you not buy anything through it they're too lazy to update their hours. You have to call to see if the store is open when the app says. The one store that I go to sometimes was supposed to be open until 11:00. I got there shortly after 9:00 and it was already closed even though the app still says that they're open until 11:00 weekdays and 12:00 on weekends.",
            "Like others, the few times I've been able to sign into the app, I expected some deals if some sort. I. An rarely get into the app...consistently get \"user not found\". When in a store an Arbys employee said sometimes you have to uninstall/reinstall the app to get it to work. Have done that a few times now. Was also told sometimes resetting the password helps... have done that as well. Can't get in at all now after trying all those things. Worthless app",
            "App is only good for menu item information. There is no option for mobile orders and no information on current promotions. There are no deals like all other apps. Basically if you want product info, great then its a 5 star app. If you want to use it for anything else its a zero. Followed the steps in the faq area to resolve the app issues with no results. Cleared cache, cleared data and even uinistalled / reinstalled and the app still works the same. Now time to remove for the last time.",
            "Completely pointless. Seriously just an app to view the menu. There are never any offers and you literally can't do anything else on it besides select your nearest Arby's... for no reason whatsoever. Seriously I've gotten promotional emails for coupons before but there's nothing in the app. SMH. I like Arby's but this is just stupid.",
            "The app does nothing but show a menu, poorly presented. You can't order and pay online, the two BASIC things necessary for it to be useful. Just about every other fast food app has this functionality. I did see a coupon where you need to show your phone to the cashier to redeem it; that earns it the 2nd star, a generous rating based on its competition."

GPS is locked out, you can't even put in your address to see if there are any locations close by(there's one about 10 minutes from my house) and it doesn't show up on the map at all. Pretty much useless unless you hand over personal data to a company(ChowHound) that I've never heard of. No thanks. A&W with another swing and a miss",
            "I can see why it got so low ratings! It only gives me the option to shop \"near me\" which lists it 357 mi away and it won't let me change it! Useless, uninstalling!",
            "This app is terrible. The location says the nearest a&w is 400 miles aways and I'm only about 5 miles away from an a&w. You can't enter a location because the address form doesn't work. VERY DISSATISFIED",
            "Horrible allowed for location ,but wouldn't let me add my address. App say there are only six locations in all of US , I know that there are at least two in my area . Fix your app"

            "I don't like spending money on games, but I do watch a lot of ads. This game can be easily played without spending money (you just have to be VERY patient and use some kind of strategy), but unfortunately in the new updated they have been replacing features that were free with the same features, but paid. I don't mind that they sell stuff, but removing the features that already exist to make people pay more is very greedy and rude. I hope they fix this but so far I am very disappointed.",
            "This use to be a very nice game. Honestly, I fell in love with the ease of everything which led me to feel fine about spending some real money on certain things. Why not, right? Well...this game has become a nightmare. They completely began to change everything around, without warning or hesitation, to basically charge players for anything and everything they can. Their customer service is terrible, and there customer care base is at a solid zero. I would seriously not suggest anyone play this",
            "This was my first review with 5 stars: This is the first game that i didnt feel bored at all. Now, i'm changing my rating to 1 star! The update was horrible. This game has become more and more expensive to play. I am vip 7 but im getting tired of playing. The devs seem to make it a money making game now. It's not fun anymore! They took minimize the gifts in the bunny game. Now they made it hard for everyone to play without spending!",
            "Don't download the game. I've been playing it almost from the beginning but this game is not worth anymore! If you don't spend you will not enjoy it at all. I am a VIP player and I never complained about any update,not even about almost every bug that came with a new update but this one is a big bul*s*it! They made the game not fun anymore,and if you are a nin-VIP is even worse. Again,choose any other game to play but not this one.",
            "It's OKAY. I've installed and reinstalled a few times, and this time I started from the beginning (my fault). It does try to make you pay to play A LOT. They've recentydone this thing where when you ask the customers what they want and you tap on that recipe it shows you the ingredients needed on the bottom left side of your screen. I prefer to make the recipe thru memory that way it's more challenging and fun! I love this game, but pls make it more fun and easier for the no-pay players to play!"

            "It's a good idea, but was entirely useless for me. I entered my location and allergen (just dairy) and it didn't seem to filter the results at all. Most of the results say nothing about the dairy allergen and some that I knew for sure had no dairy free options. If it worked it would also be nice to have menu links in the app.",
            "This app lasted about 5 minutes on my phone. I live in a large metro area, and there are only 5 restaurants listed in a 5 mile search. When doing a location-based (not zip code) search, restaurants show up all out of order, not by closest ones. I will just continue looking up each restaurant's allergy menus online. One way this could actually be effective is for only non-chain restaurants to be listed that don't have their information online.",
            "The app is great!! I only wish more info was available. When we are planning to go somewhere and there is no info because no one has rated the restaurant it would be great to have info based on other related stores or just general info about the restaurant policies and procedures relating to allergies easily available.",
            "This app is great, you can type in your or your child's allergies and the city and state. The options come up and what is great is it is not just a star rating system it also has the reviewers allergies and comments directly from them. And you know how the establishment handled those specific allergies! So great!",
            "I always have this app on hand when traveling to choose a place that others have eaten at safely. There aren't quite enough restaurant ratings yet (but there are a lot: there are more here than anywhere else), so please download this app and rate the restaurants your eat at: for my sake, if not for your own! :)"

If you only have 20 rubies now you have to buy more my grandchildren don't have enough allowance to spend on buying more rubies come on guys think about that because now they need an adult to spend a lot of money on a game.",
            "The statement \" We create levels different in complexity to make the game more interesting and exciting. All levels are tested manually and possible to pass. Boosters and other extra materials of the game you can get in daily gift or buy in store.\" is BS! Who is testing these games? The time levels especially the ice cream levels takes so many tries to beat. The time shouldn't start until the people order shows. The coins should be used for boosters or gems. Addictive but NOT WORTH IT!",
            "This started off very well. But then it was frustrating as the booster were impossible to get and the upgrades were way to expensive. I just wanted to play a game where you do not have to pay to get stuff. This is just not right.",
            "Levels are hard to pass without boosts or added time too soon...they want you to spend money ... just like most of these free cooking games. I enjoy the game and the graphics but I don't enjoy it enough to spend money on it.... time to find a new game again.",
            "This game is insane. I make the food and it wont let me click it to serve it to the customer. Im on level 250 or something. And this just started. Its very frustrating. Very disappointed because i enjoyed this game. Ige checked for updates and have even deleted and re downloaded the game. Still wont work properly."

I have tried a few other POS app., and this is the best that I see so far. 4. I hope that you could consider the suggestions provided above.",

Spent ages setting up my tables and entering my menu (dont get me started on why on earth you should have to download secondary apps to gain LAN codes for something that should be straightforward such as a a bluetooth printer connection). However my real gripe is after entering g the bills for 16 guests - who pay weekly, ALL table bills were cleared overnight; regardless of whether they had paid or not, the app decided in its Infinite wisdom to delete all my guests tabs.",

I do get the coins for it but that's not the point. I need food to last more than a frikin hour. And just like restaurant story I start food and come back and it's not actually started cooking yet. So aggravating especially when it comes to goals! If I haven't completed a goal its because of the ridiculousglitching!",

Please solve it ASAP.",

I had to send them a email. The swiping is extremely sensitive and anyone can accidentally hit a crate without meaning to. Please fix this because I've been a player of this game for about 9 years. If its not a money hungry company I hope they fix it. I sent them an email so they can give me my refund or ill have to dispute."

            "It had potential. However, it lagged a lot, and the screen froze quite a bit. Trying to exit the game landed me in a never ending loop that put me back into the cafe every single time. I couldn't zoom out, so being able to see anything was difficult. I had to uninstall. I hope you'll work on your game because it could have been good.",
            "I have been looking for a game with this concept for a while but there are too many glitches. The cooking time cannot possibly supply the ridiculous speed the customers are coming in and staying at their table for the meal. There's no tutorial or guide to choosing what and when to upgrade. Trying to upgrade equipment and furniture is not as smooth as I would like. Game has potential!",
            "Was enjoying it .. but theres a glitch it keeps coming up saying next level ...and I cant do anythink cos the message is in middle of screen ... also it keeps show advert for new cameos one after another ..as if its stuck on rewind ..so it wont let me play the game Also I dont understand what the car symbol is for .. I click it and it just shows me rooftops of buildings an a arrow pointing above my cafe ...not sure if its supposed 2 do anythink else ...lastly can u neighbours if so how",

That's make me loose the stars many times. Is it because the bigger kuota that is needed to download this game? Not like the first one. So it makes this game won't run smoothly for certain devices. Please fix this or turn back to the first version.",

Gonna have to delete my game, has come to a standstill,,,,,, Adverts help me through the game,,,,, now they have stopped? Just won't let me use them???!",
            "Hi. I really love the game. And your new update is really good and glad that you added more restaurants. However , whenever I play the game , after playing a few levels it starts hanging and the game stops and goes back to home screen. How can I solve that?",
            "Really love this easy to play game. You must multi task to beat challenging levels so need to be an experienced player which I am. Also only have ads by choice to help win levels.",

            "This really is a great app. Especially if you are visiting an unknown location. I would give this 5 stars except for one thing: you charge for premium for content that is largely gathered by your customers. I understand the need for the income, but see no compensation for the contributers. I would like to see something like 'free short-term premium for X reviews/additions'.",
            "Awesome app. Have been using for years, and they have the most expansive reviews in even off the main road areas. Have used in other countries and was really helpful in our first trip to Barcelona. Travel in states we have used for first time trips - Chicago, Nashville, Kingsport, road trips between cities, Portland, Oregon Coast, Oahu just as examples.",
            "must have for anyone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. I'm not thrilled with the new \"premium\" features, but I spoke to the developer and understand why he implemented them. and there are a couple ways around using them, if you're cash-strapped like me and don't eat out enough to need them.",
            "It has definitely been useful in some countries, but not in others. Really needs a lot more input from users to be as helpful as possible. Frequently I have to add new places as there are no reviews - and the app fights you tooth and nail when you try to add places. But we will get there! And I would still say it is a \"must have\" for a traveling celiac.",
            "Every useful feature is now behind a pay wall. Used to have several features I've paid for off and on over the years, now there is absolutely no point to the free version of the app. And the price isn't worth it for questionable crowd sourced information that might be detrimental to your health."

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

Try again.\" It also says that I have not been to any of these places even though I have clicked that I HAVE been to said places. The lists is kind of the whole reason I downloaded this app. It will only allow you to sign up using a Facebook or Google sign-in. If you don't have one of those, or don't want to use one, then tough luck! Probably uninstall..",
            "I can't upload photos of the places, successfully! The updates about the places are not reflected/ reflecting after giving enough time say more than 24 hours! And so, rated only 3 stars! Fixing the issue i might ready to give 5 rates, for this app!",
            "Love the app. However, it is missing one major component, which I think would be extremely useful and helpful... Adding \"pet friendly\" to the list of filters.",
            "The best tool for browsing bars, restaurants and other interesting POIs, my daily driver. If some place exists on this planet, you can bet it will be shown in Foursquare. Used to have a perfect integration with both Navigon and Sygic Truck navigations. Sadly, it has been removed from Sygic Truck lately, making my life much harder, as I depend on pois due to my job. Amazing app, 6 stars if possible!!!",
            "I have been using the app for more than 2 years. I wish the visuals were updated and screens became more intuitive. For example I cannot access my menu when browsing, I have to go back to the home screen. Also there is a bug if you want to upload a photo of a cafe. I have a feeling the app was never touched/improved since 2 years."

One of the recent game updates has really about ruined the game with the events we should be able to pick our own prizes instead of the 40,000 surprise box I don't like this an I feel like other players would agree. We're working for the rewards we should be able to pick what we want. I was looking forward to getting my Halloween tiles and now it's impossible please change the events back",

Thanks. #1 game ever!!!!",

I noticed u made change on the game with 40,000 box. I definitely do not like this, we should be able to pick out our own prizes. We're are doing the work and putting in money. Please change it back,or I will not play. It's cheating, that you're taking our choices away frm us. Still u hv not updated, pls change that",

And it's so fun to finally have found a good design/renovation game that isn't a match 3. I'd purchase a game like this for console if I could find it!",
            "I love the game but feel cheated when I don't get the cash that I've earned on the customers who've come through already(if you don't clear a level). And the closing time speeds up...but I know I've had enough customers come through there to clear that level. You only offer a diamond at a time when you watch an ad. You're keeping the coins and making it hard to get diamonds to where a person has to buy your diamonds to upgrade the game that ain't right.",
            "I love this game. Its addicted! But now i've been stuck at Cafe, i had to use my hats to complete the task that i've completed before. I can't move to other level bcoz it says i have to complete all task while i have no level left to play and gain new hat. What should i do? I dont want to lose my progress.",
            "I have played so many of these kind of games but for some reason I really enjoy this game . I like the kitchen and I enjoy the story line . The levels are however abit difficult and the cost of the stuff you have to buy is abit expensive so one has to complete a lengthy amount of levels just to get one item....but other than that I really do enjoy this game . Thank you Chantelle Fivaz",
            "Love the concept but too slow to progress. I do about 3 levels, earn my chef hats then am suddenly stuck on one. Unless you use your diamonds there are lots of levels you just cannot get passed. I have to wait for a few days to get enough to move on. It would get expensive if I was purchase these. Lost interest now so may look for another similar app."

            "Difficult to get my sandwich exactly right with the app. They don't always see the \"special instructions\" I put in. The selection of chips and cookies in the app is very limited compared to what is actually available in the store. None of my favorite flavors are there. I don't think I'll use it anymore for those reasons specifically. OBTW, I waste more time trying to use the saved favorites in the app than just ordering previous orders or making a completely new one.",
            "For the most part, it's a good app. Not the most user friendly, but not the worst. Gives a limited amount of characters for special notes, but no way to make those notes elsewhere, i.e. no way to tell them you want bacon well done when adding it to a sandwich or that you wish the sandwich to be heated, except in the notes. And the staff don't always pay attention to the notes",
            "Great when it works, but it's been messing up my saved favourites. First, it forgot my saved customizations. Then it submitted my ordered favourite wrap as nothing but meat, despite all the toppings on my list. When I reported it, they passed it to the restaurant to resolve, nevermind they made exactly what the subway app had incorrectly forwarded them. I no longer trust this app to get my order right, or expect them to help if there any problems.",
            "App is Disappointing! I loved it when I got text rewards... usually had a buy one get one free and all I had to do was click the link, hit redeem and show them the code at the register. NEVER had a problem. Now buy one get one is super rare and when it does come up the app wants you to order online and THEN it will tell you if the coupon is available at your location... good luck finding a subway that accepts the coupon! sigh. I used to eat subway once or twice a week. now its rare!",
            "No help with problems. Launch the app and get an error that there is a problem with my account and to contact support. Guess what, called a toll free number provided by the store and they do not support the app. Who supports it? Who can help me? When I click on contact support it takes me to complete a survey for the store. Pitiful. If anyone reads this that can help please contact me!"

            "UI has confusing layout. Political posturing on the front page but no 'check in' button to be seen. Cancels reservations over BS \"identity verification\" or something with two days of notice. I have verified ID in app and 6 stays, only thing that happened is my card blocked an attempted charge one time. I verified that card and nope, still denied. Support claims the host rejected my request, they are lying. I have two days to find something else and my car was just totaled. These dinks unreliable",
            "We have used Airbnb many times both for overnight stays and experiences. The site itself is ready to use and accurate. I appreciate the feature that shows what the total will be because sometimes cleaning fees are extreme and a person needs to know that before they commit. I also like when there is clarity about specific cancellation fees for each location.",
            "Today I am very pissed off. I booked a location through this app about a week ago and today I am trying to make another reservation and they are saying my account has been locked for security proposes. Every time I try to review my account to it sends me back to the same log in screen. There is no number to call and fix the problem and I can't get around the log in screen.",
            "I have been using Airbnb application for more than three years and the fact that it has the same bugs from time to time is unacceptable. The switch account button appears and disappears. Even when it \"decides\" to appear some of the times it does not \"remember\" the codes of the switched account. But to make it even better after I log in to the other account I see in the listings panel listings of the previous account I just logged out. If I had space I would write more. Totally unprofessional.",
            "I love the idea, and regularly use Airbnb, but I'm keen to jump ship for the first competitor who allows me to access the original posting for the booked trips within the app. I find it incredibly irksome to be forced to a computer for one of the most frequently desired actions that logically should be available in the app. I often need to revisit to confirm details from the pictures etc but you simply can't here. If it wasn't for communicating with hosts, I'd uninstall and do desktop only."

I won't use them again. ***As to the reply. Ask your local restaurant. 8 out of 10 will tell you bite squad increases the menu price.",

My order got canceled because I never received a notification from the app that I needed to respond to an email that was sent to confirm information. Didn't find out there had been an issue until we went to pick up our food at the restaurant and had to reorder everything and wait even longer because it had gotten canceled. There really needs to be in app notifications in regards to this.",

            "edit: Even after reaching out the issue is still present. Brand new Note20Ultra and the app sticks on the splash page. I have had this app installed for on multiple devices, tablets and phones, and it just doesn't start. The splash screen comes up but nothing else happens. The web app works though.",
            "We've ordered through Bite Squad numerous times. The app it easy and we love the tracking feature. We can see where the driver is, a picture of them, and prepare for their arrival. The food arrives warm. I get notifications of deals and delivery fee savings frequently. It's so convenient, we spend probably more money on \"eating out\" than we should! It's so worth it though."

            "Been my favorite \"go-to\" photo editing app. Wish there was the same features for videos. But I dont take many of those. So I don't mind keeping it strictly to photo edits. My only issue is the price. I feel for photo editing thats not as extreme or precise as something similar to photoshop; shouldn't cost more than photoshop. But thank you for providing with an app I do find enjoyment with!",
            "I have had this app for a couple of years now. Unfortunately have had to change phones which included switching back and forth from iPhone to Android. Even though I've already paid it now won't let me use features on my new phone unless I pay again which I was going to be a sucker and do but it tells me I have the wrong password. Google says I'm using the correct pw. So looking for an alternative app. Super annoyed. Over it.",
            "I love this app! Especially the part where when you do the smooth it doesn't turn you into looking like weird deformed baby! Like a lot of other places do! I often have to do some things on here and then go to PicsArt to do others but between two apps just amazing! that maybe we could have figured out how to do the things on this one that I can do over there but other than that I highly recommend this app!",
            "I really think that this app is unique and has so many features that you literally can play with your pictures for hours on end changing every little detail and having so much fun doing it!! I went the extra mile and paid for a whole year of premium and lemme tell you, when that year is up, I will be paying for another one!! My favorite feature is the skin tone adjustment. It's really amazing and makes your skin just glow beautifully!!",
            "I really enjoyed this app. Even paid for the subscription for the year. 2 stars because after about 2 months into my 12 months it told me I had to pay for premium features again. I tried emailing but no one got back to me and I still can't use premium features. Super disappointing."

            "Thanks for this application. But the application doesn't allow making changes or arranging in category list like rename or changes positions name in one category list from down to up or from up to down. And if you put icon for owner can buy things for his shop. With icon compared between how much bought and sale.. I think when you do this update your application will be better Thanks",
            "Love how it is set up, but personally would prefer a more direct cash register appearance. Love how I can adjust the sales price, asks for every customers name, phone #, address, & even email address. Would like it to be just a little bit more basic though. :)",
            "99 usd i think is too much, after testing this app i found it has too many bugs and is not worth a dime until fixed.. The POS allows only small icons which have to be low quality photos 128x128 the pos looks like a disaster..",
            "Good app but garments shop ka update hona chaye...",
            "One of the best (if not the best) POS app(s), thank you so much for this great effort, keep it up! There's only one issue but I can't stress on it. if the printed text could be in UTF-8, so I can print in Arabic. I tried and it printed garbage!"

When I try to do the tasks it tells me I need to restart to claim the update reward, but restarting doesn't do anything. I would definitely change the rating if this was fixed.",
            "I absolutely love this game but it needs a few changes.First y'all absolutely must get rid of the current decorating set-up where 2 of the 3 choices must be purchased with in game currency. It needs to either be where you use your earned stars for completing decorating tasks or you use in game currency not both.Also it's frustratingly difficult to earn coins&hints, plus the coins you do earn from game play go into a bank that once full must be bought with real money.",
            "A really great game, graffics are detailed, music is OK, game play is great fun, and the restaurant really takes shape as you progress, all in all a game worth returning to time after time.",
            "Great game but the only issue I have is that I can't see the dialogue to read what the characters are saying to each other....please fix",
            "It's really fun to play this game.. The reason I gave four star is bcuz even if the character (Alice) have to take rest, or just drink something, it take 1 star to do it, it's reasonable cuz the cross word is easy to play and we can gain many stars so that's not an issue. For me the real reason is that they talk a lot ( I mean the story line ) n it gets boring to read so I just skip it.. But it's really a fun game to play in free time."

            "Challenging and fast game. Highly recommend this game, if you're up for a challenge. You can earn coins and gems by just playing, no need to spend any money. You can earn enough to upgrade food and equipment, and boosters. You'll definitely need to use the boosters on some of the food trucks. There are some trucks that are very challenging, it's a good thing that there's an option to switch from hard to easy once it becomes stressful.",
            "Funniest cooking game on here, music fits in with the theme, great graphics, however, this game makes my phone extremely too hot, I try to reopen the app and it won't let me off, it's dang near impossible to exit out, and not to mention the customers are getting impatient because the game lags, I said it, lags. This game needs to be fixed, because it is like I said a great game, but the heat, the lagging and not being able to exit out is a huge problem, not to mention I have to restart my phone.",
            "I was looking for games with a Halloween theme and I've always enjoyed cooking games so I decided to try this out. Very pleasantly surprised! The graphics are good, the recipes are imaginative, and funny, and the game play is smooth. I haven't run into any glitches. So far completely free to play which is why I will buy something so I can support the game developers. I see they have another game with a Christmas cooking theme and I will probably check that one out too. Great Job GameiCreate!",
            "I really like this game but there is one bug that confuses me. On level 386, Cake Shop, there's one customer that will ask for a blank, one layered cake but after you make it, they won't take it and you'll end up failing the level. Other than that the game is amazing.",
            "I absoulutly love this game.I'm on the 5th truck.Only one thing is my complaint-after you get a few trucks in it gets almost impossible to keep up but it is fun to work on.It gives you a ton of diamonds the more you play so you don't have to buy them like other games."

            "It works fine. I just find it too busy to look at and find what I am looking for. Maybe the white arrows are too large compared to the numbers in the boxes. The green bars are so bold that they scream like neon- making me avoid looking at them. I prefer up/down arrows instead of the slider for tip options, but appreciated being able to lock it in settings. Nice to have the adds out of the way st the top. Don't avoid trying this app. It could be the best one for you. I just prefer a subtle look.",
            "This is a really good app it's very easy to use and understand. There's just one thing that should be different on it. The sales tax is expressed in $dollar$ amounts. I think it should be expressed in %percentages% so it could calculate your State's sales tax for you. But other than that it's a really good app. I especially like the fact that you can turn on your phone's camera light and use it like a flashlight I have never seen that in any other tip calculators. Bravo to the Developers.",
            "The most versatile App of all I have tried! My congratulations for your effort in designing an almost perfect one. However, need to ask if you can design it for us to be able to set a Default tax, same as for the Tip. (Different states have diff taxes) Also there are times in which we would like to verfy how the merchant is computing it. Thanks! Eli.",

The website version of the site is just as bad it. When you add something to the cart it freezes and causes chrome to stop working so I have to close chrome and start the process once again. Its so bad its better off just ringing in my orders directly to restaurant. Very bad app!!",
            "Once you open, it lets you enter your favourite restaurant. I accidentally chose the default restaurant. Once you're in, the only restaurant you can view is the one you have preselected. No option to change or add new restaurant. Not flexible app. It gives you the option to select your favourite restaurant ONLY. Does not allow you to view others. So you will end up uninstalling the app and re-downloading it if you want to choose other restaurants. Hence, I will never, ever download it again.",
            "You need to do a whole lot more work on this app - it is very buggy - Restaurants disappearing, and just the way the CART works - make it one cart for all but prevent multiple restaurant orders at once (from a development perspective it should be relatively easy)",

            "Good concept. Had few places near me missing so ive submitted them. Also would be great to filter by fully halal only. Buts its good as a starting point. I normally have to use justeat or tripadvisor then filter for halal so this will be so much better once everyone starts using it and updating.",
            "It's pretty easy to order and get what you want. However it stops my music when I'm on here",
            "Missing some restaurants and no easy way of updating app to include those restaurants. However, this is the most comprehensive app I've found so far.",
            "Good application and the information is correct about Halal cafes and restaurants. One minor issue that information about addresses in countries like Russians and other previous states of Russian Federation (so called before USSR) are sometimes not very correct, but one call can solve the problem. In a nutshell, I would like to thank people who created Crave Halal since it very authentic. People keep the good working going on. I would recommend it with all 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. Thanks again!!!👍"

            "Happy again! I have really enjoyed this app and it has led me to restaurants that I wouldn't have gone to without it. (The discount makes the try less of a risk - or I might not have sought the place out.) I had an issue with their latest upgrade, reviewed and reported it. Crave got back to me, fixed the issue, and gave me a credit. I am back to loving this app! Thank you!",
            "Only used it once so far - second time should be today - but it's really great so far. I got to try out a new place without having to spend like $15 on a meal I wasn't sure I'd like. No issues redeeming my reservation. No payment info needed in the app. Just go there, order, pay some percentage less than full price (depending on the restaurant's offer), grab food and go. This app accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. A+.",
            "Granted I downloaded the app at night, the app did not have many restaurants with deals.  That's understandable, but there also was not a large selection of restaurants available even greyed out. This app could be interesting in the future once more restaurants are added to the platform or they showcase past deals at restaurants to keep you checking back for the next one.",
            "I used Crave for the first time yesterday and paid way less than the usual bill. Definitely useful and money saving. Highly recommend this app If you are tired of overpaying a bill. Thank you Crave!!! Excellent app!!",
            "Good app but there needs to be option to switch off and customize (in different ringtone/vibrate) notifications! Really annoyed by getting bunch of notifications from favorited restaurants throughout the day."

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

Regardless of the reason for this decision, it presents a very serious security risk. This app should be removed from the Google Play store until this is fixed.",
            "The app really became useless overnight when they released \"gold\" . I went back after months and it looks like they've done absolutely nothing whatsoever to adapt to the epidemic. There could have been tons of deals to get people to order during the virus but no, I log on to see $2 off an ultra dry looking sandwich and nothing else. Goodbye hooked. Thanks for helping me during the college days but you are a useless desecrated husk of what you used to be",
            "The app used to be good but new update sucks. Used to have a barcode or QR code but now is just a screen that says \"take $1.50 off\" and I show it to cashier and they just stare at me like I'm joking. If not that then they say they no longer use the app yet it's still being advertised in their location. Thought it was an off chance or bad luck but has happened several times. They also changed the count down tumer from like 5 or 10 minutes down to 1 minute and a half, too short !",
            "When I eat out a lot of times will check hooked before choosing. It's been a long time since I have used hooked but this survey is a great reminder it is hear for me. Ex",
            "The app used to be great for deals, now unless you pay for gold status, there aren't very many deals you can use. The app was great a few years ago when i downloaded it and now it's turned into a money hungry app. You shouldnt have to pay money for a money saving app."

Original Review: Used to work great, but lately it has all kinds of bugs whether it suddenly decides it won't accept my payment method anymore or errors out when I try to place an order. It freezes and often forgets to clear my order bag after I've successfully picked up an order. So many headaches lately, I don't know what went wrong. Ued to love this app.",
            "Constantly buggy and glitches. I've used it successfully but it typically requires constantly uninstalling and reinstalling the app or religiously clearing your cache. The deals screen often says you've already used a deal and have to wait an hour even when you haven't ordered in weeks. Overall, a frustrating experience for something that should be a convenience.",
            "Updated 10/2020: I've done everything including uninstalling and re installing. The app doesn't work at all. love this app when it actually works. More than half of the time, I can't pull anything up on it, or it is frozen and nothing on it will work. \"Connectivity issues\" is what it stated. Those issues are not with my phone, because i have service and wifi. Please fix!!!! It's pretty hard to use the app while there when I can't even get in to it.",
            "Fantastic app, works every time. Orders being automatically submitted and requiring \"reopening\" every time I switch apps is annoying but no big deal. One of the best developed fast food pre-order apps. The restaurants, maybe 1.5 star. They must be hiring illiterates, or they glance at the screen and throw in guesses for anything forgotten. The \"hot&spicy\" chicken patty isn't very spicy going down but DON'T LET IT BACK UP. Seems it turns into the fire of hades in your guts. Omg I cried, no joke.",
            "Well, a couple years later, new phone, different Android version, still freezing on the opening screen. so unreliable (CLEARING CACHE DOES NOTHING!) - your food isn't that great that your app should be so problematic. Business 101 - don't make it difficult for people to do business with you. BK works great EVERY time - BYE!"

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",

Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

So you can book your room and your flight from one great app, knowing you&#39;ll get the lowest price on both and 24/7 customer support.<br><br>Other recent improvements include:<br>- Send messages to a property when you have a question<br>- Easily recognize homes &amp; apartments in search (pink stars)<br>- Host mode for Agoda Homes hosts<br><br>Explore, travel safely, and keep in touch!",

            "Great app for the person whom frequents hotels (whether because you want to or have to). Although I am a diamond rewards member with Wyndham, I check into this app every now and then to see if I can save a few bucks here and there. The last time I did, I ended up at a weird, unfortunate spot, but will be reviewing that place on Agoda shortly. Great app...very effective and a time saver in the end. GOOD JOB!",
            "Great prices and easy to use. You people really have to read the Terms of Use before booking. If your room won't be like you expected, that's because the hotel itself didn't update the pictures. Agoda has nothing to do with that and many other things, such the price breakdown, which clearly states if the hotel tax and services are included or not! Your negligence. But I wonder why the \"pay later through Agoda\" feature, is sometimes so much cheaper compared to the \"pay at the property\" one.",
            "Super easy and always providing great deals. I started using Agoda several years ago when living abroad and found that it offers very competitive deals right here at home too. The interface is intuitive, easy to navigate, and filters are available to help find the right place to stay (I've only ever used for hotels). Customer service has helped me several times and have always gotten me good to go. It has become my benchmark for comparison.",
            "As a user of Agoda for almost 10 years now, it's just so bloody good. When in South East Asia, its unbeatable. And their booking system and how they keep improving the app, making it clear at every stage what your booking and when, is impressive.... Sounds obvious, but these guys have it well tuned. They don't rest on their numerous laurels! Swift cheap accommodation. You know exactly what you're getting. Keep up the great work (and amazing bargains), Agoda family 🙏🏽",
            "Worst app ever my husband book hotel room from this app, he didn't gt any confirmation or mail or msg. Money has gone from his account but app is not showing any booking or any confirmation, it's a fraud app, I want my money back, don't give us any room, give my money back and m going to sue u, going to file police complaints against you in IT cyber cell, I'm police officer. I will not give u a half star.🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"

The order is still in my cart, this is very misleading. After my 1st and 2nd orders I learnt about this, so it's fine for me, but to new users this is very annoying. Anyway, this app provide good service and I appreciate it.",
            "I have ordered many times via this app. It will work...IF YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK. Like today, I tried 7 or 8 times trying to PAY but I just couldn't pay. I am paying by credit card. I got to the screen and got the OTP and then I entered the OTP and then.... NOTHING. Waited for so long until the system tells me \"TIME OUT\". Seven or eight times trying. Giving up for today. Maybe try again tomorrow or maybe not at all. One more thing. If I somehow do receive the 8 orders, I will uninstall the app",
            "The app is good, but it needs more adjustments, like the \"add to cart\" button and the \"place order\" button. I think it would be better if both buttons is in different position, because what if that customer of yours has accidentally double clicking the \"add to cart\" button, simply it will directly to \"place order\" button. and it doesn't have cancellation of order, you must add \"cancel\" button. And it would be nice if you add this app \"checking order\" before the order place it. Please notice.",
            "This app definitely need to improve. I am regular user. The rider and food list all has no bad experience. HOWEVER! I most frustrated is to find LIVE support help. When I need urgent help I cannot find anything. FAQ no answer. When click \"not answered\" it goes bacK HELP CENTER. It goes merry go round. I spent close to 1 hour and yet I cannot find. So I gave up. I have clicked on all available function. WHERE IS YOUR LIVE CHAT OR TEL CONTACTS!!!!",
            "Its great to order on cash on delivery but the ordering system needs more inproving and the gps as well. I constantly refresh just to see where my delivery guy is at. It's not a real time tracking monitor. And for ordering wanna get to see the pictures of the menu not just the words. Like i wanna see what i'm buying. But over all food panda is a good app."

            "It's fairly robust especially when you consider it's free. Nice looking interface and the beverage database is pretty deep. My only complaint is when entering inventory on my phone the app tends to crash frequently and may not have recorded the last few entries so I've been writing it down then entering it on my laptop. Once that's addressed I really can't imagine why you would use any other inventory that you have a monthly subscription for. Nice job guys!",
            "Wonderful user friendly interface. Only one problem, despite the online version works perfectly, on the app version every time we type in the search bar looking for an item the app crashes. Do you guys know what might be the issue? Edit: Fixed in less than 24h, these guys are great!",
            "Signed up online after a google search and man am I happy i did. the inventory keeping on this app is awesome. Several of my friends are now using this for their home bars, including a brewhouse in my buddies backyard. We're using the cutom description to keep track of dry ingredients.Legit give this a try. If you are having trouble signing up through the app, head to their website and sign up there. Zero issues for me doing it that way.",
            "Glad I found this app. It makes it so much easier to do my wine and liquor inventory. I tried other apps that required expensive subscriptions but they werent worth it. this app is free and I could do inventory much faster on my tablet than by hand writing things down."

        "comments": [
            "I like the graphics of the game. The zooming option helps alot too, so I don't have to use hint much often. But rather than having to do the same level and same place over and over, why not giving sub level at different places or mini games? Or make the place more clutter with objects. Doing the same place continuously make me memorise all the objects quickly and make the game super easy. Some objects keep appearing through the whole game too. I'd like to see more challenging game.",
            "I love this game. It makes you work but not so hard it isn't fun. Great visually and I even think the music is suitable.",
            "I gave it four stars for the Artwork. But i became easily bored having to play the same scene over and over; even when it seemed I was scoring high. Just cannot hold my attention. I also find the background music annoying. They should try the copyright free YouTube tunes that people use for their vlog videos. That kind of music is exciting for the brain and gets you moving quickly!",
            "Like I said in the comets I like the game but that's about it for this game. I say that because of the hints icon. It's always beeping and it's a little annoying if you were to ask me. But it's an okay game, I guess. The only problem I have with it is the beeping of the hints icon. Cause if the game thinks you're not quite sure where to look for a item it beeps and just! keeps on beeping. And I don't like that. But all and all it's a very good game I guess. Peace out!!!!!!",
            "I love Midva Hidden Objects games! They're the only ones I like to play because they don't have any extraneous other games that you must play to advance; they're pure hidden Objects."

I would like to have it working as before.",

I have to manually enable this app at least daily and overnight it automatically disables again. Very frustrating as I'd like to dedault to this app for browsing. Hope you can help, thanks.",

Pictures will only display a picture symbol, symbol or emojis will display a square 3. Always want to set as default (if i click a link, it will go to this browser instead my default browser) 4. This is rare, but my phone will stopped working if I run this app. Please fix this bug, really this is quite annoying (I'm using Redmi, uninstalled using ADB)",

        "recentChanges": "Our latest app update comes with an exciting new feature! Introducing voice directions* — a simple way for you to make all your delivery experiences even more seamless. <br><br>Now help your zomato valet reach your location faster by simply recording voice directions on the cart while placing your order. You can even record these instructions once and save it for all your future orders. <br><br>*Live in limited locations only. <br><br>Update your app and give it a spin!",
        "comments": [
            "Would have given 5 stars, bu for 1) Valet movement is not updated on real time basis in the app and this causes inconveniences. This is not an issue with any random valet for his connectivity issues. The problem persists for all orders. Valet doesn't move at all on the map at times. The issue persists even after latest update. 2) Even after the order is delivered, at the bottom of the main screen, it is displayed as Food is being prepared.",
            "Great app. Lots of filters for ease of use. New update for one star on 30/10/2020. Pathetic approach. I ordered the food. Restaurant was ready with food, but no rider was allocated for an hour. Finally when I contacted customer care, they said sorry and added a credit amount for their mistake. I paid for service, not to get the credit. Finally, the restaurant itself arranged their own driver and sent the food and was never sent by Zomato. Regret to be a Zomato Pro member.",
            "The new UI revamp is refreshing. The notifications and chats are handled well. The payment page fragment design can be improved. One can easily miss the promo section, if its not intentional. I would expect orders to be shown by default than favourites in the orders tab. The order tracking banner is well designed as well. Kudos to the designer.",
            "Unfortunately with the recent changes in benefits of using this app, i stopped using it and membership fees were paid for nothing. Will never use it again simply not worth it. This is what happens when you make people pay for certain benefits of using the app and choose to wipe it all out but reyai the paid by members money.",
            "When I started out new, it was an excellent app for food delivery. But now there are issues happening most of the time I want to order. The menu is not visible to me and it is showing that I can order. Half the time I want to order there is some kind of issue going on like not delivering to my location or switched off ordering but actually it is showing that I can order now. What the hell is wrong with Zomato?"

Extremely annoying! Already wrote customer service no luck!",
            "The only thing I wish is for the change language to be there for any page. Sometimes while you're navigating you want to search a specific plate name or even the resturant name in another language, you have to give up your current state and go back to the home page, the settings menu to change the language. Where a simple language choice button at the top would have sufficed",

            "Froad app. Please don't install. I am not able to login. Then i reset the password using forgot password option. Still it is saying password mismatch. I contacted the customer support and they said they can't do anything. I have billed 2000 rupees for nothing. I am not even able to use the app. The worst ever teams i have ever seen.",
            "Pathetic customer service, UX and UI. I used the chat option and 6 agents changed automatically in less than a minute. Every time I start typing and a new agent appeared. Credit card offers don't mention the minimum amount of spend required. When you type in CC Number, it shows discount will be applicable but I get charged full amount. It is like you getting cheated but can't do anything. Customer service can't do anything as in their interface it shows minimum amount spend requirement."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "So far, so good. Easy to use and secure. I've only just begun to use this, to be fair, so I've not found any problem yet. Nonetheless, my needs are simple, and I expect this app will perfectly fill my requirements. 😊 UPDATE: Because I really like this app I have it installed on two devices, and would love to know if it is possible to synchronise them. Can you please advise me on this? It's SO tedious entering the details twice! Thank you in anticipation 😊",
            "As an app it is nice. However if you don't buy pro version you can't export passwords in .csv format. Only .db format is available and there are no instructions from developer how to access the data (it's encrypted ofc). I tried everything that Google advised, still no success. Would like some instructions on data access in this .db file",
            "I don't understand how it works? What is it supposed to do? Does it automatically fill in the passwords or what? I do not see where it explains exactly how the program works... Now that Ihave had some time to familiarize myself with your app I can see that it is actually pretty functional. You need to compose a concise tutorial that explains how the app works for new users.",
            "I would give this a 5 star, however, the only additional feature that would make this nice (if already a feature I cannot figure it out) is to be able to have sub labels. Example: top label \"Medical\" then within that label have several other labels \"Mine\", \"Hers\", \"Kids\", etc... Kinda like a folder structure in Microsoft Windows. Right now, if I have a label named \"Medical\" then I have to put all in that one label which makes it unorganized.",
            "I just started using this app and it is awesome! and I only have to remember 1 pass to get access to all my passwords! and if you are the owner of the app and Reading this can you please make a face id option so it will recognise you face? Remember face id not Touch ID because I'm using a Chromebook not an android phone so pleeeeeeeeeeeeas face id and also please not in pro version because I am a kid and I don't have any money. Just one more thing even though I've already said this this app is awesome!"

            "Game play is cool, the drag & drop is a bit laggy at times and upgrades are way to expensive because you don't earn much. My real gripe is with the developers... I was overcharged on one of their Gem packages, I emailed them with my issue and it's been a very frustrating trying to get my refunded compensation!!! I still have yet to have my issue solved!!!!",
            "Reverse the upgrade, it's a total mess. There's no good way to earn grams anymore. The food truck that used to give up to 6gems every 4 hours has been removed, I need that truck back. Getting gems is not easy and the amount of gems required for upgrade is always too high. Also remove that cray cruse ship and replace it with the truck that gives gems. It takes too long to get gems. This is wickedness haba!!",
            "I really like this game except the most recent truck that i opened (ramen one) constantly crashes the game. Its so frustrating! Im not sure if im the only one but please fix it!. Id happily change my rating if that's fixed",
            "It's really a awesome and superb.... App...... Very exciting and hurrying... So many feelings.. I experienced.... Better to increase the levels of this game",
            "I still give this game ☆☆☆☆☆ but there's a glitch. I just went 2 play it & it totally shut down the sandwich & bakery restaurants. It's as if I've never played them b4. That means all of my HARD EARNED GEMS r down the drain. I don't wanna uninstall this game but..... talking about you squashed a few bugs....squash that one.😶"

            "Great game but there are a few bugs that need fixing. On the next restaurant where it shows the lock and stars needed makes it seem like at that set amount of stars it will unlock but that isn't the case you actually have to get to a certain level to unlock it. Also on the fast food(restaurant 3) upgrade section I was unable to scroll and reach the last row. Once these issues are resolved it will be a 5 star game for sure.",
            "I really enjoyed the game, couple glitches where the game. Froze up but i just clised out and restarted and all was fine. I'm giving 3* because the game says there are over 1000 levels to play, but i can't get passed level 60. I have completed all 60 levels with the maximum 3* on each level, but the next island is still locked. There are no instructions and the help button says coming soon.",

It was created to perform as an actual gluten-free dishes collection from restaurants, where all the dishes are uploaded by us - Celiacs!\r\n\r\nSuffering from Celiac disease? Living on a gluten free diet? Here's your solution for eating out! \r\nCeliHack is the best gluten free restaurant guide that is 100% based on actual recommendations! \r\nWhat does this mean? \r\n\r\n- If you enjoyed a delicious and safe gluten-free meal at a Celiac-friendly restaurant - upload your recommendation and let other people know!\r\n\r\n- Had a meal that was supposed to be gluten free but suffered from Celiac side effects afterwards? Warn other people!\r\n\r\n- Want to have a gluten free breakfast, lunch or dinner at a restaurant and you don't know which you can really trust? With CeliHack you can find out where Celiacs near you ate and marked as safe! \r\n\r\nAre you a Celiac too? Download the app and help us build the world's biggest gluten free dishes collection! \r\n\r\nMain advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Presenting not just a list of restaurants which claim to serve gluten-free dishes, but actually showing those dishes, photographed and uploaded by other Celiacs who ate the dishes and shared how they felt after doing so!\r\n\r\n2. Based on the wisdom of the crowd: each user can comment on others’ recommendations. So, if someone uploaded a dish that you already ate and had a different experience with it (for better or worse), you can add your review to the existing “dish card” and notify others about your experience too. \r\n\r\n3. The app may change the way restaurants handle our food… maybe they don’t even know their GF dishes are not actually GF.\r\n\r\n4. Since the database should be built by us - Celiacs - it’s worldwide and can help us anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to start making a difference, we need volunteers to start uploading gluten-free dishes in their location. Since the app is new, it pretty much has no dishes in it, so you’ll probably see this empty screen when first opening it, asking you to start contributing content… We hope you will!\r\n\r\nThe app is free and will ALWAYS be free to Celiacs!\r\n\r\nIf we all cooperate and share our recommendations - we’ll bring traffic to the restaurants which take care of us, and it may convince the ones who don’t to start doing so too!\r\n\r\nPlease help us by uploading dishes to the app. A strong worldwide community will help us all by raising awareness! \r\n\r\nHow can you give back to the community?\r\n\r\n- Opened the app in a place where no one has uploaded a dish before? Be the first to upload a dish there and help future visitors! \r\n- Got sick from eating, but not sure it is from gluten? Report it (anonymously) anyway; if the restaurant is good, others will balance it out in the future with their reviews.\r\n- Came across inappropriate content (e.g. photo or text) in the app? Report the dish.\r\n- Most importantly, keep sharing gluten free dishes you ate out and tell other Celiacs how you felt after the meal. \r\n\r\nCelihack Features include:\r\n\r\n- Swipe through real recommendations of meals and choose if you like it or don’t like it\r\n- Add meals to ‘My Favorites’ and save for when you get hungry and want to eat at a safe Celiac friendly restaurant\r\n- Upload your own recommendations or rejections after eating a gluten free meal\r\n- Find Celiac friendly restaurants near you\r\n\r\nWith CaliHack you can easily find gluten friendly restaurants around you!

            "This is an awesome game but the gems are hard to get. It's not fair that it's only 2 gems/diamonds we are entitled to after each level. It gets very hard because you also have to upgrade with the gems/diamonds and it gets annoying that one cannot move from one level to the other because of an upgrade Nevertheless I still love the game and I hope that you increase the number of gems we get in each level to at least \"15 per level\" so that one can upgrade the equipment and buy a restaurant Thanks",
            "So what is very disappointing about this game is that you cannot go to the next level without buying gems because it costs a ridiculous amount to go to the next restaurant, I feel after completing all levels in one area you should automatically advance to the next one, good game but uninstalling because of this",
            "Good but I have questions. How do you make gems without buying stuff. It seems a lot of them and its a good game but how do I continue to next cafes? Having the ad after every round is silly too. This will just agitate people. I dont think I will play on much because Im running out of levels and getting sick of the ads.",
            "Nice but needs too many diamonds for opening next level. Shd just open free for the number of stars reached.",
            "I am saying if you have not yet played this game you are missing 😔 alot of fun but there is one problem if you are on the first stage and you press the bonus 🎁 you will stop getting free diamonds just like when you repeat a level for over and over again you will get diamonds but if you get press you will have to only play a level you have never but if not that 💯 sure it is great"

I downloaded the maps before leaving home, but here we are, on the road, and the app is stuck on Building Route, unless it errors with something like Unsupported Map Type. I had to enable the hotspot on my phone to get it to load. As a work around, I took screen shots of the turn by turn directions to get us where we are going. I'll be looking for an app that does what it says.",
            "Update: The last update did not help , it still crashes and or it says GPS cannot be found. I have sent in crash reports numerous times, no response. DO NOT PURCHASE!!! This app has the potential to be a good app, but it crashes, all the time! Even had it crash in the middle of heavy traffic and to make matters worse our turn was a mile out. Like I said it has potential but not until the bugs are worked out, as it is now, not worth the paid subscription for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus.",
            "Update 10/6/2020, today the latest update came out. Crashes should be fixed now. To make this short, it works for me. It's not crashing anymore. The app works better now on all three Android versions I use. 9, 10 and 11. If it still crashes for you, try what I did. Wipe cache and data, before starting the app, turn on all permissions right from the app settings. For me the app has been stable. Initially the app was not able to get a location. Shutting down the app and starting it up again, solved that problem too. This is a great app. If you have issues, email the developer. The address is below in a response to my initial complaint. He will try to do his best to make it work. For my part, I will try out all the other perks that come with this app and a subscription. I still feel I should get some credit for the last couple of months that this app wasn't working. :-)",
            "Signed up for trial on Oct. 23, on the 7th day I canceled subscription but was charged anyway. I don't want it. Was charged at 8 AM was notified by Google after that to allow me to cancel but when I canceled it says your subscription has been cancel as of Oct 30 2021. I want a refund now I complied with the 7 day cancelation requirement.",
            "Not ready for general use. RV Trip Wizard integration in the app does not work. Only way to use the RV Trip Wizard is to access that directlyvia the website. That integration is this app is critical to use the integrated GPS app. RV Trip Wizard is great but this app is not usefulat all. Someone didnt test this app. Not recommend"

            "It's basically just a coupon app w/o any great savings and more work. I got the 20$ credit from Tmobile. Every restaurant it showed me for my area had way better deals through their own sites or another party (ex. groupon). Overall, I've never \"saved\" 20$ that I'm estimated with the credit. At most it's 10$ because the offers are too limited, sometimes are not accepted or understood by vendors, and they over estimate savings a lot of the time (they est. 7$ but I saved $3). Not worth it.",
            "All comments here have valid concerns. All replies to said comments are either \"You can't read\" or \"We're sorry, but it's your fault not ours\". Not to mention is nearly 2021 and comments dating back to 2019 are asking for a simple name change to the icon. I could do it in 5 minutes, why's it taking you guys nearly two years? This app is terrible too. I used the original, but now it's just a pain to use. With a 2.8 rating you'd think these people could grab a hint. Talk about blind and useless.",
            "Terrible app, tells you estimated savings which are completely incorrect. I got the $20 credit from TMobile and got one coupon for one Smoothie King location which they didn't even accept. Also from seeing the other reviews they blame the users instead of fixing their problems or say sorry the app isn't up to our taste when we try to give helpful feedback. Better to just use RetailMeNot or Honey instead of this.",
            "Hello, to whom it may concern I would like to say this app needs to be updated because its confusing the way it's now and not very welcoming app, so someone need to update with a better way to save money when using it. Also the codes aren't working, it should be change to some kind of bar scanner.",
            "Downloaded app but after reading the amount of horrible experiences and the lack of attention to address the issues and correct them by the developer I'm dissapointed. Better safe then sorry. Focus on your customer service and improve the user experience. You'll retain your customers. Unfortunately, by the looks of things, youre to deep to redeem yourselves."

            "This is a fantastic little app. It's immensely helpful, especially when you are traveling or somehow away from your base/neighbourhood. It gives you ratings for the *specific food* you wish to eat, not the restaurants serving it; so you no longer have to rely on the rating of the restaurant serving the food (and be disappointed in the end) because you can now make your choice by the metric that actually matters. What's more, it also shows you on map how far each option is away from you and even navigates you to your choice without leaving the app. A huge time-saver. Highly recommended!",
            "I really love and recommend this wonderful application because I am a student who live in the hostel always wondering what to eat for the next meal, it helps me sorted the restaurant nearby based on the food price and food rating. It really save a lot of cost and time and even provides a guide for me to have my meal with cheaper price but in a good taste. Really appreciate this app and thank you😉",
            "The only app to compare restaurant foods according to food price, food specific rating and distance. App also navigates you to the selected food via car, on foot and transit options with embedded navigation inside the app. While Yelp, Zomato and other restaurant comparison apps provide reviews and ratings and comparison in restaurant level, AwayTake is the only app to provide comparison in food item level. Inside navigation removes need to open other app to navigate to the food. You just write Burger, Pizza, Burrito, Taco etc , specify your location and app lists all food items related to your search query according to price, distance and food specific rating. Just click on the navigation button select one of the car, on foot, bike and transit options and app takes you to your ideal food. Definitely a ground breaking app in restaurant and food&beverage Industry.",
            "Great nice app. It's compares the prices and shows us the best deals. Even other leading food delivery platform fails in this feature. Nice interface and good features. I m a foodie and I love to use this app on daily basis. Keep rocking team.",
            "Great app with lovely features on how to compare food food price and show good location of a restaurant.It is easy to be used. It has really helped me a lot. I do like this awesome app. A responsibility of thankfulness is all together for developing this app"

Nobody's sharing my information! Tell your friends take control of your life!!",
            "I've been using this for quite awhile now & have made it my default browser. I love the privacy aspect- especially now that we're in the middle of the election. I don't get the SPAM emails that I do if I use the typical Android browsers. DDG has all of the functionality that other browsers do but the best one is being able to delete my browsing data without a trace, & it auto blocks cookies( which media & shopping sites don't like, but I think it's great.) It's also very user friendly.",
            "I've been using this browser for 1 1/2 years with no problems until 2 weeks ago. When I tried to login to a site I use regularly I got a message saying it doesn't support Safari 4 and I keep getting this message since then. I could use chrome, but I don't want to. I sent 2 emails to the developers last week. They haven't replied. Disappointing! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Didn't solve the problem. If I had gotten a reply from technical support I would have rated it a 5.",
            "All it really needs is a built in ad blocker and it would be the best private browser you'll ever really find. Its speed makes it an amazing \"default\" browser for quick use, and the ability for it to automatically erase your data after a period of inactivity is priceless! But until it can block ads, I still have to primarily use other browsers for YouTube and leisure browsing. Without that important function (which is a basic standard today), it still falls under a very niche browser.",
            "Wowser Browser! DDG allows me options that none of the others do. For example, it allows copy & paste a host of things with ease much like Chrome without the peeking over your shoulder cookie monsters. It isn't such a hassle to save your favorite/ most visited sites. Sounds simple enough. But to my frustration with the exception of a few browsers, you have to literally manually save a site that you just want the browser to open up to automatically. I love DDG!"

Factor in your working hours and some of us can plan ahead. Then it'll be perfect. Edit: by working hours I mean the working hours of the individual restaurants. It would be great if we knew when they close and open",
            "Nice app ,very helpful the design is just boring and doesn't look modern but overall very nice app",
            "good app really knows the requirements from menus notifying when order is taken which reataurants are open in addition saves your data if you really liked the dish keep it up guys i would request a mini map system to know how far the food is and the time it will take for the food to arrive",
            "80% of the time your reviews for restaurants can't be submitted because of some technical application problem, so you can never express how bad that last meal was sometimes. Most restaurant menus lack pictures or in some cases, actual pictures.. but I dont know if that's related to the restaurant themselves or the application management. Other than that, great app."

And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side.

It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems, such as diabetes.

            "Been using it for a little over a month or so. I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or \"extra features\" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",
            "Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!",
            "This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",
            "I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",
            "I like this app and I appreciate it. Just I have paid $2.99 for ads-removed from the app but the app still shows the ads and ask me to pay again for removing Ads!! I have already sent an email to the developer but I didn't get the response! I'm waiting for your reply as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and support. (UPDATE) I solved this issue by reinstalling the app. Thank you."

Perhaps an improvement on when you're asked to check if you are human will respond to your captcha direct will make it better because often times when you click on continue it takes a different direction and you have to struggle to cancel it in order to get what you want you go back and do it carefully otherwise is prone to take you else where you never intended.",

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. 🙄",
            "After the latest updates seems they changed the format like where now you can't randomly choose a particular search area and for another instance you cannot unlike any of your ( likes) unless you're a paid member or unless only the person you had liked)pops up when you open the app,, then and only then you can choose to unlike the person or pay membership fee.."

All mid 40s never married, no kids and all from the next town over. When you ask questions they don't answer and change the subject.",
            "App is literally all bots. Every single profile is fake. Read the bios and you'll see what I mean. All responses make little to no sense, and if you try to take the conversation outside the app, every single woman refuses and thats just absurd. No shot 13 women are dead set on staying on the app only. Especially when they're reaching out to you first and sending you messages first. If they're that interested they wouldn't force you to stay on the app and buy more coins. Devs are scamming people.",

For an app that has been downloaded only 500k times, there are a suspicious amount of people in my medium - sized city using it (you seem to be region-locked). 2. Without exception, every single profile I liked looked at mine after about 5 minutes and liked me back after a couple more. They almost always express interest in talking to you immediately, but then never reply. 3. Crass as it sounds, there are no remotely unattractive people on this app.",

Don't trust the location of the so called members on the site! Once you pay your membership, you then have to keep purchasing tokens to continue your conversation. This site is definitely not worth it! And I am not an angry consumer, just providing an honest assessment! This site appears to have all bots! DON'T DO IT!!"

I got to the airport and had to buy new, separate tickets for every step of my journey. The refund section of the app does not work. The company have my money and have done nothing to refund me.",
            "App isn't working now, I think they've pulled the plug and ran away with all the refunds and fees collected. Google needs to ban the people behind this app and company and report them to the authorities. They operate their back office in Eastern Europe, might be another sign of scammers. I've lost hope getting a refund from them.",
            "Oct/2020: more problems with cancelled flights and rescheduling... alternatives were ridiculous, and it's impossible to reach support within acceptable time. Will not use Kiwi again. March/2020: My flight has 2 legs, both cancelled by the airlines, only one of them appear as canceled on my booking, I can't ask a full refund automatically, and was given 24h to request it... Refund is done in Kiwi credit, while companies are actually returning the money... I doubt that support will answer to me...",
            "Pretty useful for manage most of your booking, however, a couple of functions are not showing, so for example to tick off all the necessary acknowledgement boxes you'll still need to log in you account using a laptop or desktop.",
            "I have tried to use this app for the last week and it keeps telling me that \"you must be offline\" as this is the only app that's not working in my phone and I have also just done the update. Please get this fixed."

I typed it in right. It pretty frustrating when you need a ride and can't even access your lyft account for a ride. This has been going of for 2 years now.",
            "Up until tonight Ive loved the app, but as of tonight it charges me for the ride but after I go and order it it just goes back to the select destination screen it doesn't look for a car then it tells me I found a car and be ready in 18 minutes but there's no trace of it inside the app I don't know what's going on right now, I'm very disappointed and kind of stranded not because of this possibly unless this guy just shows up mysteriously in 18 minutes I have no clue if he's going to or not",
            "I have had an account for years but have not used it since 2015. I moved to a new state recently and had re-download lyft and tried to attach my payment methods. I tried to attach every option that is offered and the app wouldn't let me. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled several times. There's is no proper customer service set up. I finally found a number that would keep me on hold then eventually hang up. This is why I prefer uber, I never have these problems with them.",
            "Changed my address a week before downloading. My card didnt match my new address when adding it yet. Understandable. But now that my address is up to date, i still have to use a completely different card. I contacted support who told me my card wasnt working or they dont accept it _. I tried explaining it was my address, they sent me to a link that told me I need to use a new card. Its just very frustdrating. I gave it two stars because the drivers are always awesome and the prices are fair.",
            "Terrible. Added my credit card a day prior and thought it was set to go. Now I request a ride and they want a second credit card that has matching address, provided this unnecessary info and rejected because could not validate, your problem not mine. Dishonest, unreliable, do not use if your ride is a necessity. Unbelievable. 0 stars if I could"

            "This app seems to be littered with dozens, if not, hundreds of ads that have been up for, in some cases, over 2 years. I sent one a message asking if it was available, and didn't receive a reply. After seeing that the ad was still posted, I also noticed that it was posted 2 years ago. I saw a few other listings that had the same story. I liked how LetGo didn't leave listings over a couple months old without asking the lister if it was still relevant.",
            "This app is far less usable than Letgo was. The second I click on one thing to see what it is, I am immediately bombarded with listings of similar items from ebay. If I wanted to look on ebay, I would use that app. Don't assume I need to see 20 of that item. Prices aren't listed in the browse page so I have to click to find them. And when something sells, it doesn't disappear. It just stays with the other listings and says \"Sold\". I dont need to see all the things I cannot buy.",
            "Over 70% of the messages you will get will be fraudulent scams (they are quite obvious, but it's annoying to deal with). There is not much support for when you have issues with the app and I kept getting my posts removed for items being \"intangible\", which was not true, had photos and descriptions of actual items and there was nothing I could do about it, so it just became pointless and frustrating to use. Stick with FB marketplace or CL or other platforms",
            "Titles, descriptions, and prices of items are not shown in search results, leading me to click a bunch of images only to see that the item is not what I want or out of my price range. PLEASE add titles and prices to search results page. Also the gallery of pictures that are not in any order or in one grid make it confusing to look through listings. I don't get what the intent is... To have me looking through the app forever and never finding what I am looking to buy???? Please fix the UX.",
            "The app already sucked, but now it's worse. Why would you combine 2 apps and not take the good from the other app? To many old listings, nothing expires. Messaging is a joke, you're better off talking to the wall. An speaking of messages, how can I sell something if I dont get notified? To many times I've had to open the app just to see multiple messages, days old, and the buyer long gone, thanks offer up. I remember when this app came out, that was its prime, now it's just garbage."

            "While I have always backed up my photos on Google Drive, it's nice to have the Amazon Photos complete backup as a failsafe. However, Google's photo software is not usable, and Amazon Photos has a couple of features that are outstanding. The user can place selected photos into any number of albums. An album can be selected as your tv screen saver. More importantly, it can be sent in an email, allowing the receiver to view all the photos in the album, hundreds if desired, with a single email.",
            "I love how everything syncs to one place. Amazon photos puts different people in their own little album, so its really convenient if you are needing a picture of a certain someone all you have to do is go to their album and any picture you've ever taken and they are in it (even way in the background) it'll be in their. My boys looked identical as babies and we were so surprised amazon could recognize which one was who. Its also nice to have memories pop up from the same day 1-5years ago.",
            "Since my Kindle HDX DIED with years of photos I couldn't print on it., This Amazing Amazon Photos APP helped me reconnect with the Majority most of the photos that were backed up.. This APP actually helped me reconnect with some photos I hadn't seen in years, because I hadn't realized that my photos were being Backed up each time I plugged it in to recharge the battery. So grateful for that. THANKS AMAZON 🐸💖STILL accurate information. I can STILL can go back to pictures I took 5+ years ago. A",
            "I was invited by a friend to share pictures on this app. I thought what a cool idea. I HATE that this app copies all the pictures on my phone, and stores them. Now every picture i take goes to three apps: Gallery, Google Photos, and to Amazon Prime Photos! I also HATE that there is NO left navigational plane foe me to get into the trash can",
            "Amazon photos is not only easy, it is convenient, take a photo and it instantly comes up on my Echo Show, it's like having a moving picture frame!! Also can watch on the TV and my Amazon tablet besides the Echo Show. Paid for additional photo and video storage, compared to having them printed!!"

            "I booked services on this app twice. Both times the technician never showed up. Nor is there a way to follow up or get updates. This app is a waste of time. Uninstalled it.",
            "Highly unprofessional behaviour. I had booked from 4-5. The expert alotted calls up and say she is available after 5:30 or 6. She also said to cancel the booking and gave assurance that new expert would be alotted for the required slot. When I do that, the slots are shown booked. Why do they accept the requests if they are not available only. It was such a headache for me because I had to go somewhere in the evening and all other salons were fully booked for that day. Frst nd last experience.👎",
            "Used app for first time, horrible experience. Person didn't had understanding of work assigned. broke my new lock and make shift arrangements were done which broke within one month. on contacting housejoy, no help was provided.",
            "It is not giving an option of typing my address manually. The App detects my location correctly but the address that it generates based on my GPS is not correct.. It shows 3 houses far away house-no. I tried to edit the house-no with the floor-no but not able to do it as it is allowing to set my address only via GPS. Allow users to manually type their address as well because at times the manual entry is more accurate than GPS generated house address.",
            "Waste app.. While booking any serive they will show small amount and the techinican who visits your home will ask 4-5 times higher amount which is shown while booking... If you complain about that also there will not be any response from Housejoy.. For just saying there is a problem in AC stabiliser technician charged 900/- and after he lefts I got a message that the charges for the service is 143/- means he as taken 5 times high amount regarding which I have complained for more than 6 times."

            "App takes 'ghost' payments which take 3-5 days to return to your bank. Order \"failed\" there nights in a row, but the money left my account and will eventually be returned. The first time, customer service offered me a £5 voucher and promised me it was a \"glitch\" that won't happen again. When the same happened again they just stopped replying to messages and have ignored me since. The cost of 3 orders has not yet been returned to my bank.",
            "It's a simple, easy and cheaper takeaway app to use.....no hidden charges added on at the checkout like the famous main well known app everyone uses......its a cheaper platform for takeaways to use too.....admittedly it's not massively popular yet but once the takeaways who pay fortunes to the multimillion pound brands, open their eyes and see the benefits of this....then the choice for us the customer will naturally improve.",
            "Great app in general with one exception for me and that is Notifications. Especially for money off codes. They appear on my phone home screen as a notification and when I click on it, it takes me to the app but my notifications are empty and then the notification will appear 2 days after the code has expired. Very frustrating indeed. The latest notification was today for national curry day. I have no idea what the money off code is or when it is valid until. Poor.",
            "\"UPDATE: As promised, I said I would edit my review once the below issue had been rectified which has now been implemented!\" Love the discounts - keep em' coming! I've lowered my star rating because I've noticed that when trying to leave a below average review for any given restaurant it is suspiciously omitted? Once this issue has been rectified I will gladly rectify the star rating here. Ironically, Google play will allow me to leave this below average review because..that's how it should be!",
            "Great app, better deals than just eat, some different restaurants Update: I've reordered twice now and there's been no collection issue, so upping rating to 5 ⭐. However, there's one problem of the app not saving my past orders (not a big issue as I've favourited my restaurants)"

            "Does exactly what is promised. I've been using it for 6 months and it still works fine. It's intuitive and highly practical. There's a slight learning curve when sharing lists across different phone types (apple/android/Google) but that may have been just me and my partner. Nonetheless I still use this app every time I go grocery shopping. Highly recommend it.",
            "So far it keeps the items I need in order. Now if it could just stop me from impulse buying it would be perfect. I guess I'll have to work on my self discipline. ET I have checked the others and this is definitely 5 stars. I had to play with it just like any other app/program that's new to you. I love it!!!. Get it now. It has saved me from dragging my daytimer and list into the store with me. My smartphone is with me all the time so my list is always with me. ET",
            "So Helpful! We do shopping once and week, and without fail, we always forget something or my kids text me to pick something up AS I'M DRIVING HOME! We have now all downloaded this app and we add to it as we remember things we need. Since it syncs and updates automatically, my kids can add to the list even if I'm already at the store. The app is very user friendly too. I love using it.",
            "We have been using Listonic for a while now. This is our second time buying the upgraded version. I highly recommend it because you can share lists. My husband and I linked a list called Grocery list so that either one can add to the list, and even send a last minute item if one is already at the store. We also created a separate Christmas list for each member of the family. Throughout the year, everyone updates their lists as they see things they like. It has made Christmas so much easier.",
            "This app, is great. It let's me update my list and add anything to it when I think about it, because I usually always have my phone near me, while a list might be at home, and i might forget to put what ever I thought of on the list when I got home. I can also make multiple list for several different stores. I can also make lists for fast food places. It let's you see a list of items as you are entering items, so yo I can pick from the list. It learns you item you enter so it is easier next time"

Some of the restaurants that go through them ruin the good 5⭐ customer delivery experience with cold messy food that just cost $40-$90. Would invest in this company if I could!!! I already refer anyone I can to download the app and sign up. Their better than Uber eats, Favor, GrubHub. Recommend getting app permission for (Android/IOS) Maps for faster and more accurate tracking. I sent an email detailing some more information."

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

Stopped working and never resumed. Customer support takes days to figure out anything. Sent me the wrong message about Kaspersky kid troubleshooting. Stear clear from this service, especially if you are in China.",
            "The VPN always turns itself off. I find myself always checking to see if it's on. So many times I've noticed that it's off and I get to play the \"how long has my data been un secured\" game. Definitely won't be renewing my subscription as this app isn't trustworthy. Such a shame, as I've been using Kaspersky for years.",
            "I've been using this app for a while with no problems on my S9 Plus, recently I updated to the Note 20 and it's not working on the Note 20 but still working on the S9 Plus. It says it has connected to said location but I still cannot access blocked content from the country I am in using my Note 20. Please fix this problem.",
            "If you are paying for only getting this service on Android phones, don't waste your money. It only works on Windows and Android app is useless as it always fail to connect. For a whole year of subscription , it worked for few days on Android no matter what the device I use. They would reply that service is blocked in country while it works well on Windows all the time. Inexperienced support on mobile platform indeed.",
            "Edit: already fix it, thank you.. First the app was working good and then (don't know when) the app fail to connect, try to restart my device but failed, then try reinstall but failed connect my subscription account, please fix it. Note: my another device just fine using it,"

            "Too many ads. Literally before every level and after every level. Otherwise I imagine it would be a fun game, however I got to level 3 and gave up because of the adverts. Huge put off. Disappointed",
            "Well i agree with the others...way too many ads. they pop up when you finish a level and try to go to the next...they pop up before you even start a level...and you have to wait to close them. i would watch ads to get free gems but not like this game has them. and I'm only on the 4th level! trying to replay the levels to get the key and here come the ads. Btw i never download games from ads unless i choose to watch the ads. sad cause game seems nice but will delete.",
            "so far so good...just downloaded this game and im really enjoying it!!!! but just as everyone else has said/complained, there are TOO MANY ADS!!!!! Ive only completed the first 6 levels so far and have had 12-16 ads pop up already!!! 1 before the level starts and one after and one or 2 inbetween. yall really REALLY need to fix this!! id watch t.v if i wanted to watch just commercials!! come on guys, tighten it up!!",
            "Sorry. If I could have given this game a 1/2 star. I would have. WAY TO MANY ADS. One before each game is ridiculous. Players should be able to get through a level and then ads. Or at least give coins or diamonds for watching an every \"mimi movie\". PLAYED THE FIRST LEVEL....THEN UNINSTALLED. This games is all about ads. Sorry, waste of time.",
            "Way to many adds!!!! Before each level and after each level, so after finishing a level you must watch 2 adds to start next lvl. Too greedy ppl got nothing (from me at least). This trash is in trash. Today is April, 6 2019 . Nothing got changed since my first review, and I got response from customer service saying they will. May be instead of trying to make developers develop good game you have to change developers?"

Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

SCHEDULE supports the retake of missed sessions in history now. Try and get more circles.<br>2. Another upgrade! Tap the screen to check the pose list while exercising. It&#39;s much easier to browse and switch poses now.<br>3. New Courses in November: Winter Energy Flow-Intermediate Element Yoga, Easy Morning Yoga.<br>Monthly Golden Day, Thanksgiving, and Black Friday are coming!",
        "comments": [
            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "I really have nothing else to say. The app is a lost cause. I made a point many years ago when the app was first launched about the app kept messing up the syncing process between the quantity or record of a wine entry with the record at the database server. This problem was never fixed! Today I found the same error with the quantity of a wine I have just couple days ago, and I found the quantity of the wine was unchanged. Can u trust a tech company can't even get its database syncing right?",
            "This should allow two ratings. For looking up wines and getting descriptions and reviews, this app is great. You can even take a photo of the label and most of the time it'll find it. This has kept me away from accidentally buying sweet wines (not my gig). Love it for this use. Then I used Vivino for ordering wine - I have done it twice. Once the order was placed and weeks later it didn't ship. No notice why or if it would be shipped. Cancelled that. Later I tried again, ordering a case of one of my go-to wines from a different sub-retailer in Vivino. The order was shipped in a very reasonable time this order, but upon opening it they had substituted for the entire case with a different wine. No warning, just did it. Were it one bottle, I would be (only) ok with this, but for a case, without warning, this is unacceptable. The thing that has ended my ordering on Vivino is that, having had this happen, I can't get Vivino to even answer an email or respond to the 'contact' tab on their site. I frankly don't know if anyone works there anymore, certainly nobody is manning the email address or contact input. I have reached out both ways for the third time today and will be calling the credit card to have the charges reversed.",
            "Why only 4 stars?! The application is good, pretty sure I'll use it for several times, but the 1st thing I noticed, that the tutorial after the \"see how it works\" button is completely unreadable (at least for me it is..). Light brownish background with small grey text. Please take into consideration to change it. :)",
            "Love it and recommend it often. It's a great way to broaden your palette. I've tried so many new wines based on a decent rating and generally been happy I did. Also helped me to avoid a few bad ones.",
            "Used to be a good app, but now it's just annoying when it takes over your screen to install a non-existent update, that usually comes along a week after the first red screen appears. Suggestions to remove the annoyance have gone unheard (contacted via the app)"
