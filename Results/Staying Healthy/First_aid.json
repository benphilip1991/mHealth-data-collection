            "Great app. I have been a bystander at multiple fatal accidents in my life. This would have better helped me render aid while waiting on the emergency services. Love the gps to local hospitals function. I am new to my area and I learned of several hospitals of which I was unaware.",
            "Love this app. I especially like that the content is viewable offline. Because you never know when you might be in an emergency situation and not have wifi or cellular service. That was a very smart implementation.",
            "The app has gone downhill. Do you have lawyers and politicians involved in writing the contents? Are you afraid of liability to the point where you dilute the content to uselessness? Too many clicks, not enough pictures or examples, to the point of not being practical. The Canadian Red Cross First aid app is SO MUCH better.",
            "This app is great! The only reason for not giving five stars is because I would like to see more in depth information, and I know it's possible, as well as more sanarios added (e.g. electric shock).",
            "I appreciate the fact that you are really serious about optimizing your app and not like other apps being \"optimized every week\" and barely anything being noticed about the optimization, so I'm really happy about everything you are doing guys and so good job ❤️"

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.",

            "My furnace was awesome I learned a lot the biggest thing I learned was a pet temperature if I took a piss temperature and I saw it was a hundred and I would think I was high and be worried and scared when in fact just normal and I had no idea you would do is 30 repetitions when with a human it's only half dozen approximately thank you for putting this together",
            "I wish the app covered the amount of any given substance that may be dangerous given a dog or cat's size, health status, etc. I understand they don't want to discourage humans from seeking help when they should, though. One thing I do think should be changed: \"tylenol/acetaminophen\" is listed separately from \"pain relievers,\" and since it comes later alphabetically, a human checking the list of toxic substances could stop at \"pain relievers\" and never see the information they need.",
            "Very informative! I really appreciate the quizzes the app offers to test your knowledge and keep your skills sharp for situations where first aid is needed.",
            "Alot of very helpful information. Life saving information and more! Great app and thanks for it.",
            "🐈 A great guide for cat and dog basic first aid! 🐕 While not a replacement for proper veterinary care, this app is very well done and easy to follow, full of useful info for dealing with a large variety of problems pet owners might face - with not just facts, but also videos to guide you in performing emergency first aid properly. It even has a place to put your vet's emergency contact number for quick reference, and quizzes so you can test yourself on what you've learned. Highly recommended!"

The units don't coincide with each other , and most of the advice is just to call 911. Good idea, just needs some improvement.",
            "Bug on first page There's a bug where, at the top banner of the first page where you scroll, there are 3 pictures you can click on for links, one says Learn To Swim, one says Croix Rouge on a hospital bed, and there 3rd one is bugged out, you can't actually scroll to it and it'll scroll back to the first picture automatically. I'm on Android on a Nokia Note 8 if that helps. Other than that, it's great",
            "Good information. However when you do the testing, even if you hit the correct answer it says it's wrong. I even tried reinstalling. It still didn't work.",

Let’s take a look!\r\n\r\nIn Case of Being Bitten by a Pet\r\nCut the soap into pieces and put them in water. Make soapy water to clean the wound. Take a cotton swab to dip in the disinfectant and apply it to the wound. Kids, if you are bitten by a pet, call for emergency medical services and go to the hospital for treatment! \r\n\r\nIn Case of Sprain or Cut\r\nThe little girl has a sprained ankle. Her arm is injured too. She needs first aid! Take an ice pack and put it on the sprained ankle to reduce the swelling! Then wrap it with a bandage. Don't forget to pad her feet to alleviate the pain!

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training. First aid refers to the immediate treatment of an individual(s) that is injured or ill. First aid is not a full medical treatment.",

More than a thousand people have experienced enhanced well being and better life quality after using the Let Go and Feel It  exercises. The Mental First Aid App was developed based on 7 years of experience with techniques to getting in touch with your feelings. One of the strengths of using Mental First Aid lies in being able to solve mental challenges without having to tell your story.\r\n\r\nThe App is downloadable for free and may be used by all, who wish to work on personal development. The App is also being used in individual coaching sessions and in mental first aid projects.\r\n\r\nThe Mental First Aid App consists of 2 guided exercises: Let Go (of your thoughts) and Feel It \r\n(dissolve the discomfort).\r\n\r\nBoth the Let Go and Feel it exercises help to prevent stress, enhance well being and can help fight anxiety, insecurity, overwhelm, anger and sadness and other emotions that are limiting you.\r\n\r\nBy using the Let Go exercise you will be able to let go of your thoughts and experience a sense of inner calm. The exercise enhances your ability to focus and concentrate in situations that demand your full attention.\r\nWhen using the Let Go exercise on a continual basis you will gradually find it easier to let your thoughts go. This will give you inner calmness and allow you to acces your intuitive wisdom, which will lead you to be clear about your choice of action in specific situations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Feel it exercise is to dissolve any emotional discomfort, you may be experiencing in specific situations such as:\r\n\r\n-\tI dont think I am good enough \r\n-\tI am caught up in my stream of thoughts and have a hard time concentrating \r\n-\tI feel insecure about all these changes\r\n-\tI often get overwhelmed by sadness\r\n-\tI have a hard time saying no and am easily overburdened\r\n-\tI get angry very easily and overreact\r\n-\tI have a hard time saying what I really think, fearing what others might think of me\r\n\r\nBy going into the emotion and feeling the discomfort you are experiencing, you are able to dissolve the discomfort. When this happens, you will find that situations in which you were previously emotionally affected - no longer have the same effect on you. You will experience inner calm and a strong sense of presence in the same situations.\r\n\r\nThe Feel It exercise is not a thought exercise, but a feeling exercise. The fewer thoughts you have filling your mind, before you go into the Feel It exercise, the greater your benefit. Bearing this in mind, it is a good idea to complete the Let Go exercise, before you do the Feel It exercise.\r\n\r\nTo begin with you need to define, which challenge you wish to work with. You then recall a situation which exemplifies where you feel the discomfort you want to get rid of.\r\n\r\nUsing a headset and keeping your eyes closed while completing the exercises will give you the best effect.",

        "description": "First aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\n\r\n-This is the best app for saving your life in emergency situation.\r\n\r\n-First aid app can be used before you reached to the hospital.\r\n\r\n-First Aid has the perfect introduction for your medical help.\r\n\r\n-It includes safety tips for basic first aid information  like \"asthma, bleeding, choking, snake bites, scorpion bites, fainting , brocken bones\" etc.\r\n\r\n-First Aid gets  you step by step information about your medical help.\r\n\r\nThe term usually refers to administering care to a human, although it can also be performed on animals.\r\n\r\nThe first step in any emergency is the recognition of the problem and providing help. When in doubt or when someone is seriously injured or ill, you should always activate the emergency response system by calling 911. If you’re not sure how serious the situation is, the 911 operator will ask you a series of questions to determine the seriousness of it.\r\n\r\nRemain on the line until additional help arrives, or until the 911 operator tells you to hang up. Emergency system dispatchers can guide you through the steps of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), using an automatic external defibrillator (AED), or delivering basic care until additional help arrives.\r\n\r\nWhether you are at home, work, or school, know where the first aid kit and the AED are kept and be familiar with their contents. Know how to activate the emergency response system (by calling 911 if in the United States). Be aware of any policies in the workplace regarding medical emergencies.\r\n\r\nAfter determining the problem, the next step in providing help is to determine the unresponsiveness of the injured or ill person. The best way to determine this is to tap the person and talk loudly to them: “Are you okay?” After determining unresponsiveness, yell for help.

        "descriptionHTML": "First aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.<br><br>-This is the best app for saving your life in emergency situation.<br><br>-First aid app can be used before you reached to the hospital.<br><br>-First Aid has the perfect introduction for your medical help.<br><br>-It includes safety tips for basic first aid information  like &quot;asthma, bleeding, choking, snake bites, scorpion bites, fainting , brocken bones&quot; etc.<br><br>-First Aid gets  you step by step information about your medical help.<br><br>The term usually refers to administering care to a human, although it can also be performed on animals.<br><br>The first step in any emergency is the recognition of the problem and providing help. When in doubt or when someone is seriously injured or ill, you should always activate the emergency response system by calling 911. If you’re not sure how serious the situation is, the 911 operator will ask you a series of questions to determine the seriousness of it.<br><br>Remain on the line until additional help arrives, or until the 911 operator tells you to hang up. Emergency system dispatchers can guide you through the steps of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), using an automatic external defibrillator (AED), or delivering basic care until additional help arrives.<br><br>Whether you are at home, work, or school, know where the first aid kit and the AED are kept and be familiar with their contents. Know how to activate the emergency response system (by calling 911 if in the United States). Be aware of any policies in the workplace regarding medical emergencies.<br><br>After determining the problem, the next step in providing help is to determine the unresponsiveness of the injured or ill person. The best way to determine this is to tap the person and talk loudly to them: “Are you okay?” After determining unresponsiveness, yell for help. Look for any medical identifications, such as a necklace or a bracelet.

But when there is an emergency, it will help you to know what to do to in those few crucial moments when basic knowledge of first aid can make the difference.<br><br>Nothing is more tragic than a life lost needlessly. You can be the difference between life and death.<br><br>Please note: The first aid advice is based solely upon UK protocols. Both the UK and European emergency service numbers are provided.",

        "description": "When a nonmedical service member comes upon an unconscious or injured service member, he must accurately evaluate the casualty to determine the first aid measures needed to prevent further injury or death. He should seek medical assistance as soon as possible, but he should not interrupt the performance of first aid measures. To interrupt the first aid measures may cause more harm than good to the casualty. Remember that in a chemical environment, the service member should not evaluate the casualty until the casualty has been masked. After performing first aid, the service member must proceed with the evaluation and continue to monitor the casualty for development of conditions which may require the performance of necessary basic lifesaving measures, such as clearing the airway, rescue breathing, preventing shock, and controlling bleeding. He should continue to monitor the casualty until relieved by medical personnel.\r\n\r\nService members may have to depend upon their first aid knowledge and skills to save themselves (self-aid) or other service members (buddy aid/ combat lifesaver). They may be able to save a life, prevent permanent disability, or reduce long periods of hospitalization by knowing WHAT to do, WHAT NOT to do, and WHEN to seek medical assistance.\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of various body armor systems currently fielded to US service members, and those in development for future fielding, may present a temporary obstacle to effective evaluation of an injured service member. You may have to carefully remove the body armor from the injured service member to complete the evaluation or administer first aid. Begin by removing the outer– most hard or soft body armor components (open, unfasten or cut the closures, fasteners, or straps), then remove any successive layers in the same manner. Be sure to follow other notes, cautions and warnings regarding procedures in contaminated situations and when a broken back or neck is suspected. Continue to evaluate.\r\nThis manual meets the first aid training needs of individual service members. Because medical personnel will not always be readily available, the nonmedical service members must rely heavily on their own skills and knowledge of life-sustaining methods to survive on the integrated battlefield. This publication outlines both self-aid and aid to other service members (buddy aid). More importantly, it emphasizes prompt and effective action in sustaining life and preventing or minimizing further suffering and disability. First aid is the emergency care given to the sick, injured, or wounded before being treated by medical personnel. The term first aid can be defined as “urgent and immediate lifesaving and other measures, which can be performed for casualties by nonmedical personnel when medical personnel are not immediately available.” Nonmedical service members have received basic first aid training and should remain skilled in the correct procedures for giving first aid. This manual is directed to all service members. The procedures discussed apply to all types of casualties and the measures described are for use by both male and female service members.",

        "description": "First Aid Afloat is a quick reference and revision tool covering first aid from a boating perspective. In the event of a medical emergency at sea, first aid knowledge and swift action can save lives. \r\n\r\nThe app provides essential knowledge of first aid for all those going afloat in small craft, whether on inland waters, rivers, estuaries or up to 60 miles offshore. The app is a useful revision aid for those studying first aid at sea courses. It is also a useful tool in the event of a real life medical emergency at sea, including how to contact emergency services for medical help and rescue, how to carry out medical assessment and how to deal with specific injuries and illnesses.\r\n\r\nYou may be the vital link between a casualty and professional help ashore and will need skills and confidence to deal with a first aid situation aboard a vessel in challenging circumstances.This app will help provide a working knowledge of first aid procedures for injuries and illness at sea.

When you save a life, you create a life on Earth. By saving lives, you become the Lord’s messenger on Earth. So what are your chances of playing messenger, so you can save your mother, father, son, daughter, brother, wife, sister, and all your near and dear ones and even the not so near ones? \r\n\r\nHere are some numbers which suggest you stand a good chance of saving your family, your loved ones and probably yourself. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US (every year 225000 people die and 6 out of 1000 are prone to have a heart attack in the US). If that sounds scary, the world’s two most populous nations, India and China, each with a billion plus population, have a far more accelerating growth rate of heart attacks. As a case in point, coronary heart attack in urban India is more than ten percent and growing. Rest of the world does not differ too much either. \r\n\r\nThese growing numbers metaphorically indicate that the hearts are getting smaller and weaker, the arteries which carry blood to the heart are also getting smaller in comparison to the bulging pockets, bulging cholesterol in the arteries, the bulging stressful lives, and the bulging sedentary lifestyle we are leading. \r\n\r\nBut you can play God, e r Messenger. You can save lives. Hundreds of them. All you need is to understand and get trained on CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation). You can save people affected by heart attacks. It’s as easy as 123. CPR ensures flow of blood to the brain, even after the stoppage of a heart due to cardiac arrest, and keeps the person alive. To help you get started on CPR, we have this small little app with the latest CPR guidelines, CPR principles, legal, technical, devices, steps, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the real world, you may skip an internet connection in a trail in the Tundras or the Grand Canyon or in the Amazon rain forest, or in the Canadian Prairies, but the heart may skip a beat anywhere, for any of your loved ones.

            "An exceptionally useful app where this service is available. Though it only happened once, it told me exactly where to go for a nearby CPR request. Luckily, the person didn't need CPR, but it indeed worked. Keep in mind that this only works if your city's Emergency Services have paid for the PulsePoint contract. Although you could argue privacy concerns, I feel saving a life trumps privacy. Helpful side benefit, it can also tell you where car accidents are, so it helps as a navigation aid too.",
            "Good basic information of situations in the area or nearby. More follow up info would be helpful to know if a situation is contained or cleared. If possible, traffic associated with affected areas would be good in order to change routes if necessary. The ability to narrow to one geographical region/area vs just by depts. for overnight/sleep mode would be a nice addition so you can be alerted for only certain areas while you sleep.",
            "The only improvement would be adding more detail to the incidents when possible, but that would take tremendous resources and so for a free app with no intrusive ads this is perfect. I now know within minutes or even seconds from hearing sirens if it is a vehicle collision, vegetation or vehicle fire, medical emergency and more. I can reroute myself or call neighbors or loved ones or even work. Living in a rural community this app could literally be a life saver with the CPR notifications.",
            "Update: The agency I follow and was offline, was contacted by Pulse Point. They were told they know of problems and were fixing. Sound came back on yesterday. Thank you for helping me. Update: Been told the agency I'm following must have cut the feed. Loved this app. Been using for months. Then all of sudden when sound button pressed it will not stay on. So no sound. I've checked all settings. Removed and reinstalled no sound.",
            "It helps to know where events are happening. When a notice comes up while looking at the map the box with the info is over half the map making it hard to see the area on the alert. I did not sign up for the CPR alerts but it overwhelms with the broken heart icon. ( accidents)"

            "This is good with the exception of being limited on actions due to it being a demo. Its good but not really worth paying for unfortunately.",
            "It's fairly fun. Definitely unique. I'm playing on Android, which for all I know is causing my issue with the accuracy of taps and control. I would consider upgrading to the full version, even with my mild qualms, but not for $6.49... I would put this somewhere in the ballpark of $3.99 if the quality of control was perfected. The demo also gives me no idea what sort of vehicle/weapon upgrades would become available if I decided to pay. I'll stick by 3/5 stars."

            "Thank you for this very helpful app. However, I would like to request a setting to see the notifications in original Korean. The English translations are actually very bad and hard to understand. There are many foreigners (like me) that can use a little Korean. With the option to see the original Korean, we can translate the parts we don't understand by ourselves. Currently, I believe most foreigners will not be able to understand the poor English translations and this could be dangerous.",
            "EDIT: Thank you for responding! Please make it more obvious for what areas I'm getting notifications (like a map), and use regular notifications rather than your custom full-screen ones. ORIGINAL: Ridiculous. I get a full-screen notification of some \"emergency\" every 30min. It turns my phone on in bed and in my pocket and keeps the screen on. And the alerts are machine-translated so half the time they don't make any sense. I'm reviewing this while the COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak is happening, but this is complete overkill. The notification \"XYZ location is getting regularly disinfected\" should go away, or be a regular notification, not full screen blocking everything.",
            "Way too disruptive. Translations are not accurate. Annoying to have 15 alerts every 10 minutes.",
            "Great to get translation of messages, but the location service doesn't work. So, I'm getting notifications from the whole country and it's running down the battery on my phone waking it up every other minute.",

            "I've played this game before, and I love it. But now that I've reinstalled it, it isn't loading. Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "Love this. Gameplay in all ways (freeplay and campaign) is very fun and challenging. I haven't played any other formats of this (laptop/PC), but it is still very good. The only thing I could think of to add is another few expansions allowing more types of disasters, like a plane crash or a nuclear bomb being detonated (on the bigger cities like New York and Washington DC). But in any case, the game is good enough as it is. Will always be a favourite.",
            "112 isn't compatible with my device, which is sad, my laptop barely runs it and would never manage expansions. My LGV20 couldn't do it and I was crushed. But I'm still grateful to have 911. All the expansions on my PC 911 - which runs with zero issues, I'll get them all eventually on cell. This series is one of my favorite to date. Highly addicting, endlessly playable, actually runs smoothest on my LGV20. Still crushed about 112 but 911 is a comfort.",
            "It has some control issues because it's a direct port of a computer game with no modification for mobile. And there's all this stuff you can buy but it doesn't tell you what any of it does. But it's addicting, endless fun answering 911 calls and deciding what to do and then dispatching units. The calls can get repetitive but there are DLC. Overall a lot of fun and I'm not even sure why. But I love it. It's one of the few mobile games I've liked.",
            "Great App, however gets rather boring after a week of playing as calls and scenarios are the same thing. I've purchased all DLC's and the events are great. The game is fun after days of playing but then the calls repeat. The events are great but I feel like this game isn't worth it. It would also be much more fun if we had the option to choose events if we wanted too on free game mode. This game is fun and addictive, but it needs more calls and additional stuff. I would pay for another DLC.",
            "Not sure if I'm having unique problems, but half of this game's features don't seem to work for me. I can't make new teams, can't move between windows or scroll down in the shop. Interface is very clunky in general. Played one game and it was also not what I was expecting it to be. Refunded."
