So I tried once more to add a person to my family tree that they had recommended and it still tells me to upgrade so what the hell is the 129.00 for ? Now I am in a dispute to get my money back that should never had been taken. They suck and I actually rate them negative 10 stars !",
            "The site makes it hard to cancel the free description. They make u go thru 4-5 pages & u have to fill out your information & number & keep asking over & over for extra confirmation to cancel the free trial. That's so aggravating. Also, the site didn't show my family in Costa Rica, seems like it only can search in the United States.",

Since no comprehensive treatment of this is available, we start by gathering different contributions that can give a more or less coherent picture of the microfoundations for this relationship. Having established such microfoundations, we then move to analyze the impact of diversity on policies and productivity through a simple reduced-form model.\r\nFrom the “tragedy of Africa” to social problems of American cities, the effects of racial conflict have risen to the center of attention not only of policymakers but also of academic researchers.1 While sociologists and political scientists have long been aware of the importance of these issues, only recently economists have begun paying more systematic attention to them. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the question: is ethnic diversity “good” or “bad” from an economic point of view, and why? Its potential costs are fairly evident. Conflict of preferences, racism, prejudices often lead to policies which are suboptimal from the point of view of society as a whole, and to the oppression of minorities which may then explode in civil wars or at least in disruptive political instability. But an ethnic mix also brings about variety in abilities, experiences, cultures which may be productive and may lead to innovation and creativity. The United States are the quintessential example of these two faces of racial relations in a “melting pot”. While much evidence points toward the problem of racial heterogeneity in US cities, the racially mixed and racially troubled New York City and Los Angeles are constant producers of innovation in the arts and business. In what follows we try to highlight the trade off between the benefits of “variety” and complexity and the costs of heterogeneity of preferences in a multi-ethnic society. In order to bring more evidence to bear on this question we plan to examine jointly two strands of the literature that have proceeded in a parallel way: one on cross country comparisons, and one on local communities. The latter is itself split into two sub areas with little communication between the two, namely the public and urban economics literature on US cities on the one hand, and the development literature which focuses on groups and local communities on the other. Within both strands of the literature, one approach takes the size and number of jurisdictions (countries or localities) as given, and studies the effects of different degrees of ethnic fragmentation on quality of government, economic policies, growth, unrest, crime, civil wars etc. A second and less developed approach focuses on the fact that the number and size of political jurisdictions is itself determined by the ethnic composition of the population.",

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

Really disappointed in an app that started off so great.",

It totally sucks that there is no save button, because more than once I've went back in and they deducted coins that I've collected, but they've also restarted the pages I was coloring. It sucks when you spend all that time, only to have to start over.",

This is the *only* thing out there. Though it can't really convey the real experience, especially long term, it does a good job--particularly the videos--of educating through simulation. For that reason, it should be applauded. It would be nice to have a tool to identify/change one's own limiting attitudes.",

I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Loved this app until I got paid version. There are too few filers and it gets boring. None of the previous filters are in it, and I've seen many over the past couple of years. The fun section still only does side by side comparison instead of the whole picture. I'm not sure why it's so expensive with so few features. What it does do, it does very well. Impressions and presets are almost identical, make up too. A few pre-made looks could do the trick e.g \"Beach babe\" , \"barbie\", \"dictator\"",
            "I absolutely love this app. There is honestly no better app of its type. A massive problem though, is that I couldn't pay for the lifetime membership :( - the monthly plan works, but i wanted the lifetime plan... I'm new to Android, so if it's something that I need to fix, can you please inform me. I tried reinstalling the app multiple times, and added many different payment methods (all with enough money in the accounts) my problems aside, even the free version of this app is worth 5 stars.",
            "This is the first time I'm saying, \" Today, 22-10-2020, I'm declaring that if there is a option to give 7 🌟, then I must give that. Seriously 😘. This AI app is the best of best! If I want to change the face or other tasks it will take an hour in Photoshop. Thanks for giving us Pro feature using Ad. Stay happy all the time, take care and stay safe at home 🏡.",
            "I absolutely love this app! There are still so many features available even without the paid version, and they actually all look real!! However, I am encountering one issue. For some reason, the \"My kids\" 1 and 2 are taking FOREVER to load. I know it's not an wifi problem because all the other ones load just fine and my wifi is really good. I will definitely change my review to a 5 star once this is fixed, thank you!",
            "This app is very good. I love the option on the app that allows you to see what your future children may look like. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because of minor errors such as having the girls look like 80 year old men or making the children look more like girls in the boy part instead of boys. I also suggest that this app would be really cool if an anime option was added. I've seen videos on this, and I think it would make the app more successful and up in rankings! Thanks!"

            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

Most of the skins are bad but the only good ones are the impossible ad ones. And some of the obstacles kill you even if you duck or dodge it. Worst of all, I hit in the green zone on an epic level and got killed somehow.",

Epic level is just like this just for coins.Coins we can collect while winning. I am angry due to so many ads after each level ad. For opening chest room ad. For new skin ad , means this game is filled with ads and I don't like the games which have ads.I am not satisfied with the game and. I wanted to give zero stars to it.",
            "Experience on this game is amazing you can get so much out there you can get new Skins and it can sort teach you how to be more skilled to but the game is quite buggy the game is kind of different it's not a normal game and I would not recommend this game well I would but but if you ever played this game I'm sure you feel same way but all you need to do right now is just download the app",

            "I rate this Five because this is cool for me i don't mind it the ads. The ads it's little, i like this game i love so much i think i'm up too 100 but it's fine this game i like it."

Instructions are not always comprehendable. Some of us need \" Google Go for Dummies\"... I like this app, but it's appears when using other apps. Otherwise, interference, unpredictable behavior and isn't stable.",
            "The app is pretty good. As it says it's fun to search and it's life too? The only issue I have is with downloads. We can't download pages like we can in chrome. Since there is no multiple tabs option there should atleast be an option where I can save some sites I wanna read later. If this is the only browser app a person uses like me then it's not so efficient. Coz I disabled chrome since it takes up a lot of space. Please do something about this. Else it's a great app. No complaints. 😄",
            "This app is great, and a great alternative to Chrome and Google. It is very easy to use and it has Google Assistant built into it when you voice search. It has a lite, incognito, and normal. It is very nice how you do not have to download two apps to get lite versions of the whistle your need. It is an all in one app, ready for use I'm ready for improvement. for me it is very good I don't think it needs much",
            "Excellent for many features, 1. Multiple sessions, each search in a separate window. 2. Lite mode, pages load faster and easier to read 3. More convenient search box location. 4. Opens some of the blocked sites in some countries. 5. Has bookmarks to open frequently visited pages. And more... The bad: if you left the app to another app then back, the page reloads again, very annoying when you read and compare two pages.",
            "This is a very good light browser. Very fast, always loads practically instantly even on my 4 year old s7. Very helpful side features; though I dont use them very much personally, I can see that many people would. It gives relevant search suggestions. Some features such as advanced searches are missing, but I have found that I mainly use this for finding a fact or an image quickly. Then, if I need more information, I switch to my normal browser, firefox."

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

            "Nice interface. Though each type of device has a different user experience, (iOS, Android, MacOS), a little weird but each is still very good. I like the ability to add and subtract areas if interest. They mark ads/sponsored posts pretty well. Pretty speedy on all devices, even somewhat older ones. Overall a nice news agragator.",
            "I've been using flipboard for years. Now like 80% of the content is videos. And NONE of those videos actually play. It's so weird. They have some new video set up, every time I click on a video, it doesn't play. Just black screen. Click on it, it goes to another black screen. So, two major problems rendering this app useless: 1. Nearly all news is now in the form of videos. I don't want videos. I want to read, and 2. Those videos don't even work. How do you not beta test this, Flipboard??",
            "If I open a page on source like golf or mma or something like that, I get articles that cover something else entirely. I'm really annoyed that I spend more time reporting articles that are not on topic and I don't know why this hasn't changed in years of reporting these articles... Please do something about this.",
            "Been using flipboard for quite some time since you can customize what news you see or just flip through all news. Biggest down side is tbe comment section is really subpar and broken up into different sections. Dont even bother commenting if you see 100 plus comments because your comment is lost at the bottom. Other than that is a nice app to see any news you want.",
            "Can't share URL if you click a link inside an article. Steps to repro: 1. Tap into an article 2. Tap any link on the page that goes to a different site 3. Observe the top toolbar shrinks from several items to 2 items. 4. Tap the share button in that toolbar 5. Pick literally anything on share sheet. 6. See \"Couldn't Share item\" error every time. If you fix this bug lmk and I'll revise my review! Update: Flipboard denied this obvious, reproducible bug. Smh. Bug does not happen on ios."

            "Used to love this game. Hadn't played in a little while and wanted to play again. Saying the ads are excessive is being kind. The free version didn't used to be like this. It's not even playable anymore and the only way to remove the obnoxious amount of ads is to get the subscription at $2.99/wk. Sadly 'Uninstall' is the best option.",
            "This used to be one of my favorite games. Now they have added a completely excessive amount of ads. After every guess, right or wrong, I get an add. THIS WHOLE GAME HAS JUST BECOME NON-STOP ADDS. I spend more time now watching adds then playing the game. It takes me 3 seconds to make my new guess and type it...but then I get a 45 second long add🤬🤬🤬🤬",
            "I have been playing this a lot lately, it's good fun and addictive. Some of the levels repeat (I just got exact same picture I've had before) but good variety overall. However the addition of ads popping up after guesses is really annoying. I could put up with it for hints or at the end of a level but it's really off-putting now. My other negative would be once you advance in the game you have to scroll all the way down every time. It would be nice to have a way to jump down to where you're at.",
            "An ad after every guess?! What the hell people? I've played this game for quiet a while and have always enjoyed it. Now I'm uninstalling it because that is obnoxious that you feel the need to flood people with ads after every guess. Right or wrong. Doesn't matter. Here's an ad. Oh whats that? Another one? You sure? Its only been one word, but okay. BAM!!!! ANOTHER AD!!!!",
            "Haven't played in a long time and decided to reinstall it. Mad at my self for doing it. There is an ad after each guess making it enjoyable like it use to be. Had to uninstall. Understand having ads but that was way to much."

            "The game is really fun. There are way too many ads but it's a free game so I'm willing to accept them. I like that you can also watch a video for 3 extra moves if needed, no strings attached, no payments, no coin cost. The only real issue I have is occasionally it won't let me place a rope in the end slot which then means I have to fiddle with the order and can mean I lose the level. It's not always it's just a little annoying, even when I position it carefully it happens.",
            "TOO MANY ADS. NOT WORTH IT. Gave it 5 stars yesterday...big mistake. One star is all it really deserves. It is fun but after each 'level' (which takes anywhere from 30 sec to 2 min)you are BOMBARDED with 2 or more BLARING ADS lasting more than the play itself!! I am uninstalling this game. Actually, all-in-all, not enjoyable at all. Trust me when I tell you not to take up space on your phone. (BTW, developed in Turkey, not the USA) It would be more enjoyable to pick your nose.",
            "At first I was enjoying it, but soon I founded it very addictive and annoying at the same time, due to the very short time they give you to solve the difficult ones, it's taking me about 20 attempts to solve just one , very stressful and it's starting to make me mad, plus it has a lot of long adds I'm uninstalling it.",
            "While I am enjoying this game as a way to relax in between moments, I have found no use for the coins collected. You use them to purchase the visual mods but you can also win these. I'd adjust it to a leveling system or provide MANY more options for purchase. With the adds, while frequent, I have seen much worse. My only issue with them is that when I first started playing most would automatically be muted. As I often listen to audiobooks this was a great selling point. Please bring this back.",
            "At first the game was enjoyable. Nice way to spend a few seconds. But the tangles are repetitive. With 3 or 4 ropes and only 5 spaces to use to untangle, there aren't a lot of options. I'm up to level 450. I have over 165,000 coins. I still have no idea what to do with them. And, as other reviews as said, the ratio of ad watching to actual game play is way out of balance. An adult themed pregnant wife, cheating husband game app ad when children could be playing is inappropriate."

        "description": "White people is a racial classification specifier, used mostly and often exclusively for people of European descent; depending on context, nationality, and point of view. The term has at times been expanded to encompass persons of Middle Eastern and North African descent, persons who are often considered non-white in other contexts. The usage of \"white people\" or a \"white race\" for a large group of mainly or exclusively European populations, defined by their light skin, among other physical characteristics, and contrasting with \"black people\", Amerindians, and other \"colored\" people or \"persons of color\", originated in the 17th century. It was only during the 19th century that this vague category was transformed in a quasi-scientific system of race and skin color relations. The term \"Caucasian\" is sometimes used as a synonym for \"white\" in its racial sense and sometimes to refer to a larger racial category that includes white people among other groups.\r\n\r\nThe concept of a unified white race did not achieve universal acceptance in Europe when it first came into use in the 17th century, or in the centuries afterward. The strongest proponent of racialism in 20th-century Europe, Nazi Germany, regarded some European peoples such as Slavs as racially distinct from themselves. Prior to the modern age, no European peoples regarded themselves as \"white\", but rather defined their race, ancestry, or ethnicity in terms of their nationality. Moreover, there is no accepted standard for determining the geographic barrier between white and non-white people. Contemporary anthropologists and other scientists, while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations, regard the concept of a \"white race\" as socially constructed.\r\n\r\nThe concept of whiteness has particular resonance in racially diverse countries with large majority or minority populations of more or less mixed European ancestry: e.g., in the United States (White Americans), Canada (White Canadians), Australia (White Australians), New Zealand (White New Zealanders), the United Kingdom (White British), and South Africa (White South Africans). In much of the rest of Europe, the distinction between race and nationality is more blurred; when people are asked to describe their race or ancestry, they often describe it in terms of their nationality. Various social constructions of whiteness have been significant to national identity, public policy, religion, population statistics, racial segregation, affirmative action, white privilege, eugenics, racial marginalization, and racial quotas.\r\n\r\nThe term \"white race\" or \"white people\" entered the major European languages in the later 17th century, in the context of racialized slavery and unequal social status in the European colonies. Description of populations as \"white\" in reference to their skin color predates this notion and is occasionally found in Greco-Roman ethnography and other ancient or medieval sources, but these societies did not have any notion of a white, pan-European race. Scholarship on race distinguishes the modern concept from pre-modern descriptions, which focused on physical complexion rather than race.[1]",

I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "I have been playing HERO WARS for a long time. In my opinion best PVP game around. You can't really buy your way to the top like other games . Spending money will help but for people like myself on a budget. Not kidding this is the best of the best . . I would say from time to time they will over price themselves and I an most people will walk away from what they are selling. The other thing I like its truly a team event if you want to win everything.",
            "Loved the game. Not as much anymore. If you are going to start this game. do research and start on a russian server with FB and switch to american. Every thing is so much cheaper and you will be able to max out for WAY less. This is pay to play once you get to a reasonable lvl. FB has a way more devoloped game! Don't play it unless you do it on FB. do your research! Don't say I didn't warn you :) i didnt do my research lol",
            "so far, i like the game. it is simple and cute, but at the same time, carries/need strategy if you want to go up in the arena ladder. with this in mind, it is a very pay-to-win game. my suggestion would be to lower the time of the energy refill to make the players play more, and lower the gold consumption for skillups. i already spent money in this game to see the difference, and i support you guys. but maybe, this game will entice more players if you at least do my suggestions.",
            "this game is amazing but becomes a chore later on still if you are open to meeting new people I would tell you this game is a fun. If you have some people who enjoys the game then it is amazing. there are many discord servers available for your particular taste. you need to find the correct place. You can jump servers and then invest in game when you find a home where you find like-minded people. I am giving a 4 star just because they stopped emerald task fishing using vpn. which i hate now.",
            "I have played this game for almost 2 years and have spend a lot of money. It used to be an enjoyable way to be entertained. Then they decided to change platforms and there has been nothing but problems with the game ever since. I will no longer spend good money on a broken game, nor do I expect to play it much longer, even if they fix the last 'update' error."

            "I transferred the entire contents of a uSD card to a larger capacity card using Memory Zone. Two things: 1. The file list should scroll as files are copied/moved so you can see where you are in the process. 2. Much more importantly, the timestamps on the copied/moved files *should be the same as the original files*. Having 200 gb of files with the current date and time is useless. I will now have to do the entire thing again using a different utility. The app is useless until this is corrected.",
            "My first attempt to copy a video worked, so went ahead and moved a bunch of pics using this app. All files are on the USB but are unable to open on any device stating \"unsupported file type\" and I can't find how to fix so my pics are lost. Awful experience, I'll be seeking a refund 👎👎👎",
            "I would not recommend this app at this time, because I can't use it. I have to: grant the SD card (which is SanDisk card) access to the SanDisk Memory Zone app in order to complete the operation. The directions that come with the app are incomplete at best. So far using this app has been a waste of time. I can't transfer anything at this point. I've tried contacting you once before & I'm still waiting for an answer or acknowledgment. The SD card I have on my phone now is the SanDisk Ultra Plus microSDXC UHS-I card with Adapter 64GB. The small card is the one I can use on my phone.",
            "I loooove the App.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can't get my songs to play one after the other. If you could make that happen I would give 10 stars. Apart from that I love the App. Soooo glad I can edit and rename and move my music back and forth from folder to folder.",
            "One of the Best App in entire playstore. This app is extremely useful for your personal data Handling , Avoids Google drive file duplications shows your internal and external storages and also your cloud storages with proper details. Can move or copy data from one location to another very easily."

            "I love this keyboard, however, when I swipe a word (\"left\" or \"right\") for example, it corrects it to ← and →. This is FRUSTRATING. This keyboard lives around emojis, but km so tired of having to correct myself because of these things. And there's no setting to turn it off! Would give 5 stars, but this feature is a big setback for the keyboard",
            "Making me restart & unlock my phone BEFORE i can use the app... Um, no. Other DEVS are using the 'copy paste' method2 design their apps, skipping \"permission 2 collect data, card #'s, etc\" 1 suggestion.. W/cyber security on the rise & \"The Laws\" being so lax when it comes to white collar crimes, I suggest ya'll Devs figure it out or ask THOSE DEVS.. Bc by Xmas this yr, evry1 will be less trusting.. I had MY #'s stolen after 72 hrs of punching the #'s into an app. The new gateway 2 ID theft=apps!",
            "Its pretty fun. I actually like this app. more than 5 stars that ill rate but it only have 5 stars... now lets get back... its awesome it has many Emoji's and its gifts... thnx for this app... and thank u too for the some people wo made this app... pretty awesome... hey u... yes u... u should install this app... it has many emojis and costumes... love this app...",
            "Come on guys, really? There's no option to turn off converting my words into emojis? I know the app is built on emojis and that's a good thing if you're all about the emojis... but you have an option to turn off everything else! I type fast. I'm not going back into every sentence to turn symbols into words when they should be words in the first place and I've already done the work. This is still the best keyboard app I've found, but this new feature is really pushing it. It needs a toggle ASAP."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",

The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery.

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

        "description": "The Animal wildlands is a dangerous RPG world, where the forest animals guard their territory while hunting and surviving off the land. For centuries, the wolf packs have remained at the top of the food chain, maintaining the natural order, led by their alpha, the last remaining dire wolf. When the dire wolf goes missing, you must lead your pack to greatness. Select a gray wolf or a black wolf, and start building your ultimate wolfpack. A wild life simulation adventure awaits!\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE MULTIPLAYER BATTLES - PVP\r\n\r\nFight for dominance in the virtual world! Take on the world in online real-time multiplayer PvP battles. Hunt together with your team in co-op and battle enemy clans to control the most territory. Will you be the hunter or the hunted?\r\n\r\nUPGRADE YOUR BATTLE SKILLS\r\n\r\nCreate your ultimate RPG hero - you can choose which skills to learn and upgrade. Unique skills range from basic MMORPG abilities to fantasy elemental attacks - and even stealth skills which allow you to hide in the forest and become the ultimate predator!\r\n\r\nBREED & RAISE CUBS\r\n\r\nBuild a family and role play! A realistic breeding sim gives cubs stronger fighting attributes compared to their parents. Take your pups out with you as you raid other clans and hunt your prey. Your pups will watch your every move, learning important survival and life skills. Trail your pup well, else they will not stand a chance in the online multiplayer PvP battle arena.\r\n\r\nCOLLECT ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe alpha is the hero of each pack. You can duel enemy clans and recruit their alpha to your den. Collect wolves, foxes, bears and other wild animals, each with realistic and fantasy evolution skins. Each creature is rendered in stunning 3D graphics.\r\n\r\nLIVE THE STORY OF A WOLF CLAN\r\n\r\nA true survival simulator. When nature’s balance is threatened as the Great River has become contaminated, competition between the animals over the remaining spring water has begun. Even foreign tigers have been spotted far outside of their borders, causing concern amongst the rest of the animals.\r\n\r\nThere have also been rumours of ancient reptiles, rising to the surface from centuries of slumber, claiming the mountains and caves as their own. The gray wolves are now called upon to craft a solution in these troubled times.\r\n\r\nA MASSIVE OPEN WORLD\r\n\r\nExplore a huge, unbroken open MMO world teeming with wild life, from the dense forest, mountains to the freezing arctic. You can fight in online multiplayer PvP areas, tackle quests, role play, gather resources or raid enemy clans and take over their home. You might even encounter the tiger king on your adventure (a superior evolution of the natural tiger), who has been spotted in the forest for the first time in centuries!  \r\n\r\nGROUNDBREAKING 3D GRAPHICS\r\n\r\nExperience never before seen 3D graphics quality in a wildlife simulation MMO, with dynamic lighting and time of day cycles which bring the virtual world to life! Start your day at the mountain peaks, watching the sunrise with your pack before embarking on your adventure for survival and territory dominance.\r\n\r\nBUILD & DECORATE YOUR DEN\r\n\r\nCraft a home! Dig tunnels and secret passageways to expand your virtual family. Craft the best environment for your cubs, and raise a family to tackle the strongest predators in the forest.

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",
            "There are a lot of games that are exactly the same, so 0 points for originality, graphics are the bare minimum, kinda cutesy style. The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

One problem I had was the color change. I was changing the cover color to blue, and It didn't work although it said it was sugsessful. That was the only bug, It didn't even effect me, so this app is good.",
            "This app is incredible and secure plus if you have a password for your phone than it will be double security. And there is no loosing the lock its in your brain. And you can change the background, the font style and the font color. If you forget your password and you are signed in then they will send you the code. Pretty sweet so i recommend this to anyone who needs a dairy. 😇😍",
            "I like the app, it's really good. The only issue I have is the ad banner that tends to appear most of the way up the screen leaving grey. It's a pain to remove. Also, an idea for you... changing the layout of entried or notes. So you can choose for them to stay as they are, be in reverse order or a calendar layout. 👍",
            "This app is amazing, I love the way it is set up! Its always there to listen even though the stories might be boring, its always there to help you get things off your chest. Without this app I would still have stuff to think about and nowhere to go to talk things through. The only problem is that one time it did not save my progress but it was mainly my fault.",
            "Really good. Recommended. It tells you the date automatically and you can changes colour of text and theme by yourself with no charge. You can even change the colour of the app icon if you don't like pink colours. Many much more feature need to check it out yourself. It's free with ads so don't be afraid to try it out yourself."

I think the goal is to help him escape, but that is not really part of the gameplay. Occasionally, you get a popup that tells you he made progress on his escape tunnel, but that's all. I feel cheated. I thought this would be a combo between word play and escape games.",
            "Anyone remember the fake ads and reviews? Good times. Honestly doubt anyone will see this because nobody talks about this, and rightfully so, it's atrocious. Lazy and somehow a boring game. How the hell do you do that?! Kudos to the \"developers\" for whatever this was, it was something while it lasted. Move on and get something actually interesting.",
            "I enjoyed the game. However, the adds are a bit excessive. Yes, yes I know, adds are what enable you to continue to bring us these glorious games for free. I get it. And yet... They are excessive. What good are adds when a person such as myself deletes your game... Because the adds are excessive?",
            "This game is super fun. There aren't many ads which is awesome. The game has simple words and it doesn't show the stick figure escaping which is not really fun. But other than that, it is a fun game.",
            "This app is one of the best apps I've used so on. This is a perfect game/app for learning and having fun. Not only me myself, but my whole family enjoyed the game. Only for this app, we had a great time all along. The little cut scenes are just so fun and mind blowing. Who says what about this, in my opinion, it's one of the best apps all around."

There were also some hairstyles that were removed, the short straight black and the short curled black hair, those were my favs, why'd you remove that. Also whenever I play the style challenge, the things that I already bought before have no mark if it's right for the event or not.",
            "Nice game but you get very limited options to choose from. To get more, either you buy the dresses and stuff which is quite expensive OR wactch ads. The issue is when you watch videos to earn coins the game crashes at the end of the video and you loose rewards. It happened multiple times..looks like I'm being foolish just watching ads and wasting my precious time.",
            "This is a great game it's just the new update is very weird. The update changed most of my clothes out with new ones and it doesn't tell you that this item isn't for the theme, which I dont like. Other then that it's a fabulous game and has given me a better sense of style.",
            "I love this game 100% the graphics are great and the outfits are fire🔥, BUT the problem I got is that if u don't pick what the game gives u to wear u don't get 10 out a 10 and the cost for some things are too high I would love if u could fix that.",
            "I really like the game. The biggest bummer of this app is while your progress is saved. Your wardrobe and money are not saved. So you loose all of it if you change phone or want to play in a different device. I hope it gets fixed."

            "I'm sorry. I really do want to give it 5 stars, but I can't. The reason why is because it's choppy. While running I can barely get around because it's really choppy. I have to walk everywhere. Not to mention the movement is a little odd and the stile. Well the stile is fine. But the other things I can't play with those.",
            "it was fun but there was a bug to this game it froze and takes so long to lvl up and it's lagging and too many ads but the only thing to take away the ads is you have to purchase and the only mode that helps you lvl up faster is offline not online because if someone on the online kill an enemy they only get food not you disappointeding my lvl is 6",
            "It is a good game; however I bought tbe Forest and Island and I keep trying to download it, but it says \"Can't download check your internet connection and free up some space.\" Both my connection and space are perfect fine so for tjis issues it's three stars. Plus cub(s) statistics go down away to quickly.",
            "I really like this game I accidentally deleted it and I was so mad actually really liked it so this is why I gave it a 5-star cos it's really good you can have like little carb but then when you have to let you know it's very sad and I like like yeah if it's a boy you have to let it go but I keep it safe email with you didn't because he was just saying the pride anyway but it's really good"

            "This game is a very good game but some changes you have to make in the game. 1) I want you to give more routes to drive. like school, college, hospital. 2) I want you to change the sound of horn and siren. 3) I want you to give the mechanical shop along with fuel station to repair the vehicle. 4) I want you to stop more fire engine trucks in the depot which in the picture. 5) I want you to give the start,stop option like which you give in the 2 bus games. please fix all my needs.",
            "I love the game can you make it were you have a crew and make it where you can color your fire suit and get new patterns and Helmets and you know the classic one with the black stripe i have some new ones for the classic one 1: red stripe with paramedic logo 2: black stripe with black roof and paramedic logo 3: white stripe with white roof and paramedic logo I love the game keep up the good work =)",
            "Awesome game. I think the developers are flat earth believers. Try going into the river and drive to the right. The truck goes upto a 1000 kmph. Looks really fun but you end up losing $200 game currency as the fuel runs out. 😂",
            "Great game, well payed in the game currency, but you need the street lights on the opposing side of the street, and an american map, and it would be nice to have different sirens, and to have a red and white lights, with a fire dept. Symbol you can edit please.",
            "Really good game, but I think it could be better if it had a few different scenarios instead of the same options on the GPS buttons but they should have different countries where you can see and use"

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

I've rebooted my phone, I've cleared my cache, I've turned off my VPN, I've cleared my junk files and my residual files with Norton Clean, and I've deleted the game and reloaded it, NOTHING WORKS.",
            "At first it was okay, $4.99 packs then $19.99 packs to help you advance, now mostly everything is $100 packs. I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. 👎",
            "Have played this game for a number of years getting very discouraged game will load for a day then close spontaneously during the loading process. They tell me its my phone but when others have the same issue. I'm seeing they only want money not fix the issues I'm down grading my stars to a 2 because of technical issues without fixes and it has evolved to a pay to play, pay to win game.",
            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",
            "I played this game all the time on my samsung phones. Very fun game to keep up with. Now I'm on my oneplus 7 pro and nothing loads other than the all text boxes and buildings. I can't transfer my account because I don't know what I'm pressing. This is one of few games I have spent money on, I'd like to not lose that account."

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

Just plain crappy junk. Not worth it!",

I am very nervous and wondering. What did I get my self into?",

This phone was a waist on money just like all the Samsung products I have bought. I am in the hospital and need a phone.",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",

I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",

Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list.

Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",
            "I will say it is good app for those who really want to become cardiologist. I am intrested in these types of activities. I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",
            "The first sentence in the dialog has a typo. Decided to overlook it. It seems the dialog is very poor and controls aren't any better.",
            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

            "Quality just keeps going downhill. Seems like bugs get bigger with each update. Lately, when trying to locate another phone on our plan, it can only tell me the county that the phone is in - which is absolutely useless information. Other times, it can't locate the phone at all. AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",
            "App wont open, keep getting notifications saying the app is updating...been doing this for 3 days..why is it updating for 3 days....not able to use it at all. This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",
            "This app is terrible. Att Smart Limits was a much better app. Each time I unpause my sons internet access, he has to restart his phone for it allow him internet. Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

Can't install the companion on your watch as the play store won't allow repurchase and gives no option to just install... Am at the point where I hope google does get split up by the US senate... Maybe then we will get some competition and decent freaking applications with support!! Google currently SUCKS!",
            "I have tried to connect my Oppo watch. Application freezes at 8-10% I have tried previous versions, nothing... Tried other devices the same... Disappointing. Now I must wait for Google to fix this so I can use my smartwatch.... Till then I can admire it in its box. I was a huge fan of wear os... From now on.... NEVER AGAIN :) :)",
            "Functional but I do feel it's gone backwards. I don't even have the option to show battery levels now. Must be something wrong in the licensing agreements as less and less people despite this being the future of tech seem to be using. Mobile and search being Googles main stay. Feels the same for Home platforms. I'm a Google fan but watch out for the monster that ate blackberry",
            "I recently updated this app, and none of my notifications pop up anymore! They don't even notify me until I have to open up my phone again, is there anyway possible ya'll can fix this?",
            "Ever since I update the application, I can't even receive any notifications (whatsapp, IG, Facebook, email etc). I have tried restarting my Oppo Watch four times and and my phone three times but to no avail. I don't want to do a factory reset my watch since I dont want to lose my data and especially since I can't guarantee it will works as usual. And please dont tell me to inform this on your Wear Os Community because I did emailed to you yesterday and I haven't receive any feedback from you."

            "I like it and had fun but it made me install one more app and there are adds. I only have one game without adds and I think they should have less adds although it is a fun game over all. I definitely think kids of all ages should play this game. This is an honest review and I really hope doing this helped you. Have a great day. Happy Halloween.",
            "Because you get adverts every 2 seconds and there's men naked and my child is playing this and she says Mummy doesn't need it now and I'm like and it's just it's just complicated and basically I don't get why anyone ever would up like this game and it would know why I rated it 2 stars 0 stars is this game keep carrying on I will I will lose my mind and it will not be or I will never do I will I will like girls go crazy and it will not know for every bone in my body is telling me to let go",
            "A small in game fit in a Bunch of Ads.. TOO MANY ADS It is one of the most pathetic games i might have played. Each level is barely 10 seconds but after each level, there's a 30 seconds ad. And every other thing is just so poorly designed, there's no good gameplay.. there's no good game either.. it's just a few unconnected levels fit around many, many ads",
            "Well I was playing the game and there were so many ads and there 30 seconds ads😠. Then I played it again and it keep on glitching for me I really don't think you should play this game cause it is really annoying 😠. but if you wanna play it play at ur own risk. But if none of this happens to you then your lucky."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

        "comments": [
            "Most questions good but not too difficult. Two annoyances are: Mini games between levels. Why? They are irrelevant to trivia. The second annoyance is that some of the tiles you are required to play are not trivia, but are simply games of chance. \"Click the chest to get more coins!\" But if you guess wrong, you lose a life...lose too many lives and the game shuts you down. This is super lame.",
            "Very entertaining. Even learning some new things so makes it worth it. Love how you have control over how hard you want the levels to be. That way its not too easy or too hard. Because when there's no level in between i usually just delete the app. It's the perfect game for me before bedtime, its the only game i've found that relaxes me and calms my brain so i can rest and my brain actually shuts off because it's tired. So yes i give 5🌟s thank you for the upload. I'll be keeping this one.",
            "I freaking love it. A bit heavy on the ads but hey, it's free. You can at least watch an ad to get another life once you run out. I don't mind dropping a little $ once I've thoroughly researched an app. Runs smooth other than ads but it's great you're not immediately forced to pay for upgrades before really getting a chance to see if it's really an app for you. Very enjoyable!!",
            "Without doubt the best quiz app out there. I have had some problems with it freezing, I managed to get to level 540 and it would not go any further no matter what I did so I have had to start again from scratch. I've now managed over 100 levels and it's only crashed once so fingers crossed I'll keep my score and history without having to start again.",
            "As games go; this one is pretty good! You only have to watch ads when you get an answer wrong. I am on level 55. Each level has approximately 15+20 questions. You have little mini-games some times. If you win those you are asked if you want to double your score by watching an ad. When you answer a question, right or wrong, it gives an explanation to the question. So you can learn something. It is a little like the original board game of Trivia Pursuit. I think it's a good game."

Like if your like me, you don't mind the ads, but my problem is that I heal the same patients over and again when I come back into the game. But good game overall. I really like your game Pepi Wonder World.",

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

It's easy to use and the in-page seach function is particularly useful, as well as the quick introduction pieces you would normally only be able to access by hovering over a link on a PC or laptop.

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

            "You'll hear this a lot. Game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ready to spend time to build your own little city you can do it without any diamonds, premium currency. Community is really helpful and good guild can make all the difference for one to stick with the game. It can be played on both mobile and browser, which is great because as city grows more time is needed to get it to run optimally.",
            "Unbalanced game play, players with much a bought stronger army can attack and plunder your items, super slow game play unless you're a pay player, I've been stuck for sometimes a week or more trying gain or trade for items to advance research, like I stated before if you throw real money at the game you can buy your way to the top a thousand times faster.",
            "Great game! If you're looking to \"beat\" a game, this isn't it. It's a slow roll, even slower if you don't purchase diamonds. The game play is good, and even at a slow pace, I'm entertained. I do have a suggestion though.. I'd like to be able to sell my buildings to other users, especially in my guild. If I could get forge points, goods, etc instead of auction $, the game would be even more interesting.",
            "Great game. However, a couple of suggestions 1. Please add a currently online/offline feature for players to see. Doesnt have to be seen by everyone, maybe just by friends and guild mates. 2. Please add in a last online feature for friends and guild mates to see. It is very hard to manage friends and guild list when you have no idea who are active and inactive players. 3. I find this game compared to most hardly gives out the in game currency(diamonds). Maybe try handing slightly more to players",
            "The game is so bugged I can't even start playing it right, but also I have it's a pay to play game . I've put my 10$ in this game to see if it's worth it, but honestly didn't even reach the point where I use them cause game won't load event or story and so on.... In short- no."

            "This would be a pretty good clone of the warioware games, but there were two issues that I had with the game. First, the solution for some of the minigames aren't clear. I had trouble understanding what you were supposed to do in some of the minigames. Second, Your not given enough time to figure out each minigame. Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",
            "I don't like the game,because it asks the same questions. When you do something wrong you lose points. So I prefer you should not down load this game. It is boring to I got to say. No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!😡",
            "I love this game so much, I grew up playing this, so this is kinda a big think to me. I don't mind the ads at all! But that's in my opinion. I love the minigames and the characters so much, this game just makes me happy :)",
            "I adore this game, I just wish that there was an option to turn off the tilting games. As someone with shaking hands (and mine are far from the worst) I always end up dying in these rounds, and it ruins the gameplay.",
            "This app was a little bit of a disappointment to me. The app is very glitchy and I try and click things bit it just won't work. Some of the levels are hard to a aggravating way. I am definitely deleting this app. And I do not recommend this to anyone."

            "The game is fun and addicting, I just wish the choices didn't cost so much, I realize money has to be made, but it would be nice if there was an option to get more than 10 a day for a VIP pass. UPDATE: I still enjoy the game, however it would be nice if once you played through a story, you didn't have to use tickets to go through it again or use more gems to get hairstyles or clothes or pick choices you already made.",
            "I liked the stories but it gets expensive very quickly (I could buy several books with the costs) and you can't change the gender of your character. It was set to female and that was my only choice. The ad I clicked on showed a gay storyline but none of the story choices were that type. I'm a little confused. I also purchased the vip package but saw no benefit from it. Not really sure what I paid for. Still spent a ton on gems, had to buy outfits, hairstyles, experiences, and keys.",
            "Now don't get me wrong the storylines are awesome,they're steamyinteractive but the price of the gems are ridiculous! Now I've downloaded this game I've given it at least a week before I made a judgment on it to actually post a review but it's ridiculous the amount of money that needs to be spent in order to have a good choice or a good ending........ So it keeps the reader interested, it is too much money I understand that you guys need money to keep the game running but it shouldn't be THIS",
            "I love the storyline but like others have said, it's hard to get diamonds. It gives you options but you can't afford the premium options. I think you should be awarded more than 1 diamond for reading a 10-15 minute story. I would love to finish but I'm afraid I may have to uninstall this because at the rate I'm going, I will not get finished. Plus when you click to try to speed up or add diamonds, the game locks up and you lose where you were and you don't get rewarded.",
            "So far I love this app but gems are very useful and I have barely enough for anything. And the fact that you have to buy clothes that you already have. So gems need a big upgrade like come on it really needs it. I love the story that I am in and I think that's it the best but it judges you if your clothes aren't good enough 😕 and some of the best things cost so much gems its unbelievable. So I am on Lessons on Lust or something and I wanted to do the threesome with Gemma but its costs to much."

            "DON'T PLAY, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! It would be a nice game but unless your willing to spend money your not going to get anywhere. Its ridiculously difficult to get any 💎's to move along in the game. I couldn't even get past creating my character because I didn't have enough 💎's. And watching a bunch of ads to try and get gems no thanks.",
            "The app is good for casual play, I usually have a couple of books going at the one time to build up diamonds. The only criticism is things cost too much diamonds and sometimes the videos for free keys and diamonds don't work.",
            "For how expensive this game is, you would think that they would update their stories. It has been two months since some of the stories received a new chapter. Choices are normally 20+ gems EACH and you're not even given that many through the free options they keep mentioning. It will take days to reach that amount using the free gem options. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. You'll be doing yourself an enormous favor and saving yourself a load of disappointment, frustration and regret.",
            "Fun game, but it's completely ridiculous just how expensive it is. You need a TON of diamonds to play, and there is no way of collecting nearly enough for free. You need to buy and even with that, they go so quickly it's not worth it. It's not a choice game when there are 2 options and the one you want costs you at least 20 diamonds, almost every single time. Clothing changes also cost 20 to 25 diamonds. I would be willing to pay a reasonable monthly unlimited amount to play, but this is insane.",

            "This used to be a decent feature of pixels but now it is so convoluted that it's just a nuisance. It doesn't recognize my voice EVER, not even if I prompt it by swiping. Sometimes it pops up randomly when I'm driving and then it still gets nothing. Microphone issue? Doubtful. Also when it pops up on the bottom it covers the keyboard lol great! The list of negatives goes on and on. Why do I need to \"train\" my google assistant every 2 weeks when it's constantly listening to me anyway? Garbage app.",
            "It's an amazing thing; to have this kind of technology readily available at all times, on a personalized level, and small enough to fit in your pocket... for free. However, Google Now was far superior in functionality. Not sure why the step backwards in this seemingly mandatory \"upgrade\", but regardless, it's pretty amazing. I use \"Ok, Google\" probably 10-15 times a day for all sorts of things. It can even answer some two-part questions, and handles most tasks without the need to intervene.",
            "Yes I have numerous suggestions: 1) is for it to read what I ask it to specifically any text message, new or old. 2). If I'm driving down the road and I ask it to tell me something or read the entire paragraph or whatever I don't want it to stop I wanted to recognize that I'm driving and it needs to tell me that it ignores what I'm asking. 3). It would be nice to refine searches previous ones and edit them. 4). More interactive follow-on conversation option. 5,). Able to diagnose, troubleshoot",
            "This used to be a great app but just recently it stopped working at very random times. For example if I ask \"Show me a picture of Mark Hamill\" it will respond with \"Sorry. I don't understand.\" Also, I use the voice feature all the time and the app has stopped hearing my voice (not all the time but again very randomly). Since I use the app frequently, this has become really annoying. At this point, it's about 50% unusable right now, so if you could fix these issues it would be great.",
            "I'm not entirely sure what's wrong but I've trained it a couple times and it still doesn't respond to me but if I use voice search and Google reads a paragraph to me from the web and it happens to have \"OK Google\" or \"hey Google\" in it, it responds. my voice does not at all sound like the default voice that it uses to read, but it still responds regardless. that's the only time I can get it to respond usually."

            "I love this game so much! I only had it for a week and its already my favorite. I have a couple of things that could be fixed though. Usually when I get a friend and I check my friends list they are not there which can be annoying. Sometimes when you try to load into a multiplayer game the map randomly isn´t downlaoded and it kicks you out of the game which is annoying too. It would be really cool if there was a friend and clan chat when your not in game. But overall this is amazing. 5 stars.",
            "Very amazing game. This game is very simple. You basically hunt animals and eat them to level up (if your sensitive to blood there's none in this game). You can even raise a cute family! [Maximum family members is 6). You can also change your animal, and it won't loose your progress! You can change it to a fox, bear, cheetah, crocodile, etc! HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃!",
            "I love this game but could you help me get on multiplayer because when I go on multiplayer it kicks me out and says Error connection to server timed out and that happened for 2 years! And it happened for no reason. I could not fix it! And it's still happening! Has that ever happened to you? And when 1 day passes I can go on multiplayer but if I exit and try going back it does the same as I told you at the second sentence.",
            "It's hard to control the eagle with flying, otherwise the controls are pretty darn good. Though I do know my phone is somewhat small and it's hard to simulate flight. I do think they should (if possible) add more plant variation like with bushes in certain maps. Maybe an aquatic update too? As someone who used to play when there was 3 play able animals, it's awesome to see this game grow! Sorry if I set my expectations too high or low, I just want to see the game improve for everyone.",
            "I love it, it is such a great game I have so much playing with outher players and by my self. But, there is some lag if you go on top of the land a little bit behind the poltel you can go throught that bit of land, be stuck there and have to tellport to your den. Beside that it is a great game. (In the clacis one.)"

            "This app does not work. I called AT&T three times and it still not working. Keep getting the same error message \" The system is currenrly unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

            "The game is good and you get lots of updates every week but You can't grow up without paying thousands in this game . The strong players always attack the weakest player, there are already enough strong player in every city so there is no chance to grow up free or with small amount of money. I am playing this game more than 6 months and without paying i can't grow up. Don't waste your money. This games is only for those who can invest thousands of €€€€$$$$",
            "I liked the game at first, but I started having a bug in my game that hinders me from playing. I have invested alot in this game, and I thought it was going to be great. Instead, I have not heard a response from the company to help resolve my issue. I tried contacting through the game, email, Facebook, and even called a phone number that is disconnected. BEWARE DO NOT SPEND MONEY, BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET HELP IF YOU CAN'T PLAY BECAUSE OF A GLITCH!!!!!",
            "I really like this game. But there are more problems. people are seen able to attack people and their truce don't expire. With every update, the game lags, then freezes before minimizing itself now. And 99% of the personal event rewards are not worth doing! Fragments are a joke when won. Especially for the yellow ones. And the buyable packs need a lot more in them to be worth their amount. City Chat is still not monitored! Do something!!!!",
            "I have played games similar to this but i gotta say i like the mafia thing. The game is fun by itself with the story line and evrything. But it is a little more fun when other people participate in the clan. But it defitately keeps my mind busy when its trying to run wild. Love the game though, lots of rewards also!",
            "I just installed the game maybe half hour ago, after 4 \"error\" during the install. Middle of playing (still tutorial part) it randomly stopped and pops up that it was updating at stuck at 40% for 10 mins. Closed it, assuming my phone was being dumb and now i have not been able to get back in the game. I get a black screen that keeps minimizing and refuses to play :( i have family who play the game so was really hoping to play, but this much bs already is not comforting start!"

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

A really nice app and I recommend this for every student. If u feel like a lot of ads are disturbing you, you can just switch off the internet connection. Works with my phone, not sure if it works with yours.🤔",

Speaking of adds, i don't have problem with it. Speaking of 'tricks' I already mastered some of those and can actually solve mentally. Ps: I just used it for one day. How much more If i use this for so long? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP. For developer of this app. I want you all to congratulate for this masterpiece. Gb",

This is really an app I'll recommend if you want to improve your marks in mathematics and take it into a whole new level! The best part about it is that it is free! Hats off to the developer for creating this wonderful app. 😄😄😄",

            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

            "Cute game, but I love these kinds of logic puzzles and totally BLEW through the provided content and now can only replay old levels, repeatedly. Promises of weekly adds for new levels have not been upheld, with spotty updates. I wouldn't be mad, but why have the new content promise if you are just going to break it? Personally, I find that to be bad form. Two options, both are equally valid: keep to new weekly content, or take down the claim.",
            "Con: There are a TON of ads. Like, after almost every level. A lot. Pro: The ads are only 5 seconds or so long. Con: It says they add new levels weekly, but they haven't added any in over a month. And when they do you can complete them in 10 minutes. Pro: It's re-playable. I've gone through the levels several times. Con: There is no need to ever watch an ad to get extra coins. The coins serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever. If stars were thumbs I'd give it four thumbs up.",
            "If you're looking for a \"pull the pin\" game that all these developers are advertising their game as, this is it. The game is a fun time waster but it's not a money waster (supported through ads which you can remove for 3$). Thank you for actually giving us what you advertised, I've been so let down by ads that show such a cool concept but do not use that concept in any way.",
            "On the surface, Hero Rescue is a buggy, mediocre time waster. But somehow, I just can't put it down. This game has all the marks of \"low effort mobile game full of ads,\" but it somehow carries a love for its players that's surprising to find outside of most console games. The game gets constant content updates. The game upholds its own simplicity and does a good job introducing its mechanics without tutorials and words. Don't get me wrong, this game sucks. But it's a nice lesson in game design.",
            "This is a great game. I think it's just the style or idea of this game that's so fun, not the execution. There is a tad to many ads and the iq mechanic is definitely inaccurate and is probably there just to keep people playing. Also most of these 5 star reviews don't seem like actual human beings."

            "Great game, its a good way to pass the time. Bit difficult to grasp what to do in the beginning but once you get the hang of it then its great fun. 30/10/2020 Um.... what happened guys? This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

            "Almost unusable. My subscriptions expired, but I never received an email informing me about that. When I ran the app it never notified me about expired subscriptions. When I tried to open a magazine, it simply wouldn't open - no error message, just eternal spinning waiting icons. I only realized what the problem was when I was able to open older issues but not newer ones. I tried to purchase a new subscription, but wasn't able to find any way to accomplish the task - I could only find an option to buy an individual issue, which was NOT what I wanted. I've had it with this really crappy app. I'm switching to Readly.",
            "I have been using Zinio for quite awhile now. Magazines downloads are high quality. No problem there. The reason I am leaving Zinio is the constant barrage of offers and sales notifications. If you want to be notified when a magazine is ready for download you also get their marketing notifications. It's constant and there is no way to opt out from them.",
            "Just like everyone else, cannot log in after a factory reset, says a unexpected error has occured and check conection when conection is 100% ok. Also need the ability to store magazines on sd card as this app eventually will fill internal memory so you have to ditch previous magazines that you have paid for to read new editions. Just not good enough. The app also says that if i log out all previous magazines will be lost, WHY? We need to have the choice to SAVE with the option to save as a pdf",
            "I can redo the review as Zinio did sort out a problem that meant I could not get recent editions like several other reviewers. Unexpected error try again, network. All reviewers got the same cut & paste answer After uninstalling and re- installing 3 times over several days it finally worked again. Seeing the app version numbers my suspicion is a faulty update caused the problems. The last re install had a different app revision. Zinio could have been more upfront if this was the problem."

I like that I don't have to listen to every single message. I can visually see who the message is from. I like being able to erase certain messages without having to listen to them every time. This could be a great app if you would FIX the problems. Seems like everyone has the same issues. I've been with metro for about 10yrs.",
            "Keeps sending me messages that say the app is \"running\" and the app will not synchronize properly. VERY ANNOYING. Metropcs can't figure it out. Tried getting them to fix the problem three times but they don't know how to do it!!! Will probably have to uninstall the app, lose all of my archived messages and pic's and reinstall to see what happens. Also, NEVER set your permissions to ALL! Doing so will let messenger change your contact list, phone call information, distributes private info also!!",

Now i tried getting on the app on my phone but after setting my new passcode per the apps request , and using my phones last 4 numbers like suggested by app! Then it wouldnt accept the phones numbers, i have to call my phone to get into my VM\"s so the app really is worthless! Lets jooe it has been fixed or im dropping it!",

            "I get sick of trying to explain this to game manufacturers, but 30 sec ads are a thing of the past. All you get is people uninstalling your game and complaining about the ads. Now a game with 5 or 10 second ads will get played and you will subject the player to a lot more ad time. How can you be smart enough to write a game but not be able to figure that out? Uninstalled.",
            "MORE ADS, LESS PLAY This is a pretty fun game but it's sadly riddles with ads. If you skip an ad for a reward, you're met with an ad anyways. That's cheap. Don't be cheap. I would love to see your company implement higher ethical standards when it comes to things like how often you subject your potential buying customers with ads. Right now it's about 10 seconds of game play VS. 120 seconds of ads. If you treat ppl better, they're more inclined to micro pay",
            "Pretty entertaining. However, the ads are excessive and what really irritated me was the coin math wasn't correct. If you watched an ad for a certain amount of coins, you did not receive that amount of coins. It was way less, sometimes a few thousand less. Something that basic shouldn't be wrong in a game. Very irritating.",
            "I wish I could give this a 3.5. Sounds are great, game play is fun, coins are useful and there's always a fun little \"3x coins! Watch this ad!\" Ads aren't a huge issue since you can turn your wifi and data off. I believe more detail on uniqueness should've been done, and more add-ons like bombs, or something that you get further on other than skins that makes the game continually fun. All in all, game is a fun time waster :)",
            "I like the game, pretty nice here, you get more people, fight other armies and bosses. And that is it. But the reason I gave 3 stars, Because 2 reasons. 1: The ads here are terrible. You just keep getting ads everytime you complete a level. 2: There is this weird bug where when I go to next level, this black screen kinda looking things keeps appearing and disappearing on my screen, and whenever that happens, it ruins my advantage of winning. Please fix this annoying glitch, Devs."

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

After an hour of chat they said they would forward my case to a manager who would email me. NOT the experience I would expect. NOT the experience I thought I paid for. Google LLC: I have. The runaround is appalling. In fact, I've been trying for over a year... 😔",
            "Google one vpn? Added to my quick settings too soon I guess because it leads nowhere and does not activated a vpn. Also The top comment where the guy talks about google and the chat support during pandemic and always you are talking to people who don't understand anything beyond the view in front of them with not flags on your account...and seriously it's for Google Pay for me too not even google one. But I've had to use both and google one customer service over the phone was almost as bad.",
            "I have been a paid member since 2018 and had somewhere close to 265Gb of music, pictures and videos lost recently. I have not changed any storage locations or folders, just vanished. I had the 2T at $9.99 a month, which I wasnt using, and have nothing to show for it after about 20 years of media lost. Im ending my service today. Update: my bad, I was wrong. 😂 I called and a tech found and copied all my files over.",
            "App states advice from a Google expert 24/7. I always leave feedback and am kind to the operators. They often have no idea what I'm talking about or how to help. I'm usually transferred numerous times, which we're all used to on support lines and especially in a pandemic. I find it disappointing. for example I will select my issue is about Google pay which you can select as an option and the support agent will say you have come through to Google one support and this is not related to the app.",
            "I like it but I don't like it. I like that I get more room to store my photos, docs, videos, and etc. It's very entuitive and easy to use. I don't like it because it doesn't back everything up the way it says it's going to do. Backing up my multimedia messages is harder then it needs to be. It's always giving errors and just doesn't do the job correctly."

            "Directional pad isn't very good. Try to move straight forward and can only go slightly left or right of straight, so I just move forward in a bit of a zig zag motion. Got to the first big enemy and hit it once. After that, I could not move (directional pad disappeared completely), nor could I attack. I just stood there while the ogre attacked me repeatedly. Reloaded 5 times with the same result. Too bad, it looks like a pretty good game.",
            "Linear, not open. Colorful, but no real decision making. Couldn't even start the tutorial without encountering begging ads. Pretty lousy intro to a game, but typical of low quality, greedy game makers. Especially ones from China or non US game makers. This game is Korean, so all glitz, nothing original or deep. As we all expect I recieved the standard, insincere, automated reply from the game developer. It always the lie that shows the greed which dominates the gaming business.",
            "Went here to tell something. I did enjoy this game BUT I have this very annoying scenario when i get to duel or team pvp with players who are high ranked per se and it really sucks because it tends me, my character to lag or freeze or *my connection's poor or whatever even though I got a good internet service. Can we do something about that? I don't have other problems encountered with the game other than that.",
            "Gameplay is excellent and customisation options are great. Only one thing mars the whole experience, and that is the constant begging to spend money, the same offer came up 8 times in the space of three minutes. Surely the programming can be changed so it realises that once you have rejected an offer, you don't want it. IF I decide to keep playing I may decide to take up on some offers, but until then I cannot in good conscience give this more than a 3 star review.",
            "This game is good, but there are major problems. 1) Most PVP is pay to win I say most because if you manage properly you don't have to buy anything. But it really comes down to who is willing to buy more. They do try and counter this by giving beginners chances to get S rank gear. But fighting in campaign with S rank gear becomes a chore when clearing stages instead of fun and challenging. 2) Their team matching system is pretty wack. High lvs get put with low lvs which causes imbalance."

            "I love this app . And it has no ads. U can do anything u want. This is the best thing. This is the best colour app . All apps have ads . But this isn't . So I am so happy . ❤❤ . And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "It has been good so far. It is unobtrusive and has provided interesting news items. It is not 5 stars yet (or possibly less) because I have not used it often enough to form an opinion on if the news is biased or not. Update.:. I am liking this app alot. I find myself checking it at least once a day without fail. I like that it sometimes asks if a particular news item is appreciated (hopefully getting a better understanding of what I like)",
            "They've really put a lot of work into the interface and quality of the app which, to be honest, wasn't very good in the past. It seems much more deliberate and with a much greater investment of thought in how it attempts to deliver the news in a \"context\" relavant format, as opposed to how it once felt as if Google was treating it as an afterthought just to have a cursory presence in newsreader apps. Much, much better, I o.",
            "It's pretty good, especially for searching historical articles and emerging trends, but for day to day, you have to be very careful with your curation, it is very easy to create an echo chamber of the same articles, for days, to the exclusion of new things you would want to see. And, on the flip side, not curating your tastes results in only top headline pop culture garbage. Oh, and if you use a browser other than chrome, it gets flaky. I'm looking for something less finicky and more robust.",
            "Not working well in split-screen mode (Tab S7+). With 2 side-by-side apps, opening some articles has the layout configured for the full screen width of the tablet, rather than the width of the split-screen window. Makes it difficult to read, having to scroll both left-to-right on each line. I will revise my review when this issue is fixed.",
            "It's a good news app, it's doesn't have all variety of newspapers all over world ofcourse but it do have popular newspapers. The video quality is good, keeps you up to date in whatever field you want. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars cause it doesn't support \"e - newspapers\". I love e - newspapers a lot and they don't have that feature. Looking for this feature in future updates."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying.

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

Took random photos, gave me loads of images from Google, Pinterest and any other places a similar photo was on the internet. Gave me explanations of the images. So far so good... Also read out any words it may have seen in the photo. I'd of give it 5 stars. But haven't been using long enough to do so. But liking it so far. Will edit if need be.",
            "Love, love this app!! I work for a non-profit thrift store and I constantly have to look up the value of items. Sometimes the search is off...usually, due to lighting, etc.. Most of the time the item I have taken a photo of is on the first few search page results. Regardless, it is my go to app for items I am unfamiliar with, that lack a upc. Most, if not all of my co-workers are Apple users. When they need help looking up an item, I cheerfully remind them that Apple products are inferior!🤣",

I can't even open the app. It just says thank you for updating . Please try later. I try to uninstall the update, again updated again but nothing really works . Requesting the technical team please help to resolve this issue",
            "I can't search Google by images anymore thanks to this app being integrated with chrome.. So now I can't search by images or find images of other sizes or even fact check websites that are using fake photos. Google's greatest feature besides the collaboration of the entire internet on one search hub was the ability to search the entire internet via one photo. Now thanks to google lens you can't; I'm not sure how this is progress but I definitely wouldn't call it that. Fix this.",
            "It is a great app. Google is always the first to develop such mind-blowing apps. About 5-6 years ago I thought that just as we can search anything on google, there should be a feature that allows us to search not by typing, but by scanning an image because there are many different animals and plants that we don't know about. But i thought that was impossible but nothing is impossible to google. Keep developing such impossible technologies, google. Great app."

            "Sorry folks,got to down grade my review. First: New players don't fall into the Facebook trap it's more trouble than it's worth. Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",
            "Was running fine & progressing nicely until it tried to force me to accept a Facebook policy, I cannot accept the cookies as screen won't drag to press accept as screen size has changed, so it means I'm no longer able to send help/ items to friends or ask for help with reports at the end of each case, also feeding pets has changed to adverts only which now takes forever....really disappointed & frustrated so please change it back to 5 min timers & cut the excessive adverts for everything"

            "This is a cute game, but there are WAAAAAY too many ads! I don't need them forced on me in such an aggressive manner. Everything you do is another ad. Update: I bought the full version advertised, \"ad free\" of the game and you STILL are forced to watch ads. I immediately went for a refund and there wasn't an option. Do NOT let these people steal your money! THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM!",
            "Love the game. Although it has way to many ads, after every round there is a ad. I hate this so I'm giving it 4 stars. Please fix this, and I might come back and change my answer. Besides all the ads this Is a great game so I recommend anyone that likes tricky games and dosent mind lots of ads this game Is for you. But again please fix the ad problem it is getting on my nerves! But I will not delete this app. Thank you",
            "The ads are manageable if you keep your wifi off, and the graphics are cute. The biggest problem is that it just becomes tedious after a while. 2 choices for every level, sometimes logical and sometimes meant to be funny ... but it jusst gets boring really fast.",
            "I uninstalled immediately. After literally 3 seconds of playing a portion of the game, there are two ads: one of which you need to wait 5 seconds to skip, and the other is a full 30 seconds, all after 3 seconds of game play!! Absolutely obnoxious. And then it repeats.",
            "Clicked on only 2 things in the game and was hit with 5 full length adverts. This is just advert city. You have no time to enjoy the game, its just random tap and boom you're bombarded with adverts. I get that adverts fund development but there needs to be a trade off. In this case there is almost zero game and just one advertisement after the other. The hubris of calling this a game and then asking you to rate it after only 2 interactions with the game is staggering."

Tools bar is actually the best feature in this app. UI is simple & minimalistic, probably something which everyone would love. Still, I'd expect some customization features like altering grid size. Preview is only monthly view, an option to add day view would be brilliant as well."

        "comments": [
            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "I enjoy the ability to listen to a book as I drive, the only to toddler-free time I have. I love the book exchange, so I can keep the books I truly love. It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "I gave this game 3 stars! I love this game so much but... When I updated the game, all my dolls dissapered! I got really sad and angry. I wish I never updated the game. By the way I have some suggestions that you can add into the game: 1: When you update the game, you don't lose all yours dolls. 2: Add more outfits for the girls. 3: For the black eye color it should be darker. I love this game soo much. Thanks for making this game. I REALLY enjoy it!",
            "I love this game. It helps you be creative and choose who you want to create. People without premium get to have a challange were they get to use items that arent premium. I also love this game because it brought me closer to my friends that don't live near me and they end up installing the app. One thing i would like to add would be like hats or bows so you can have things in your hair without paying for premium. I hope this helps everyone that reads this. Thank you for making this game. 😊",
            "5/5 Stars!! I love this game so much! It's a great way to make avatars and you could even make your self and, try out different looks! There is minimal ads but, there could be a spin wheel that you can watch ads to spin and get like a daily spin to earn coins. You could then use those coins to unlock some of the locked items just for 1 or 2 uses. Mainly because some of the best items are locked and only for premium users. Other than that love this game and 10/10 recommend!!",
            "Very fun, adorable avatars, and I love the hairstyles and the fact you can layer the clothes, only one thing, this is just extra kind of feedback, maybe add a few more things, but overall it is amazing! Also it's not even that, that is the only thing I would say about improving this app! Super fun, and the fact you've included masks is another great feature, and shows your respect and seriousness towards the pandemic. Great job!",
            "This is a really great game. I personally think that you could add a new option for creating dolls (full body option) Aswell as this, you could also add some cool postitions for your doll to pose in, this way when you save your dolls they will be in a cool position and you can also see there legs aswell. Other than this, this is one of my favorite games to play. 👍🏻"

Thank you for staying with us!",

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

This version is so old that there are a number of bugs that mean it's not suitable for new hardware. In the version I have, seeds and fuel never run out. Also, sometimes a section of your field turns a different colour and won't turn back. If GIANTS continue to offer this game for new devices on the app store, they need to clean it up and make it work correctly.",

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

Bring back move minutes as an option when setting your goals.",
            "I bought the oppo watch. I am upset with Google fit on the Wrar OS by Google. Google fit has a lot of issues with background mode. It can lose steps and heart tate. The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",
            "This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",
            "Perfect app tht I use as a widget on my home screen. I religiously update any recordings I take offline and is a kind of my health journal, that I can review and make some assessment. I had seen great pointers that helped me to predict something going wrong and seek timely medical help. I helps you to be more disciplined. I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",
            "I've taken up the Dubai Fitness Challenge this year ( today being the 1st day) and to keep up with the challenge, I use the Fastrack Reflex app to calculate my daily steps while I go for my walks/runs. But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

            "Cool! Now whenever I whistle my phone says \"Come on!\" in the challenging voice of Duke Nukem. Easy setup and it sounds just like the classic video game. (My own sound file). You supply custom sound file. (It comes with six sounds.) I'm gonna get the ad free once I pay a few older bills. *Sigh*. Edit: now I changed it to say \"Gin!\" So I respond with such half-witty repartee as \"at this hour?!\" No, whisky!\" And \"Alright, I'm sending you to Betty Ford\" if it's a song that keeps hitting the note.",
            "It isn't always reliable and you am have to be able to whistle but apart from that it's fine theirs not many ads in the slightest and it makes finding your phone a lot better plus it let's you customize if you want a flash or vibration on your phone when it plays.You can also make turn it off so when your on your phone you can prevent it from going off. So over all it's a 4 star for me",
            "Just downloaded this app, so far its good. My only concern is the option to choose your own sound. It doesn't show all the sounds I have in my device. It only shows the ringtones for google hangouts. Is there something wrong with my phone, or it's the app itself?",
            "Great app. It can hear my whistles from the other room :). However, it reacts to other things too such as squeaky doors, birds singing (NOT whistles), and my dog woofing. I set the tune to meowing so now my phone meows wherever I go lol.",
            "This app is so cool! The only problem is it doesnt work sometime when I whistle. I have an idea for this app just yell what word that you typed in that would be cool! 😅😅"

            "Definitely NOT unlimited. From what I have read the app uses some algra rhythm to determine how many books you can listen to a month. Sometimes I am able to listen to 6, sometimes they cut me off at 4. Very frustrating. They even take the books away if you have downloaded them and make you wait until your next payment goes through. I wish they offered a truly unlimited option for the audio book portion..I would definitely pay more for truly unlimited access",
            "This monthly fee is so worth it....no late fees if you don't read the book fast enough, read without worrying about a due date, read on my phone (super convenient) and about 85% of the books I've searched for I've found (some were even books that people personally uploaded). Lately the app has been buggy. There's an option to categorize your book titles. I would like to eventually see all my titles moved only into that specific list.",
            "Can't say enough good things about this app. For $9.99 a month, I have access to at least 75% of the books I have searched for. (That estimate may be too low,) Some are audio books, some are ebooks. Sometimes I have access to both audio and ebook for the same title. Magazines, articles, and so much more. In the time of Covid, I was waiting 2-3 months for ebooks and audiobooks from my library and spending a fortune for ebooks from that site that starts with an A. SCRIBD IS GREAT.",
            "I am a big book nerd but I hate buying books online (no local bookstore) without getting to look through them. This app solves this issue! Most books I start on here, I end up buying a hard copy of. The subscription fee is totally reasonable especially since they offer lots of audiobooks. After looking into other apps, glad I pick this one.",
            "The app works great. I wish the service would just be upfront that there's a limit on non-librivox audiobooks. When they just throttle searching it makes it look like there catalog is inconsistent, and it's just generally a sneaky way to handle it. I'd much rather know the limit and budget it, just like it is with library based services."

But that one problem isn't going to put me off this game for life like it will with all the other whimps out there. I have had tonns of apps and games with ads, but the only reason I felt like deleting them is to download other more fun and popular games I see thanks to the games with lots of ads. So, ads aren't really that bad after all.",
            "Nice casual game. When I have nothing to do i simply open it and it entertains me. But man by every update they are increasing the difficulty. So i want to tell the developers that this game has an image of refreshing and casual game. So the more difficulties you add the more people will not play it. So better for you guys, Make it more entertaining not difficult.",
            "This is such a relaxing game! The ads aren't so bad, cause well, which game doesn't have ads? The only issue I have with the game is that the sounds play whenever the media volume is raised, and they don't stop despite muting them in the settings bar. That's really annoying tbh, and the only reason why I wouldnt give this 5 stars",
            "It is an amazing and addictive game. Really easy to use and child friendly. There are games in which their ads show that the game is like this and this how to use it but then it is different to use.In this game, it shows the true usage of this and the ad is true. This is the most favourite of all time.😘😘😍😍",

But even when you decline it, when you try to manually upgrade your character, you are given a free upgrade and you can ONLY upgrade if you FORCEFULLY watch an ad.

I'm using the UK version so maybe people will have a better experience in other countries. Update I have logged in several times through the day and all show as sold out. I also do not understand the new piggy bank, how do you collect nuts and bolts?, how do you heist from other players?",
            "It was good. Then it was not so good, introduced piggy bank... A way to spend tokens in hopes of winning more. Prize was tokens and blackjack hands. New piggy is worse.. I don't even get tokens, just get jerked around by the piggy. I know I will never get the last nickel to cash out at$10, doesn't bother me, liked the gift cards. I know I will never get anything from the piggy. I just keep coming back hoping I will get one last gift card. And I cannot find your help center.",
            "Worst app ever!!!. Once you are approaching the minimum withdrawal then they won't give you any cash anymore and, I am just 0.15 away.They just let you watch a lot of advertisements over and over again. I won't recommend this app. Now they have an update to heist from some other players too. Nah it just goes on in circles over and over again.No withdrawal has been made.I have been playing it for a while. Highly won't recommend this app.",
            "Waste of time. Period. Deleting now with no regrets despite being $0.25 away from cashing out (For 1-2weeks of multi-daily check-ins to the app). My gut says I'll never see a dime and my time is better spent elsewhere on games and activities I actually enjoy. Download at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you! Edit: After that response, I'm confident that I'm right. They make vague and empty promises so they can make more money through their scam.",
            "Has been slow for cash payouts but I have gotten a few gift cards.. Now this app sucks. Doesn't pay out. You get enough tokens and all of a sudden its sold out... used to be legit. Beats paying for scratchers but man change the payout system back to what it was a year ago and I will change my rating back to 5 stars. Took a legit app and made it a SCAM or just near damn impossible to get any gift cards. Fun to pass the time but doesn't pay out anymore 🙃"

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",

            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

My phone was fixed in no time, and as a bonus for being a first time user, I got a new charger for almost nothing. I love this app and will be using it much more often",

            "Great game! It's like it's actually reading your mind, sometimes. But the thing is, whenever I keep thinking about rare things, I never get to see if Akinator actually got them. I hate it because I'm not allowed to buy anything either. Stuff like Asta's sword from Black Clover or Sakura from Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun are a few examples, it always says it's rare and I wanna see if Akinator actually got them. At this point it seems like Akinator just wants money. Please remove the rare thing!",
            "I used to like this game. Then they started charging people who didn't want ads. Fine, whatever. But now, I am not allowed to watch an ad, i just don't get to see the answer without purchasing the ad-free version?! This is stupid. One star until you fix this embarrassment of a once-good app. Also, thank you so much for ruining my childhood. I really appreciate it.",
            "I used to love this app, but I have to give it a bad review. The fact that I have to pay to see a rare character, object, etc is just scummy. You can have a long game going, but the second Akinator decides to take you to that screen, and you don't want to pay, your game is just over. The game is damn near unplayable now. If you want more money, just add some more cosmetics.",
            "It really isn't what it used to be. Ads will load when you're trying to do something, but when you actually want him to guess your rare character they just won't, so that's really pouring salt into the wound of already having to watch an ad just to continue with the game.",
            "The fact that I have to pay to see a character that's rare is stupid. I know its gonna be like this forever which is why I'm not gonna play till I dont have to pay. Might As well get rid of it do I dont waste 5 minutes just to be told to pay for a guess. Horrible Horrible move.👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😠"

Edit: the game has never been glitchy, but recently I was playing and suddenly the game got stuck and my phone turned off after that, the music if the game was still playing and my phone wouldn't turn on for a while. The problem is fixed now, but I'm still worried about entering the game. Does the game have a glitch or a virus?",

            "This isn't supposed to be a review of the news itself. The app works well for the most part, but does have bugs loading images and sections when in landscape on my tablet (i.e. it won't load some randomly but does load others). I would also love something like \"Download print issue\" where you could digitally see exactly what the print newspaper looked like that day, which is a feature for some other papers. Overall, it's a good app, but it does need some improvements.",
            "I love the app interface on my cell phone. Home page is basically just stacked articles w/o any real organization, but every article has a byline and they squeeze a lot of pictures and graphics on the homepage. Still, somehow they make it look very clean. It does lead to more scrolling than most other news apps, but I think the trade-off is worthwhile. And content aggregation is quite good. This is definitely my go-to news app, even over multi-source aggregators. What keeps this from being a five-star review is notifications. Frequency and importance are fine, but often when you expand the notifications they will all (or mostly) be duplicates, even when unexpanded they are different articles. Occasionally the notifications will point to different articles. This used to be a much larger issue, while this has been fixed for the most part it still happens on occasion. I'd also like the search to be included on the main page action bar. But if they fix the notification thing I'll update to five stars.",
            "Love the journalists but hate the app. They put up notifications with interesting leads, but when l click on the notice I am sent to an entirely unrelated story. Of course by then the notification that peaked my interest is gone. The only way to find the story is to locate search (which is buried) and then remember some key words from the notification. Washington Post does not have this problem. Why can't the Times get it right?",
            "App performance issues have improved over the last year or so. But is this app actively under development? I don't see many new features. One request: Night mode has to be manually turned on and off. Can this be done automatically, similarly to the Android system feature that can detect when it's nighttime?",
            "Love this app & The N Y Times. Keep it going. The apps are a fantastic addition to newspapers and may be their salvation. We cannot allow the newspaper industry to die. TV is fine but deep insights can only be gained from quality journalism. Were key newspapers to disappear then very soon the quality of TV journalism would plunge and become less than worthless."

            "It's one of the best dress up apps out there, there's plenty of items and (so far) there doesn't seem to be a limit on saved dolls. It would be cool if they added a way to sort your characters into folders of sorts so that it's easier to find a character you're looking for. Edit: After the last update I started getting adds on the top and bottom of my screen again even though I previously paid to remove them. Down to three stars until this is resolved.",
            "Oh my!This game is F.A.B,I just really adore the details!YOUR GRAPHICS ARE REAAAAALLY GOOD👍!!! I hope my reccomendations help!: Pls add the ability to choose earings,neclaces,sleeves,shirts,pants etc. and i hope we can change the colors! I want more eye designs and be able to color them+They can blink! If we could add like animations that make the hair look like its flying by the wind it would be cool! 😮 add poses and i wanna be able to make stories with this app,anything pls! #SORECOMMENDED!",
            "I really enjoy this app! It's fun, creative, and has beautiful music.There are only 2 things it's missing: 1: if you could change the colours on everything (eyes, clothes, shoes ect.) that would be great! 2: it would be fab if you could put your chibi doll in different poses, as I think the regular standing pose is a bit boring.",
            "This game is very fun it is amazing it's a creating a character it's just like God's club but very different than go to club I love it so much I love how you can like change the look of your characters so much but I wish they would add somewhere that you can makeup a name for your character but it is very fun it's a very creative fashionable game well not that fashionable 😂😂😂😂😂 Well download it if you haven't",
            "Great game so awesome game 8 year old girl so good I recommend you make more games like this ... I'm a fan of MLP my little pony .. I made a mlp chibi dolls so great hope you upgrade .. the game ..or make more like this game.. 😀😃👍👍👍👍👍......"

            "Had a problem with subscription features that as far as I know, cleared itself up (no support, clearing the cache didn't work. Did that, uninstalled and reinstalled and ensured I was logged into the correct account. Gave up, came back to the app a day later and was able to use HD features and all filters). It took a little less than support to respond, so that was good considering this is an app where you shouldn't run into many issues. Only issue, reorganizing your filter collection is a pain",
            "Used to be good but the quality fell, the filters aren't as good as they used to be, it is slow, and it suddenly became a subscription thing. There are very few filters, and the advert for the subscription or the free day trial keeps popping up every other moment. The few free filters are low quality and there doesn't appear to be many locked ones, so doesn't seem worth the money. Am very disappointed.",
            "The photo styles are great and I like that there is a choice of SD or HD, and that a variety of settings can be modified with the ease of a slider, however, the styles themselves are limited and there doesn't appear to be a way to include more (either as a freebie or paid). As much as I'm enjoying it, I don't see myself using it even the full year with that limitation. I'm on the fence as to whether it's worth the yearly cost. I have photoshop on my desktop; I'd be better off with that.",
            "amazing array of effects. totally engaging. few options that I wish were there: 1. search or filter effects based on criteria. Considering there are so many effects, searching through them to find the right one is time consuming. I wish they were sorted in categories or even better had a search option with facility t filter search results . 2. compare effects / compare with original option.",
            "Great app only problem is I used to be able to isolate a person and take the filter off only on the person or have the filter only on the person and the everything else normal. I really liked this feature and idk if it got removed or if it was moved and I can't find it."

I haven't got years to dedicate to this game. 30 seconds ads are annoying too. I wanted to enjoy it. Don't want to feel I must spend to proceed. To complete this, you'd be looking at spending either 3 years of your life or over £200.",
            "What I love about this game, is the concept. The concept of this game is fabulous. It is like a time machine which brings us back in time with the primary evolution and the dinosaur tree, and brings us in future when we finally purchase the 'singularity'. I think it is one of the best offline games. It is a dream for the science lovers and the people who aren't interested in science, also become interested due to this game. | Evolution Never Ends |",
            "The game was very interesting in the beginning. Felt the progress system was very good. But later in the game it becomes kind of a grind. I usually play games till I finish whole game. But this one got too boring to max out. It feels like the developers just kept adding levels without content just to make the game longer. The satisfaction of achievement was taken away. Or else I would have rated this game 5 stars.",
            "Very great and fun game. I love how much research you guys also put into it, everything here is true and happening except the fact that it's a simulation. But going into the future with martians and stuff is a great twist. I recommend this game to everyone! One question though when is the beyond update coming out?",
            "Great game...but it's very frustrating that advancement of the main simulation depends on the level of the dinosaur simulation which is ridiculously slow!! They yield way (and I mean WAY) less than they cost!! Having to wait for level 25 in the dinosaur simulation to get further in the main simulation is silly...it means I'm over a week away from getting any further!!"

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

I dont know why this is happening still I close the game 3 or 4 times then it is fixed. I do this like 3 or 4 times daily. But good work in making this game.",
            "Fun game ruined by too ads. 15 second level 45 seconds of ads. The only way to not have ads is a $5.99 so if you play for a year you will spend more than a AAA game and the dev is absolutely ridiculous if they think there game is worth that much.",
            "This game has the potential of being GREAT. Buuuuut, almost every time you tap the screen you are forced to watch an ad. There's an ad for everything you have to do. The abundance of ads needs fixed to a manageable amount. If I continue to see this ridiculous amount of ads I will have no choice but to uninstall the game. The ads take so much away from the game. Otherwise it would be a great game. I would give 5 stars but the ads ruin it. If you fix that I will re rate to 5 stars.",
            "Great fun Fun little game, with actually quite a lot of content for a free game. Lots of game modes Only a few puzzles have really confused me, but yeah. Game game and worth the download. Only issue is adverts after every few levels, so if you are quite good you end up getting an advert every 40 seconds which can be annoying. But game is free. So there you go",
            "I'm not gonna lie... I love this game... It's satisfying... But some of the levels REALLY test my patience... Sometimes I think there's absolutely no way to solve certain levels... It really ticks me off... There's also a lot of ads... But i'm not as bothered by that..."

            "It is a fun game and I enjoy playing. There are a lot of ads and they pop up randomly. The game also glitches and lags alot sometimes so much that I have to exit the app and lose the design, so I have to redo what I just did. This only happens after I have been playing for a little while and it usually glitches because of an ad. I also think that it could be more fun if yiu could design your own stuff and sell it or just to design it, so you can be more creative.",
            "Its an AMAZING game!!! I love it sooooo much. There is one problem. When I had been playing for quite a while I just had to repeat previous shirts, skirts, ect. Other than that its one of the most AWESOME games in the world. I hope you will add some more design's into the game.😘😘😘",
            "I've been playing this game for a long time . I maxed out all my upgrades and unlocked everything . I was playing for over 100 days then all of a sudden it started me again from DAY ONE.. Im super pissed because I never cared about all the stupid ads I just enjoyed the game then after all the time I've spent into this game for it to restart me to day one is a smack in the face...I will most likely be deleteing the app...VERY disappointing.",
            "Fun but needs more options. It would be great if you could make your own designs and have them for sale on the side, either auction style or in the shop. Also the way the ads are set up is not ideal for offline users. Unfair you can only get new things if you watch ads.",
            "This tie die game is so cool because like you just can do it like anything you want you have to make you close and everyone so cool like you can see all these world's there picture you have t-shirt pants skirts and all the people out there I think you should play this game is absolutely amazing OK bye see you guys later thank you for making this game I can wait to do it again😍😍😍"

            "What a miserable \"game\". The devs trap you into turning WiFi on to progress to the next level so I just turned it on, pressed the button and turned it off as soon as I was in the level. Which may I add are pathetically easy. This is the bare bones minimum for a game, and I took joy out of every penny I did not give the greedy bastards who made this loathsome pile of garbage.",
            "Scam. As mentioned in other reviews, unplayable because of the insane number of ad pop-ups. So, I go to the Home screen and find an option for \"ad-free\" for $2.99. Ok, I bite.... It's less than a cup of coffee. Am I add-free? Not even close! But got another purchase option 'bundle' for $4.99 to go add-free. Thought that was what I just paid for! No option to give this a negative star rating.",
            "I like that you had the good sense to create the game that everyone else has falsely advertised for. It is very fun and engaging. I like the puzzles and the story line that comes with them. However, the amount of ads is excessive. I'm on the 20th-ish level but I've seen like 35 ads between level 1 and 20. I also noticed that if the storyline cutscenes are too long, my screen cuts out. I think if you fix those 2 things you'll have a great success.",
            "Awful Game! The play is too easy and takes only seconds to finish each level, which makes sense since the main goal of the developer is to make lots of time for the pervasive amount of ads. This should actually be a zero star \"game\". I use the word 'game' loosely since this is merely one long commercial with three- second-long breaks to play a game my infant niece could figure out. Don't waste your time or money!",
            "The game seemed like it would be fun but in the first 10 minutes of game play i spent at least 8 minutes watching ads i understand developers need to make money too, but I refuse to play a game that has obnoxious levels of forced advertising. Unless you enjoy spending most of your time watching ads and very little time playing the game I recommend finding another game."

            "It's an really enjoyable game but I wish there were a couple of changes. One off those changes is that they added a gear lever or an option in the setting to have one. This is one when your breaking and coming to a stop you don't end up driving backwards. The other change this game could have is to be able to turn the person faster instead of having to swipe on the screen multiple times just to turn around. Other than that I love this game",
            "Yes, I know it is in beta but it is very buggy. I get stuck in the ground, the car camera glitches out and that is only SOME of the experiences I've had. The Demon is WAYYYYY too drifty. Please try to fix these issues by the next upcoming updates. I will rate 3 stars (for now.)",
            "This is very cool and addicting car driving game but please make an option for adjusting and customizing game control button's size and position. Then I will give this review 5 stars. It is very hard to turn the vehicle on steering wheel option due to its smaller size. And please add vehicle customisation like vinyls, paint jobs, spoilers, lips, skirts etc (to make the car looks cool and unique from other players).",
            "The game is detailed good, atleast it's the first time I've experienced such detailed car simulater game. Also it's quests are easy and interesting. Graphics are also great. But there's a bit problem in it. We can only get out of the car in first-person view. I'd like it if you give a button to exit the car in. Third person view(back of car view). Some of the games effects are derived from NFS Most Wanted, I noticed that. But overall I loved this game. Also it's offline.",
            "It is a good game , but I think there should be cars like Toyota fortuner, innova and rolls royce. There should taxi in which we will also be able to hire and there should be more mafia missions , this are the things that I would recommend you to add at the next update. But this game is a really good game. please add the( rolls royce phantom model) add this rolls royce car because this car would make the game more interesting.please add this car by the next update , and the game is interesting"

Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",

I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",

            "Its a great game, but with a game so simple how come there are so many glitches?? 5 consecutive levels freeze up during a stupid ad to where I have to back out of the game and reopen it! Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "Great app! I use this to mess with my friends and family. But, the reason my rating is 4 stars is that there are way too many ads!! I hate that if I want to change a drink, I HAVE TO WATCH AN AD! This has gone out of control. Back then, this game had a fair amount of ads, but now? It's out of control. Another feature I would love is minigames. Also, please make it so that the fruit float so it is more realistic. Overall, 4 stars. Great way to enterain! But please remove some of the ads. Bye! 😀",
            "This app is amazing but there is only one problem, there's too many adds I give a 4 star rating because it puts the same ad I've watched every single time I pick a drink. Yet it still comes to where it did the same ad over and over again🙄 I like it but I didn't want to see all the ads I've watched over and over. GoodBye!👋",
            "Um it's really fun and all but when it caught changing the drinks and picking other drinks that add starts coming in... Everything is I really love the app it's just the ads. Okay the eyes has gone out of control like every time I want to change a simple drink and add comes up you don't know how annoying that is. A beautiful star but once the ads start coming down then, I will give it a five star! Four stars are good enough right? Yes it is so please fix the ads.. it's kind of really annoying.",
            "It's actually pretty good i give it a 5 star rating as we the drinks look 100 percent real as it looks in the app or photos given over here and I don't have to watch an ad i mean if someone is saying this than its totally wrong because i didn't need to watch and ad really cool game 😙",
            "Honestly I like this app, but the advertisements are just out of control. Literally out of control. Not only are they too intrusive, but they're loud and obnoxious!! You can't even simply navigate the app without being taxed 10 seconds with an obnoxious ad. These are the things that make me NOT want to support the developer. \"Select tones already on device\" should NOT have an ad barrier!!!!! >: ("

            "it's still buggy. getting worse, even. the more I use it, the more it crashes and lags. I would rather have that fixed than a new design. and now the coin purchase isn't working either, and sometimes tapping the heart to like does nothing. there was nothing wrong with the layout, please fix the bugs. I want to be able to read the comics. even now, I would like to be able to buy more coins and I literally can't",
            "Firstly, I saw many, many advertisements on instagram for this app and decided to give it a shot. And I'm in love with webtoon now. No joke. There are a lot of other web comic apps, but this one seems to be the only one without a pay wall from what I have found. You can buy coins to read ahead with a fast pass, or be patient and wait for weekly updates on many of the series. Overall good experience and lots of amazing stories.",
            "Honestly, while I do enjoy this app, I'm kind of annoyed that they removed the option to buy $20 worth of coins. That and I get they need to make money, but let's be realistic here, the whole \"one free comic a day of comics that are completed and were once entirely free to read in a day\" thing is kind of meh. You can pay to read them more often, even though the comics again were ENTIRELY FREE BEFORE. You wanna read a 70 chapter story? You have to do it over 70 days, unless you wanna pay.",
            "I love the contents of this app, but I can't ignore the constant glitches. One of the worst ones is that I have participated in 2 seperate events for free coins, and when I went to collect my reward it glitches and I lose out on the free coins. As far as I can tell there is no way to contact them when something like this happens. A Google search for support just takes you to there FAQS forum which doesn't help. I guess use the app, but don't bother with the events.",
            "I used webtoon nearly daily about 6 months ago, then my phone broke and I had to wait to get a new one. I forgot about Webtoon, but once I remembered it, I was excited. All my favorite storys must have gotten tons of new episodes. And then, the new Pass was revealed. I didn't mind fast Pass,Daily pass is stupid. Part of the charm to the comics is that you can spend 30 minutes sitting down enjoying your story chapter by chapter. Now imagine taking all of that away, to 1 chapter. Very short read."

            "I remeber about 5 or so years ago this game was really differant, but don't take that the wrong way, the skins now are really cool and the map almost seems larger! The only thing I would change is to add back some of the old skins, because I thought they were fun and that way you would get more of a variety, because now there isnt as many skins as there used to be, and you have to play, ALOT to get some of the new skins, but this game is super cool and really addictive!",
            "Well, sadly, it used to be 5 stars and not loads of ads. I changed it to 3 stars after there were way too much ads and not only too much, there started to be gross, bloody, inmature ads that is not good for a kid to watch. I feel like now that I wrote a good 5 star review a few days ago about good ads, the developer thinks that I will be ok with the types of ads now. Its fine most of the time but I had to write a bad review after there was an ad that had bees stinging ladys and showing blood.",
            "This game is really good but I played it a few years ago and it was way better of course it's a good game but the skins a few years ago were better and didn't have to unlock them also I thought of was more free or something, I think that's just me though. This is a good game though and I love it ❣️",
            "I like this game . Its a wonderful game because while starting we will be small and while killing others and we will get longer and longer so I love this game .. so....…. Come on and download this game and start. Play but we cant able to play this game in online . But this is a good game to play. So… I like this game 🤗🤗🤗 and my high score is 14000. This was new. Game i was happy",
            "I love his very addictive fun exciting game, however I would of gave it a 5 if the ads where tuned down a bit, I mean too many ads and it would be better and more fun if there was only like 1 ad for 5 games, I would love it, but gotta say I love the new update.👉👈"

Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enough🤔🙄🤬😤🧐🙃😒😠👎👈",

Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off 🤔 And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself 😊 Jackie"

            "i ended up uninstalling. this game wasn't bad until a recent update prevented you from playing offline. it won't load if you have wifi or data turned off. this wouldn't be as much of a problem if the amount of ads didn't outweigh the actual gameplay (turning off wifi/data was the only way around this). as far as gameplay goes it wasn't anything special, and as far as i'm concerned it's not much more than a cashgrab. but, before the aformentioned update, it was good for killing time at least.",
            "This game is fun, but if only the race again button was there every round. Its so hard having to just close the app and re-open it every time I lose the race. Its challenging, but its easy! I hope you take my advice and MAKE SURE TO CLOSE THE APP AND RE-OPEN IT EVERY TIME YOU LOSE THE RACE. And do you play with real people in this one game? I mean its geting annoying having games that seem to have real people playing, but only have an AI. Also I don't like having to watch an add everySec",
            "The game freezes a lot. I loose the won matches. It will freeze in the mid point of the match i.e. while you are running and will force you to close and reopen the app once again. Thus, loosing the whole match. One more disgusting thing is that it will also force you to close the app and reopen it once again if you loose the game more than three times. Thus, back to the same thing - \"Loosing the Whole Match\". Please Fix This Problem... It's very disgusting to loose the games again and again...😣",
            "I hate this game sometimes but actually like this game,so I have this game 4 stars(this game is a online game).I wanted to give this game 5 stars because it has wonderful graphics,so many skins,lots of backgrounds,3 players can play this game in the same time and even 4 structures (normal,body builder,thin and fat)!but,the only thing is that if I lose 3 times then I can't play the game anymore!😡but anyways I love Run race 3d a lot so I gave this game 4 stars.",
            "When you will first play this game you will like it! And then after two or three days you will see long long ads and when the cut option come you can't tap that if you try your play store will open!and sometimes it got no options for next level and it repeats one level twice! And that's the reason why i gave this 2 Stars pls improve these things and it's offline! Thanks."

It is to small to put the photo of my face inside. I would like it if you make it bigger. And when I cut the persons hair, it is messy. Please make this game better.",

This is a challenge for the 3 year old as the ads messes up her game play. I'm one of those people who will purchase a game to remove ads and sadly, that doesn't appear to be an option.",

            "This is a fun game, and I used to love playing it a lot, but they've decided to become obnoxious with the ads to try to annoy people enough to buy the ad free version. Each game session is two minutes. There is now a \"halftime\" in each one to force you to pause and watch another ad in addition to the ones before and after the game. I understand the need for ads, but as much as I have enjoyed this game, this move isn't making me want to upgrade. It just makes me want to find a different game.",
            "This is a very fun app once you learn how to play it i mean I get 500 usually and sometimes 700 and 800 but my higest score is 950 and trust me it's not easy. one thing I would like to add to the game is a rankboard like who is the best player and who us the second best player. Please community of the game answer me and fulfill my wish. thx for making this fun game",
            "I paid to remove the ads and I'm still dealing with the annoying ads",
            "It's a shame to see what this game has become. I've had it for quite a long time now, but the amount of ads has become ridiculous. They even feel the need to interrupt your two minute game with a half time ad. If you like watching ads, get this game, since that's all there is to do. Devs, you did a good job of screwing things up. Way to go.",
            "The game is simple fun and addictive... one drawback is that after the update, my minion count just keeps growing uselessly as i be teached the maximum level ul in all the powerups... its kindof killing the spirit of the game.. Also when we turn into that humongous minion ball, it tends to get stuck inside buidigs , in corners etc and doesnt move for quite a while. This costs precious game time..."

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that 🤭)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! 👍🏻😍😄😁"

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

            "I really like this editing app. It has lots of features and I have found it mostly easy to use. I have used other editing apps but always come back to this one. It would be a great feature in this app to be able to save, search, or favorite certain presets... like the preset texts. Overall, Great App. Good job. Plus, thanks for all the cool things available with this app for free.",
            "This app is really easy to use, and has a lot of options to choose from when editing photos from various filters, to effects. There are so many things to do with this app, even with the free version. The only issue I have is sometimes a picture will become pixelated however majority of the time, the outcome is great. Definitely my favorite photo editing app",
            "You can do alot of customisation and there are presets available for free which are enough to get you going, you can make realy nice edits with what's there you just need to get creative with it. and there aren't any ad pop-ups, insted they're on the side of your editor and don't get in the way of anything which is great. But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",
            "App keeps crashing I have been using this app for a long time now, have had problems in the past but now it keeps crashing as soon as it's opens. So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still keeps in crashing. I have purchased a LOT of effects, so I really need this to work. I gave 1 star because of this problem, if you can get this working for me I will upgrade the rating.",
            "Bestest ever... Amazing app with ennumber of filters & effects. I've been using it for 3 years now and I love it! my all time favorite app. Easy to use and very impressive and the great part is that its almost add free. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

The game itself is functional and has a few songs to play, but there is 500 others like that on the market that don't behave like scams. Oh by the way uninstalling will not unsubscribe you, you have to go to the play store->hamburger menu->subscriptions. Yes I know the first three days are free. It is still a joke.",

            "This is a horrendous app!! Won't allow you to even play, without paying 70 for a 1 year subscription. There is no way to exit, no X or option to use limited features. Total scam. Don't waste your time. Developers, you need to fix this issue!! Or delete the app!! Calling you out...",
            "At first when I saw the reviews I thought they we're lying. But once I installed it, is said Free Trial 67.98/month! Please fix your game developers. And also warning for the people that want to install it. *SCAM ALERT! DO NOT BUY!*",
            "***SCAM ALERT*** The app is a scam,It will not continue until you subscribe to its annual subscription which is about $50 US, This app shouldn't be on the app store. Its something different to give a trial version, but not letting you continue without subscription, thats some next level scam. Let the user decide if they want all the features."

But it's the best game for kids worth game.",
            "I absolutely love this game! However I think there is a bug now that they added the Halloween update. I have seen other reviews that say that the houses are total wrecks. Mine is the same. My houses I decorated have furniture just in a pile, and everything else is just purple. Purple walls, outside on the balcony is purple, the floors are purple, and I cant move anything. Please please fix this bug. I have spent a lot of birthday money on this.",
            "The game is overall good, but before I bought the misty cottage. I had an amazing world and I must have atleast spent 5 hours working on it in total. But as soon as I got the misty cottage, the game started glitching out. Early morning the next day I went on the game and my whole world reset. Now that got me upset. I wish to report this app and I want it to be reported and sorted out immediately. I have everything in the game and its around £70 for it all. Not funny at all. Sort it out please"

            "Although this games is very nice and satisfying, it contains a LOT of AD'S. I'm sick of the ad's covering half the slimes I play with and I've made. To make it more worse it takes TOO MUCH TIME TO MAKE MY OWN SLIME. Another thing that there is little star below which goes to a place with Guess The Slime n Painting, whenever I choose Guess the slime, it automatically changes chosen colour by the correct colour. So, I'll just request to improve the things I've mentioned above. Also it's a good app",
            "It is a weird game BAD!! HORRIBLE AND ANNOYING!! Because it keeps getting ads everytime i think someone said that it takes 10 to 12 minutes to load of making your own slime. He or she is so right and also it takes a lot of WIFI. This game is a fraud. .",

            "Terrible. This game is extremely low quality, and it takes forever for the slime to load. GARBAGE. I gave it only one star cuz the sound of the slime is great, but everything else is poop.",

I love this game! I am not stressed any more! I don't care about the bad things, like, the adds, but any way, THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH FOR PUTING THIS OUT THERE!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!!

            "One ear is always out. I don't know if it's the app or the actual earbuds but I very rarely automatically get both working at the same time, either the right works and the left doesn't or vice versa. It's official, I hate this even more. The left ear is always out, it doesn't automatically connect to things it was previously connected to. I had a pair of Bose SoundSport which I loved, they took two input, once I'd connected a device as soon as I walked by it it would pick it up. These suck",
            "Honestly, these are the worst ear buds I have ever used. I have previously used two cheap ($20-40) wireless buds and they were better than these. Originally had problems with the buds cutting out for 1 second with loud static. Then I completely lost the left bud. No audio would come from it and when outside the case, it wasn't detected. I tried to reset the buds and unpair in hopes of fixing it, but now I cannot even connect the buds via Bluetooth to my Galaxy s10, my iPad tablet, or my PC. Bad.",

It's more useful than attempting to use the buds without the app. The app was optional, but with it, I have full functionality and constant updates which is retained within the buds. So, when I switch them to be used on my PC, the options I have selected still works on my PC!",
            "Was very excited to get these and as soon as I did, my right ear bud hasn't been working. Tried everything to fix it and it's updated to the newest firmware and still nothing. These have the potential to be great but based on the reviews by others it seems they're far from great. Very disappointed, wouldn't recommend buying these until they fix this issue.",
            "They've had an update available for a month and it just never installs (no way to manually force the update). The right bud drains twice as fast as the left. The touch controls sometimes don't function. So far a massive waste of money. Edit: I've done a factory reset, got the update to work (following the ridiculous update method that can't be explained in less than a paragraph). I still believe this is an unfinished product but I'll follow up if the other problems resolve."

At least once it didn't even give me instructions. And you can't retry; it just instantly drops you into another game. Let me read instructions before starting and give me more than 3 or 4 seconds to play it, and then let me retry, and maybe it would be playable.",

It's one of those games that has a style all its own; very hard to replicate !, It's a blast to play, humorous, lifts my mood no matter the day. Excited to try Dumb Ways To Die3 ! Thank you ! Buying a few others too like the hospital & cooking games not just for myself but my 4 year old lol ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",

            "its okay, but you need so many gems to get the stuff and like you got to wait THREE HOURS, to get only TWO ticket things to play again. Also when you finish a thing it only gives you ONE gem. Overall its a good app/game but it's just not as fun when you have to wait 3 hours, and then save your gems because some people don't have or don't want to spend money on a app/game for gems and a good story thing. Then to get all stories is 17 gems, which isn't bad at all, I get why it's 17.",
            "I like how many stories there are and that you can choose where the path takes you but I do not like that all the more well thought out stories have so many choices that are gems. Either you spend your money or choose the option that is so bad. There are stories that have no gem options but I feel like most of those dont even have as many things you can choose. Overall I will give this a three star mainly because of the gem/giving money.",
            "I enjoy reading the stories on episode. I don't have a major problem with gems, however it would be better if we started with a certain amount of gems. Also, I'm not sure, but I don't think you can see the rewards, e.g. after you read 50 episodes and you get 4 tickets every 3 hours. It would be more motivating if you could see how many episodes you have to read to unlock certain things.",
            "Love this app and all the amazing storys. However, it becomes very frustrating when you want to pick an option but you have to pay for it with gems, no only this but I think it is ridiculous that you have to wait hours to get 4 passes, you should change it so you get one pass every couple of minutes (once you use a pass a 30 minute timer counts down to give you another one) as once you are very engrossed in a story you have to wait a while to continue on with it. But the app is great.",
            "It's actually a fun game. But... Why we can't replay the only episode like episode 5 but need to replay from episode 1. Sometimes we might make some mistake, but we need to replay all the game again. Overall its actually fine. But sometimes I watch finish an ad to get the deducted of 30 minutes from waiting the pass, it told me that it have no add available now. So I just waste my times and get a not available??"

The only issue I have is when I speak my message/text etc there is no option to save it for future changes/use & also there's no way to use the keyboard to change any words or names that may be incorrect which is greatly frustrating me but apart from that...GOOGLE ASSISTANT ROCKS MY WORLD!",

Flesh out the conversational junk...I usually end up yelling at the stupid thing and would benefit from the comic relief, at least, if it'd pipe up and talk back... Also, a real BUG I hope has been fixed by now; about 2 months ago when I was really first trying to use assistant (while phone is in my pocket is still my vision fit this thing ps: this if something I might do while riding my bike so, if I ask for several word definitions or web searches?cont",

My assistant and situations I used and had and enjoyed didn't seem so personal anymore:( maybe apple and iphones can use safari voice or cortana and intel cores or manufacturers. Separated...",

            "Such a shame, could have been a really cool puzzle game, but there's just far too many ads.. It's literally ridiculous.. I get that you guys have got to make money.. But forced adverts after almost every completed level, plus a banner at the bottom. Is just pure overkill and greed. I played about 6 or 7 levels and just gave up.",
            "I don't normally review games based on their ad count because devs need revenue, but this one needs it to be considered. The game is simple, which is exactly what I signed up for, but a simple game combined with an ad after every 2 second puzzle is just frustrating and discouraging. It feels like a cash grab. The game itself, while incredibly easy, is alright. I was looking for a good stimulating timewaster, and I ended up with an ad exhibition with breaks sometimes. No thank you, I'm deleting.",
            "It's fun, but the ads are ridiculous. You take 5 seconds to beat a level, then have to watch a 30-60 second ad. There should ALWAYS be more gameplay than ads, NOT the other way around! Also, it's very obvious that some patterns get reused over and over, either that or, after a certain number of levels, they start over from level 1.",
            "The idea of this game is pretty cool but the puzzles are really easy and sometimes they repeat. There are ads after each puzzle, if you're really lucky, sometimes you get 2 before an ad. The good thing is that they made the ads skippable but they're still just as annoying, especially because the puzzles only take seconds to complete. If you can handle the ads then this is a good time waster but if you're looking for something stimulating then keep looking cuz they dropped the ball on this one.",
            "A fun enough expirence because ot was free. I personally disconnect from wifi because I read from other reviews that there were too many ads. But I was able to cycle through all of the levels in under 15 minutes. And they REALLY aren't very hard. I know these games are probably meant to pull in children but I'm a 20 year old man and this really didn't cut it for me :/ didn't have glitches or anything but still a sad expirence. It never really elevates in difficulty."

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "This game, Grand Action Simulator is actually very good and enjoyable to me. I had played this game before. There is problem with this game, it get hanged while playing. If they can fix this problem and if they add more places, weapons and cars. I will give 3 stars. Thank you.",
            "I love this game very much. But I need a game where there is more than 20 countries. There will 1 airport on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One country to another country. (Suppose that I will go from Japan to USA then I will need to buy ticket, like $1100). There will minimum 3/4 railway stations on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One area to another area . (Suppose that I will go from New York to another one then I will need to buy ticket, like $110)",
            "I liked this game so much but i want new job places like a bank,a post office, a office,a police station,etc.And why is not there any fire department,bus station,etc from where we can take the job.We shouldn't be able to take parked vehicles without its keys. There should more of job like buildings which we can go inside to take keys of the vehicle(for rent) parked for the job.After any job is done we should only be able to get money by collecting it from its departmentbyparking itsvehicle back",
            "I rate five stars not because it's a generally good game, but because it's very janky and it's just perfect. But add more houses, a larger open world, and melee weapons. Thanks!",
            "I agree I would like to see more buildings, houses, and countries but overall I enjoy this game."

Fourth, it doesn't sync and fifth, did I already said it doesn't sync? And there's this annoying fact that it always uninstall itself. This app could be useful for my online classes but to be honest it is, well excuse me for the word but– trashy.",

Everytime i switch networks it stops the sync and now I can't attend my Google meets through my Gsuite account because this thing doesn't work at all. And then one day i rebooted my phone and it disappeared. I came back here to re-install and now it won't install. Such a beautiful piece of garbage. And btw...how can this app have a 4-star rating.",
            "since Android 10 update every few days after installing they sync stops. can't sync automatically, can't sync manually, can't sync over wifi, can't sync over mobile data!!! only re-installing the app is the only solution. fix this! this is a major major major inconvenience. I can't but use my University mail services so I'm stuck with this app either way. do something about it update August, 14, 2020: can't register my account at all. just can't.",
            "This app is worst, I tried to login in a work profile given by my university but this app redirecting me to log in again and again and now I can't able sign in and missed classes by this stupid app Google please think about users and update this app please fix the bugs this app made me hate Google apps I am not complaining about other apps but fix it this app is essential for college students,fix the problem"

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Very fun game, but insanely expensive. Want to play single player? You have to pay for it. Want to upgrade your multi-player? You have to pay for it. Then there's the battle pass, premium pass, and thats not even getting to the pop ups after every game spamming you about other deals you can buy. The devs have something here, for the 1%.",
            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",
            "The game was great. Addictive. I am free player and been able to reach to lvl16 but the pain is to constantly watching ads. I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack. But still lots of fun. However this is definitely a pay to win game. Want you obtained Max rank all your characters you cannot continue to advance the upgrades without spending money"

And when we try to unlock it, it asks for money. Please fix this and make it all free with no money. If fix this problem I WILL GIVE 5 STARS. But overall this game is good and I love it 😊.",
            "I absolutely HATE this game, it's just terrible, I haven't even had it for 1 hour before I deleted it. The game has an add every 10 seconds, literally. It is also very laggy, and when I tried to create the skirt it makes you pull the entire fabric over and in the end it looks like trash, so I would rate this a 0 star if I could, You are Welcome.",
            "Hello...Myself Nidhi... This is a very nice game....Only the problem is toooooo much of adds and if google add will come then we can't go again to the game...we should clear that game and then go again...Plz update and fix this problem...I dont need adds.... Is it online....Plz tell me.... If this add problem goes then it can be 4 or 5 stars.... Nice game then👌",
            "This game is interesting.. The only problem is that you can't unlock any of the accessories or designs and they seem to be locked forever.. There isn't even an option for unlocking them. I am at 1st position, and still I can't use that hair-dressing place. I have a suggestion, that it would be great, if there would have been an option that we can earn money in the game, and we could unlock those items, by spending that money. Because they ask for real money to unlock them. But overall 👍👍",
            "Its fabulous ! No much ads! Best part we can post our diy videos! Feel like i have a social media or youtube channel since i don't have it provide 98% like youtube similarity! Just pls for me add an option to comment the commenters bots! Then it will provide 100% youtube or any channel like bots says\"wow! Im on it!\" So there should be an option of writting back them too! No matter if they not reply but it will be my heartwinning! So pls add it! Overall i love it!but 4 stars cus we get bore early"

Its name comes from the word Sunnah, referring to the exemplary behaviour of the Islamic prophet Muhammad PBUH.[1] The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the choice of Muhammad's PBUH successor and subsequently acquired broader political significance, as well as theological and juridical dimensions.[2]\r\n\r\nAccording to Sunni traditions, Muhammad PBUH did not clearly designate a successor and the Muslim community acted according to his sunnah in electing his father-in-law Abu Bakr as the first caliph.[3][2] This contrasts with the Shi'a view, which holds that Muhammad announced at the event of Ghadir Khumm his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor.[4][5][6][7][8] Unlike the first three caliphs, Ali was from the same clan as Muhammad, Banu Hashim, and Shia Muslims consider him legitimate, inter alia, by favour of his blood ties to Muhammad, too.[9][10] Political tensions between Sunnis and Shias continued with varying intensity throughout Islamic history and they have been exacerbated in recent times by ethnic conflicts and the rise of Wahhabism.[2]\r\n\r\nAs of 2009, Sunni Muslims constituted 87–90% of the world's Muslim population.[11] Sunni Islam is the world's largest religious denomination, followed by Catholicism.[12] Its adherents are referred to in Arabic as ahl as-sunnah wa l-jamāʻah (\"the people of the sunnah and the community\") or ahl as-sunnah for short.[13][14] In English, its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism,[15] while adherents are known as Sunni Muslims, Sunnis, Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah. Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as \"orthodox Islam\".[16][17][18] However, other scholars of Islam, such as John Burton believe that there's no such thing as \"orthodox Islam\".[19]\r\n\r\nThe Quran, together with hadith (especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah) and binding juristic consensus form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam.

            "The Game is frequently updated to force players to spend money - alot of money - if they want to be competitive! Otherwise progress is painfully slow. With frequent updates glitches are generated which destroys enjoyment of the game. Slow the update rate down, and give the smaller castles (with little spare cash) time to catch up with the 'big boys'. If not more players will leave in droves and the kingdoms will become more stagnant than they currently are! You must prove the game environment!",
            "The game can be fun, but do not play unless you want to spend money. It requires a lot to be able to play with any kind of semblance of a chance. There are people who spend so much money that you can never ever ever ever keep up and that means you will always be dead in the water no matter what. Edit: Typical response by developer which does not address the issue which is that they encourage this behavior with the way they do updates and game play is implemented. Docked one more star.",
            "Not really a fair game for new players. Peace shields are limited and don't last long enough. Kill events literally end your passion for this game. They need to enable a join feature not an FFA. I cannot beat a kingdom of 30 when I just joined 1 week ago and am at 10. As soon as I pop shield, homophobic and racial slurs blasts the announcements. TL;DR new players gets CC'd and if you don't let others attack you, you get abused with controversial slurs. More work needed.",
            "It is absolutely awful that I've been forced to tap and follow some stupid hard to follow \"tutorial\" that isn't teaching me ANYTHING because of its poor design literally dozens of times FORCED TO TAP WHAT YOU WANT and STILL can't turn that God awful \"music\" off or the sound for that matter. This is extremely horrible and the \"story\" isn't even going at a pace or way I feel remotely like I care to be forced to tap through either. It's terrible. Really terrible.",
            "Been playing since the beginning and this game is a dumpster fire now. Constant updates that make it more more expensive and introduce more bugs than fixes. Also they like to reset major aspects of the game so they can charge you for features that you already had. And if you contact customer service they will tell you whatever is broken is supposed to be like that. Don't waste your money"

            "A very very good game based on the installing mb there are some problems though. It has aimbot which seems to make the game way to easy It is small and can be completed in 4 to 6 days That's about it which is really impressive for a game taking such low storage it is worth it and not pay to play. I have completed it twice with every item which takes a lot longer to collect. But if you are searching for a offline, low storage, good game. I suggest you go for this one!",
            "i do like the game. it reminds me of red dead redemption. LMAO. The only thing that I believe that needs to be done is have a opinion to make the movement cursor position stationary. with it able to move around makes it very hard to keep moving the character around or it makes you exit the game while playing. thanks, Robert",
            "This is the best offline game I have played so far...Best game to it's size....and it deserves more stars..but some actions ruin this game...player puts the weapons in holsters even in a gunfight , we have to draw weapons again and again.And also limited movement of the player, player always gets stuck and an enemy takes about 8 headshots to die(before upgrading)...cannot use stealth even the melee weapons available. But I recommend all to play this game.",
            "I love this game so much the graphics are pretty good for a mobile game, the map size i feel like could be a bit bigger but overall the map size is big for a mobile game and I would really like a update allowing us to head inside more structures like a gunsmith or more random things like the church, the sherrifs office and the prison anyway overall its 5 star game",
            "West gunfighter is the only game I've kept for so long on my phone. This game is so awesome, but I've played all the quest and I will be more pleased if you guys could update it and add more features and quest. It the best horse game I've seen in Google play. Thank you guys looking forward to the update"

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "Literally, BLOWN AWAY!!! I have never experienced a game like this. Deer Hunter is so basic about hunting in such a beautifully detailed environment. And the Events are just amazing! Every single thing in the game makes it more special to play everyday. It stands apart from the crowd of other hunting games and expresses itself in such a beautiful way. The graphics are totally awesome, the mechanics are convenient and the Western music keeps my enthusiasm up! Just change D.H 2018 to 2019. Thanks.",
            "I love the game but can we get more energy like one every minute and why I love it the hunting is great and the dogs are good but can we get more heat in the suits, and more chum, bait, and fishing energy please make the wepons cheaper oh and it takes a while to load but I think that it is worth it please make these improvements.",
            "It's a fun game, I highly reccomend getting it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I get logged out of the game whenever I try a mission in a different region. The main problems for me is the loading screen, it's so long, I have to wait like, 3 minutes to be able to play the game. I don't really mind the ads, they aren't very annoying, and the game's scenery is kinda cool to look at. Overall, it's pretty great, it's my go-to game to install whenever I get a new mobile device.",
            "Great game to be honest. I love hunting the animals and it gives me a surreal experience of hunting. But as soon as you hop online to competitive shooting things take a turn for the worst, people can't compensate at getting better so what do they do? They hack, ever since I got into cts it's been hacker after hacker scoring near impossible scores like 30000, 70000, 50000 etc please fix this, make a program that bans all hackers as soon as a hack is detected and never let those goons get away.",

            "There is a bug where I would watch an ad to get a free spin, but it would load forever after watching, and I wouldn't get another spin. Hopefully this gets fixed, but the game is really fun otherwise, but thats a pretty big bug.",
            "Very well designed App. Good food for brain. But lots lots of Ads. Once ½ of levels are completed more Ads (we can skip after 5 secs) will be pushed in between the levels. After completing ¾ levels, App hangs after playing AD (these are 30secs Ads). For designing, complexity this App deserves 5 stars, but for Ads that are being pushed 2 stars is more than enough. Ads are killing the interest.",
            "Good game I have fun playing during downtime when I go to school but way to many ads after 1 round theres a ad and when you skip it, it gets stuck loading and I have to close the game over and over again.",
            "Best mind relaxing game ever. Whenever I fell bored I always one option to play which is this one. The creator has made it upon the mind of an artiststic person because every artist wants some interesting thing to do as this game.",
            "Very fun game and the ads aren't terrible. But it keeps freezing (loading forever) after almost every ad watched, requiring me to close and report the game. So, when I try to earn extra spins by watching an ad, I get screwed every time."

So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",

Also, I find it very interesting that the app's logo matches with the date that I finally noticed my Google Calendar app. What a coincidence! I even thought that the logo is real-time before I learned that the 'date' or the '31' is actually part of the standard logo.",

Whatever takes more time in an app than on a laptop makes zero sense as a function of an app. Keep it simple. It's a calendar app.",

They just look like the branding/marketing team have taken over any they no longer look like they represent a symbol for the apps functionality rather a Google something. I'm beginning to question Google's direction with the inconsistent pixel experience now this garbage...",
            "I have been using this app for many years, however, the new goal-setting function is very inconsistent. I will set a goal to occur every day, and it will skip random days, with no way to re-include those skipped days. It also does not let you define the duration of your goal, which is quite daft. Goals must have dates in order to be effective. The 'smart' notifications are pretty silly; they remind you to complete your goal, and have an option to tap 'later', which defers goals by a whole day!",
            "New update hijacked my Outlook calendar & added notifications for all events, despite NO NOTIFICATIONS set in BOTH Outlook AND Google Calendar app. Update also caused Samsung Calendar to also trigger alarms for Outook events despite being previously disabled as well. Dev's suggestion to cancel alarms in Google app 1 by 1 for each Outlook event is not a fix. As I stated, NO NOTIFICATIONS is the default, so there's nothing to turn off when new events sync."

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

            "It's a very nice game and I enjoy it very much, I would have given it five stars but the problem is the fuel runs out very fast and also the passengers and the roads are the same please work on that it's really boring carrying the same passengers through the same roads, and also the view keeps changing itself every time I reload on fuel or when I pick up the passengers. Either than that it's really a good game 😘😍😘😍😘",
            "Sometimes I just feel like I should record, for you to know how it's annoying when you want to play a game and it doesn't respond. This game is one of the most annoying games I have ever come across. This game seems to be a very interesting game but when I try to play, it starts to fool. Please do something about it because I cannot just waste my bundle to achieve nothing. I'm very bored today because of this game.",
            "The game is good but not so good. When we this game the graphics and background are merging and the people in the game they are also merge with each other and their is no so long and hard level but when we go to full the tank of petrol we have to give some many money 💰. I don't like this game very much. I will give only 2stars Thank you!",
            "From all rickshaw game this is the best game as campare to other Rickshaw game. I like this game. Just one thing there is problem that when you win all the levels there is no things to do with this game and you have to unistall this game. So I want to give some improvement that if you make the endless game then it's good and also improve your graphics. Graphics are not good",
            "The petrol gets finished very soon. And the driver says the same line \" I Come as soon as possible\" and I noticed that the auto do not have the excess to airport , garage , railway stations etc. And another thing I Noticed that the game is different from the pics given in the discription . But I liked the multiplayer mode."

            "Way too many updates in too short of time. And unnecessary changes to try and make the game harder. For example, you used to be able to pick up an enemies gun by just being close to it, now you have to be on top of a weapon just to pick it up and they made throwing a knife harder, used to get 10 knife kill per match! It's a decent game! My 1st 2 to 3 years of playing this game i had it rated @ 5 ⭐'s but now that they made these unnecessary changes, I dropped it down to 4⭐",
            "Fun to play against people who might be better or as good as me, very competitive but fun. I enjoy seeing new items in the seasons shop comes out because of the accessories and weapons. Its a vs game as we know however I like to play to win most of the time. The controls are simple and over time its gets better because of playing so much. #funtoplay",
            "I've been playing this game for years. Word of advice - Don't buy ANYTHING! I was ripped off for $27.99, and $13.99. I didn't get what I paid for, and Customer Service is ignoring me. I had no problem spending money on this game before. It's harder earning money during COVID, and I decided to spend some here only to be completely ripped off. Don't download. Play Call of Duty instead.",
            "TURN FOR THE WORSE. I've been down since day one, when it used to be fun. I get there's going to b updates and programmers will attempt to satisfy everyone's needs and desires, but as I look thru the comments it seems that most players arent happy with the gameplay. Matchmaking takes forever. Upgrades on guns are difficult to come by. The extra perks for each level of fighting is difficult to understand. It was better when it was just all guns straight up and that was it.",
            "I notice a bunch of people call this game pay to win. It really isn't, they're all just bad. I'm pretty high up there in levels and haven't spent a dime. The game actually feels quite easy. Controls and gameplay are alright, the graphics aren't that bad for mobile, and the items are that busted. All around, it's a solid FPS pick on mobile."

            "Graphics are poor. Not realistic looking people or objects at all. Objects dissapear. Can't get past the second cell level bcuz i cant go back to the cell to see the code on the wall for the safe. There's no help button so don't know what to do next and it just tells you things like \"I wouldn't touch that\"... not helpful. Cannot adjust the sound and the sound/ voices are of poor quality. I don't know if it's freezing or what but this game is slow especially with no tutorial or help button and you think you've tapped and collected everything already. Just sitting here about to uninstall if I can't figure this out or it doesn't move along a bit.",
            "The original version was pretty good. Got stuck on the blocks for a bit, but the challenge is the whole purpose of the game. Would've rated higher but on the reloaded version, after leaving the cell, I could not move in any direction (not even to go back into the cell) or click on anything. I had already used up all the items I had found too. I'm not sure if it's a bug or if I was supposed to do something else, but it's a little off putting.",
            "I liked it and played half of the game. But especially when I'm in the underground and solved the find the way puzzle and then when I got out, it asked again to play the \"find the way\" puzzle.. Nearly 7 times I played that game. Its not fair at all. I went even to the next puzzle but when I exit the app and opened again, it asked me to play \"find the way\".. Frustrating.. I uninstalled now.",
            "Great until the end. Spent ages trying to solve the red green yellow balls. All the walkthroughs I watched, there was a string of 3 balls that only affected each other so easy to solve. Mine did not have this and I do not believe this is solvable. Disappointed",

And even when screenshots are provided, customer service denies everything and never satisfies the customer. Additionally, when the desert oasis was \"upgraded\", I had bought a package that provided 10 additional territories, but I was only given five. I showed them multiple screenshots of their own ad, &.",
            "I have been part of the Lewz community since November 2016. There has always been a gap between money players and those just grafting for rewards. It was manageable and we had fun. However, over the last nine months the additions and changes to the game have been vast and heavily weighted towards big spenders. Not only that. Previous purchases and efforts are being devalued drastically, particularly in the desert oasis event, re gold coins. Only option: REPORT to Google Play!"

            "I really want to like this app because it has a lot of content. It should be, and was, simple and intuitive. But they keep changing it in ways that actually degrade the customer experience. Click the \"immerse\" button and the wheel spins perpetually. Try the help button and the same thing happens. They are turning what was a good hammer -- a simple, useful tool -- into a bloated, mediocre multitool that does everything -- badly.",
            "You cannot go back and review the sections, like Grammar. Once you have completed a section you lose access to the full learning content even if you pay for a subscription. I was very disappointed with this feature otherwise I found this to be optimal language app compared to other options and I tried several .",
            "Very easy to use app . A very good app . Tons and tons of languages to learn from here . Most important , it is free . Very user friendly app and inexpensive to use on . Highly recommend. Now I know 12 languages but I recommend more click to learn languages pages . ( No typing ) to be exact . A very good way to learn languages .",
            "I could not think of one fault about this app. It is fantastic! So far, I've not had any problems and I've had the app for almost a month now. It is a great way to practice French in the holidays, when I'm not at school as my teachers can set class courses. I've also started learning Italian independently and all the FREE features have definitely helped. You can do so so much and I just wish I could write a longer review because MEMRISE IS INCREDIBLE! So much better than other language apps. ❤️❤",
            "I've used, three of the top language apps. And this, is the fastest, and best way, to learn a langyage that I've seen so far! Great Work!! I can't waiit to get paid, so I can get the upgraded version. I am so excited. I have to learn German fast... What a time for my Direct Deposit ti be messed up, without a payment for 2 months! S. Security! Go figure!😓😀😎📆🙏💫💥💪"

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

And there is world where you can explore cool maps. There is also zepeto creator where you can make your own clothes. There's so much to do and I really recommend this game!💜",
            "This app was good until I started playing on a world. I have a couple of reasons why this app wasn't very good. 1 it lagged a lot and I could hardly play or do anything properly. 2 whenever I touched the screen on some of the worlds it took me back to my home screen on my device!!🙄😒😪☹😭😠 Also this app looked very interesting and I put a lot of work into my character then I unistalled! Do not install this game. I only gave it one star for the amazing clothes and characters I loved that!😁😍☺",
            "First, the game is good, I have played it for over a year, has many beautiful clothes but it's have lots of beautiful clothes is nees to much Zem to buy. Second, the game is so LAG when I started playing and go to world( it's made me impatient of this games 😡). Now it's make my phone Lag like in the game when I want to go out. I can't Message with anyone after playing this game. Third, sometimes I turn the circle and I got high money or a Zem and I can't watch ad to get double. That's all🙄!",
            "If u ask me why i put three stars it bcuz: 1. The game start to lag when i use it for long time or entering the world sometimes. 2. When i was abt to turn on camera and do video in world, the game completely shut off then i need to re record again at sec time when i open the game for sec times 3. It sometimes froze for a long time and i need to re open again Pls fix it, its really annoyed me and sometimes my phone get crashed cuz of this :(",

All the items I bought from the creators were perfectly fine and fit for my avatar's head until the newest update where you can change your body type. All the headwears are now either oversized or misplaced (not worn over the avatar's head). Please fix the glitch! We will wait for the new update."

            "On Pixel 2, when there's a notification about an upcoming alarm, clicking on the notification no longer takes you to the app (as of most recent Android update as of 2020-10-31). Also, I swear that rarely, sometimes, the alarms don't go off, especially if they're set using voice activation. For what's supposed to be the premiere, first-party app for this, it's a bit disappointing.",
            "I've been using the feature to wake up to a Pandora song, and I love it, but since a few days ago the alarm plays the song... And an obnoxious beeping alarm over the top of it. This is AWFUL. Please get rid of this or at least add an option to turn it off. If I wanted nasty beeping sounds, I'd just set that as my alarm. Will change my rating if the issue is resolved, this just seemed to be the only place to complain.",
            "ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. Nothing wrong with the Clock(s). EXCEPT since Android 10. I ALWAYS hear 2X the alarm sound , same with the Timer . Why do 2 Alarms play at the same time.? This issue seems to have been solved. But all the Settings are YOURS. I don't have a word. Very tiny little stuff I can do. Like 1 or 2 %. FIX IT. IT'S YOUR APP. Thank You.",
            "I am very bothered about having 2 alarm sounds going off at the same time,,,never had this happen before,,,why? I even uninstalled to factory clock but still happening,,,,I've checked everything I know to check,,,, I'll get my own alarm clock if this doesn't change,,,, And,,,, I see other posts on here with the same issues.",
            "EDIT: This is still happening. At this point I'm 100% sure something is wrong with the app itself. The app occasionally decides to lower the alarm volume to 0 which causes me to not hear the alarm. This isn't the first time this happened. This was also happening 2 years ago. I also reported that bug back then, but Google hasn't replied at all."

There was almost $10 unaccounted for, and no, that money had not expired. It was missing from the current balance shown in the app. This is very annoying and now I can't get what I wanted to.",
            "Still good 1yr l8r. You get random questions depending on your personal allowances on your phone. You answer a few questions and get some money from it. The amount of money depends on the survey but it all adds up!! It's easy to use your balance. This app doesn't take over your notifications. It'll notify you then leave you alone. I enjoy that aspect since so many other app continue to bombard you with reminder after reminder. I would recommend this app to anyone who want just a bit extra money.",
            "Easy to accrue google rewards. I either use on a mobile game or audio books, but there a plenty more options. Easy way to get play money, although it takes a little while to accrue a decent amount, but for the small amount of time investment it is super simple. Since August 30, 2018 until now, Oct 29, 2020 I have acquired $118.85 and I have completed 467 surveys. Some may worry about giving information, to me...I don't really care.",
            "I havent gotten a single survey since I downloaded the app, I have no idea of that is on purpose or not, but I really had hoped to have been able to get at least on survey, but I havent and so I feel that there is little to no reason to have the app...at least for me to have it, but everyone says its great, and so I'm hoping in a future update, yall add more surveys, and spread them out fairly.",
            "Super easy to do. I kinda even wish it asked me surveys more frequently. I love this app, all the small amounts eventually add up. It's too bad the money express though, and that you you can only buy things from the play store that you have the balance to pay for entirely from your Google balance, you can't for example use $10 of Google money that you have and then pay the rest with a different payment source"

Thank you for sharing the stories we appreciate it ♡",
            "I likr this game very much no ads nothing enjoyable amazing there will be a story and when the story will finish u were going to ask a question ( True or False ) amazing stories no ads nothing i have no words for this game if u trust me plz install this game and if u not then dont install but i have removed one star because u have to install that story it take little more time rest all nice game ..",

            "Um can someone explain to me why I keep getting Christian ads when I'm not even Christian!? It literally says \"animated stories about Jesus\" Well since I'm not Christian and idk what you Christians are saying I'll not talk about how this is wrong and that you can't show their faces and stuff and I'm completely going to ignore that the ad was a Arabic and it was saying it in a completely Muslim accent. I'm sure this app is awesome and stuff but I mean I'm no Christian so..."

Surely it does not match the most accure sounds with their real animals like, look it, Rhinoceros and Wolf sounds there is big different with their real sounds and ones in this app even Zebra and dog, and others still not accurate sounds. Too fake the sound of Mosquitoes. Totally it's misleading one avoid it. For me I will not recommend this for anyone.!"

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

I would like some of the users to consider that when under life changing pressure, and you have to think fast, speak in short concise accurate sentences amid chaos, in order to get help efficiently, remebering just three words, rather than a sequence of long numbers in order to get the emergency services to your location can make the difference between life and death. Thank you for this app.",
            "As an emergency service worker, I've used this app on several occasions to locate an incident and its proved to be invaluable. Fire, ambulance and police, along with all other emergency services and breakdown organizations can access the app so its a perfect location finder if you're out in the middle of nowhere, broken down in your car, fallen an injured and needing help. Definately worth downloading, if only to sit quietly on your phone until needed.",

            "Great for those idle moments at the various jobs I've worked. It's a fun twist of a platform runner type of game. The different gun sounds are also quite entertaining. Not to mention hearing \"HEADSHOT\" the way the game does it is satisfying. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something complex, but other than that I enjoy it.",
            "Honestly, I got bored of this after a while so I deleted it, but I hot it back today and it's just how I remember it. It's a pretty fun game. It's simple but fun. Turn in airplane mode if you don't want any ads but you won't get any skins or free guns. Other than that I'm done rating for now. All in all I think this would be a good download for you",
            "Not a bad game. There's quite a few ads, but that's expected from a free game. Gameplay is repetitive but still fun. My issue is with updates. It's been months since there has been an update to story mode, hideout, or gun skins. There hasn't even been new guns or outfits to unlock in the weekly challenge. It's just hammers to unlock, which is pointless when I already have the hideout built completely.",
            "The game is very fun. The ads are reasonably spaced out, about one every 2-3 levels. The gameplay is fun, and you are able to pick how you want to play. The different guns don't have that much of an impact on the difficulty, allowing you to pick your favorite gun, regardless of how much damage it says it does, because everyone except the occasional boss goes down in one hit.",
            "I like the looks of it, but all the movement is automated. The only thing you do is tap the screen when your laser gets on the targets. If I controlled more of the game, I'd like it better. But the concept and art is on point."

            "This is one of the best games Gameloft has created and entertained the world. MUST READ: I have been playing this game since it's release and have grown watching its updates and its growth. I have played it since then on the PC. And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's. And give it missing fighter's in sphere. Please GoR. when we will get new pvp and update. In my phone game is not opening please fixed the errors. From 7 days my game is not opening showing errors. Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

            "I love this game, it is a good one, but lately I have found a lot of server connection errors specially in this last update so try to fix this problem as soon as you can. I also have a suggestion for a multiplayer game in the original base same like the crater in the next season it would be wonderful to share tasks with friends, also please try to make more free rewards than paid ones to be suitable for young players and unemployed people, thanks.",
            "I normally would give this 5 stars, but there are loading problems for me in this game. I'm afraid I'll lose all my progress and $$ that I've spent. Hopefully this will be resolved by support which I have emailed and I can switch this review to 5 stars. I love the game, but the problems right now are pissing me off. I want my progress back, didn't waste a couple of years playing this game to lose it all. Hopefully I'll hear from support soon",
            "This games was alot of fun until I found out that all it takes is one glitch to cause you to lose everything. I actually PAID MONEY to obtain items that would've otherwise taken forever to get. All was going great until a random glitch because the SEASON UPDATE and I lost everything. No change of ever getting it back now. I talk to customer report, and they doesn't care about the customer instead they just replay us with witty remarks. And that not helping at all. I want my stuff get back",
            "Still a grindy money grab. This game will never leave beta. You put time and money in it and updates just wipe away progress. It seems that the developers don't care about my time or nor do they respect me as a consumer. I'm out this game reminds me of a abusive relationship. You get nice flowers every month to forget the daily pummeling. Don't believe me look at the reaction below.",
            "5 star for THE BEST ONLINE ZOMBIE GAME I ever played! But if you are a newbie, there are things need to consider. > The intro loading is a bit longer than usual game. > The game mechanics is based in real life situation so it is a bit hard. (Not all) > Don't forget to enjoy!!! #ComeToOurClanWeDoHelpEachOther. III % (Clan Name)"

            "I like this app. I really do. But I'm sorry, the watermark thing has to go. It's pointless, for what? Too much ads as well. I cant even download a pic without getting 2 or more ads. I can only download maybe like 5 pictures before my last watermark runs out. These two features are making my experience with this app lower. I understand the ads, advertising, I know. But too much ads. I just don't understand the watermark. Without the Watermark, I would've definitely rated this app 4 stars.",
            "Great app but it could be more useful if users were able to write articles with the app.",
            "Have been a user since 2014.. please stop this watermark thing no one does this it's insane I love this app but that's too much .. listen to your users. Thank you",
            "I have three suggestions: 1. Make your interface look better. It's a really early 2000s look going on and you can do better. 2. When you refresh your discover page it really does nothing but give you the same feed just with 3 or 4 new pictures at the top. I'm pretty sure you're not having a shortage of pictures or something so please improve upon this. 3. The watermark thing has to go. Period. Y'all wildin.",
            "I used to LOVE this app to the point I was a heartist for 3 years in a row, I had deleted it for a while to come back to it being a money pit; want to download so many pictures you have to buy a membership, don't want ads buy the membership, ect. its ridiculous, the app used to be a fun outlet for creativity and now half my pictures are under review and its things like plants and art, I really miss the way it used to be, dont bother getting it anymore unless you want to spend $$ over pictures 😢"

            "I find that sometimes there are technical problems such as the the screen being pixelated(like a television screen type of pixalation) or the app itself not working/crashing without reason (I already checked my internet provider and it seems like it wasn't the source of the problem). I hope such issues would be resolved in the future. The design of the app is very neat and clean. Also, It's great that you've put your policies in the display.",
            "Better than YouTube? Yes. Dailymotion has alot of content, movies to watch, a very clean interface and more up to date sleek channel design look, easy to browse, search filters for searching for videos. There are things which i would like to see for Desktop and Mobile. Dailymotion needs a night mode, the explore page needs a gaming and tech section, search filters needs to have more filters, bring back the thumb's up feature, the browse more section has too much sex and nudity kissing nonsense , that has nothing to do with what you're watching. Great site, but needs more features, but i do recommend Dailymotion over YouTube.",
            "Giving this a 5 stat just because google reeeeeally wants me to delete the app. Whenever I get a notification about deleting apps to make room daily motion is always near the top of the list, despite the fact there are apps I haven't used in almost a year near the bottom. It seems if it's not owned by a big tech corporation Google thinks it's a waste of space on my phone. Couldn't possibly be that google doesn't like a YouTube competator being on my phone.",
            "This actually regards the Smart TV app. It's horrible, logging me out often & we all know how tedious TV \"keyboards\" are for text entry. I have externally created playlists that do nothing. I can move to each playlist but clicking on it doesn't open it so all playlists are unplayable. Often, recommended videos start playing their audio stream in the background & can't be stopped. Other videos can't be played because unwanted, unstoppable content is already playing. Better 2 cast from Android app",
            "Some, if not most of the videos require following a link to sign up with details. Its hard to find series that you can just watch direct. Plus not all seasons and episodes are available. But as im persistent I take my time to click many videos before I find a link free episode, then enjoy that, but it can be time consuming. Glad it's free tho!"

            "Game play is fun. However, I feel like they don't do a good job of matching up teams, and the fact that it costs so much for decent weapons. Gold rewards should be higher, and weapon costs should be reduced. I shouldn't have to play for 2 years to earn enough gold to purchase a decent weapon. *update* Since posting this things have changed a lot. The crates that cost 5 gold are finally giving me something other than my 5 gold back, matches are more evenly matched as well.",
            "Weapon upgrade method is good after new update. But what seems to be human hands moving from the ground is not good at all. Because it's against the game being real. And the weapons damage rate is very high. There is little chance of recovery. Control is a bit difficult. And the sounds are unbearable. Over all the game is much better.",
            "This is a great game except for a few major issues which are: 1) the game play is glitchy and not smooth, 2) your aim is constantly getting thrown off if the enemy so much as moves an inch, so you end up missing most of the time, 3) the aim help is no help whatsoever, and 4) every time you are hit or an explosion goes off near you, your gun is thrown around which just compounds the aiming problem. I dont understand what the problem is because Modern Strike Online by Azur has no such issues.",
            "I love this game. I've been playing it for so long and I really appreciate the effort they made to make it more balanced and fairer overall for free-to-play players. But the problems is there supposedly is a gmail that supposedly listens to players' suggestions, critics and problems but I've never got a reply regarding my matters. I really hope that the developers can fix that issue otherwise this game is a must-play and is so enjoyable. I still really appreciate it if I get my problem fixed. ty",
            "I must edit my review to better reflect the real issues this game has. The main issue really isn't that it's pay to play, it's not. It's the match making. The match making causes under upgraded and developed players to be thrown into combat with waaaaay more upgraded players. I like the upgrade system, but perhaps ditching it for a tier based system would work best. Or perhaps adapting the upgrade system to a tier based system would work best. In this way, you can then match make by tier."

        "description": "Interracial Dating: The New Enlightenment\r\n\r\nLess than a century ago, interracial dating was something you didn’t talk about, and something to hide if you did prefer a person of a different color.  There were few places you could go to safely without causing some sort of scandal, and even fewer people who were willing to listen with understanding.  \r\n\r\nMaybe it was the rhythm and blues saturating the basements of late night entertainment.  Maybe it was a society lifting out of the Great Depression, with more tolerance accompanying their more affluent life styles.  Maybe it was the boldness of writers, spokes people and celebrities campaigning for civil rights, but by the 1960’s, interracial dating slowly became more acceptable.  \r\n\r\nThe changing times brought its own set of problems.  Even as the work force became more integrated, with minorities and women stepping into roles once designed for white, professional males, and public places ceased separating or refusing services to minorities, interracial dating was still awkward.  It was an era of general agreement on civil rights, but there weren’t very many among the Depression Years parents who were prepared to bring racial integration into the home. \r\n \r\nThe Millennial Perspective\r\n\r\nThe awkward early years of racial integration jump-started interracial dating.  Today, seven percent of the population claims a mixed race heritage.  The number is growing rapidly, with most interviewee’s stating pride in their multiracial origins and claiming their heritage has made them more open to other cultures. \r\n \r\nSeven percent is significantly higher than in the 1970’s, when only one percent declared a mixed race background, but analysts feel these number are actually only about half the actual percentage, as many who are mixed race claim only one ethnic background.  The majority of those who claim only one race are middle-aged or older.  \r\nFrom Age to Regional Location\r\n\r\nThe younger you are, the easier it is to find a partner for interracial dating.  The twenty to thirty year old set are generally very casual and already have a wide mixture of multi-cultural and multi-racial friends.  Tolerance, however, especially by family and community, can vary greatly according to demographics.  In many areas, especially regions that historically disapproved of mixed race dating, there may no longer be taboos, but the cultural clash still exists.  The family, and even your date, might have stereotypical views of your personal tastes and behaviors.  \r\n\r\nCrossing the barriers where racial misconceptions still exist takes fortitude and patience.  Interracial views are changing rapidly but not racial views.  You may experience those uncomfortable moments of somebody going out of their way not to offend you, anxieties concerning appropriate behaviors, or even suspicion and reserved behaviors.  \r\n\r\nUnless you are dating someone with exactly the same historical background, social status and religion, you are still going to be challenged by your date’s customs.  For many races, the customs are more engrained than color, status or ancestral origins.  Religion may be an important influence on their lives, even if they no longer declare a religious preference, as they will make time for the traditional values of their family. \r\n \r\nBut that’s part of what interracial dating is all about.
