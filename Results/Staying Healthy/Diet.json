            "Only lets you record macros, need $$pro$$ version to record micros, what a shame. liked the layout and all but charging extra to record micros is greedy. Coding in the extra micros is not difficult nor time consuming, shame on the app developers.",

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

            "There are small things I wish I could edit manually. Like how many calories i need a day, I wish I could just out that in myself, and also be able to change a serving and have options (e.g I wish I could log either 1/4, 1/2, 2/3 cups etc of a certain food. I can only change the amount I had by changing the units. That's much harder to calculate.) Idk, this is on the road to bring a great app. I would recommend letting the users have full control to customize it.",
            "Would be great to be able to copy a meal entry from another day to a new entry for ease and for the workouts done that day to reduce the calories added from your meals, so you know how many calories are left over. Would be nice to have a ML/oz, gram etc calculator. Thanks for the app as is however its really great. Best to your team. Maybe as well be able to add in more separate meals for those that eat 6 or 7 meals a day. As well a time stamp of when the meal/snack whatever was logged in. Thx!",

Second of all, it gives you a food planning thing which is really healthy for our body. Third of all, it keeps track of your everyday workouts and your weight. I just really like this app, definitely should get it if you want to lose weight. 😊",
            "It's a great simple app to remind myself to do a little exercise every day. The workouts may seem easy to some, but I find they work muscles that are easily missed during typical weight lifting workouts. With a little know how, it'ss easy to modify the exercises to increase or decrease difficulty. Most of the moves can be performed with very little noise or jumping around. It gets a little monotonous after a few weeks.",
            "Very very very goood app. I live it. I has really worked on me. The coach this app. She is really very good. She gives us tip and directions of the exercise very well. She even mentions where to the exercise like in bed and stuff. I recommend it to every one who wishes ti get fit and loose weight. I swear it really works or effects on u. And the diet plan no words. I really appreciate it and thank u. Keep going.",
            "OMG ! This app is wonderful. First of all we can lose our weight without money. I could loss my weight easily with the instructions voice coach had told. If you follow the exercises correctly you can also find the changes. I will give this app 5 star because of the changes I found while I did the exercises. Thank you very much for Making this app wonderful."

            "I had purchased the pro version of this app - which for some reason is now discontinued. I am now being asked to pay a onetime amount for a repeated pro subscription by the developers. Have reached out to them multiple times over email and have received only one automated response in return. Taking money for the pro version then pulling the application out -- that's a proper scam. There is no guarantee that, if one pays for the pro subscription now, these developers won't ring in the same scam again. Uninstall. Move on.",
            "I have purchased the pro version which I prefer over the free one. This isn't a bad app at all but there is certainly loads of room for improvement. Some suggestions: Add a barcode scanner, healthy alternative options, recipes, grocery lists, conversions and being able to connect to different exercise devices or: Fitbit, Garmin, Google fit etc. My rating will definitely change to 5 star with some or all of these options included.",
            "I've used this app before, paid for the basics. Now that is gone, when I look for foods most are gone now. It's like you deleted your food library. Uninstalling it and looking for a new app. No longer works for me.",
            "Had this app numerous times, and every time ive tried a new one always came back to this one. Super easy and simple as well as personally effective to see what helps me to track what i eat. For someone like me who has ibs it is great to log what u have eaten that day and symptoms as well as weight loss planning :)",
            "I had the Pro version of this a while ago, and it worked wonderfully. Now, I didn't mind needing to pay for Pro again with the new app, but I'm pretty upset that I can't even access the features I paid for... I still get ads, can't access my weight chart. What's the point of having spent the money at all?"

            "I believe this app has potential, though I suggest adding several things: * switching between imperial and metric units. This will make using the app a lot easier for people outside the US. * Adding an option to implement the replacements into the actual diet, so that the shopping list adjusts itself. * Being able to see the shopping list for multiple days ahead. I doubt that anyone feels like going to the grocery store every day",
            "It's a great experience especially because it tells you what to eat in order to get what results. And the stuff required is neither complicated or expensive now what sets this apart from others is the fact that I can even track my progress💃",
            "Pretty good starter for a healthy diet habit. Effective weight loss for the first few weeks, probably shouldn't be continued for a long period of time. Simple and easy to implement. Diet effectiveness depends on body type so it would be wise not to take the numbers in the app seriously, such as 10lbs weight loss per week.",
            "After 6 days I lost 6 pounds so you may need to do it twice if you didn't lose weight in the first 3 days which is fine BECUASE 6 pounds in less than a week is alot! And I didn't even go exactly according to the diet coz on day 3,4,5 I ate snacks. And on day 2 I eat spaghetti with sausage for lunch 😅 but I exciesed each day and bruned 500 calories for 6 days and I lost weight in the end :) oh and if u really want it to work don't eat dinner on the 6th day eat like little snacks on 3 or 4 pm.",

            "The step synching with Samsung Health has stopped working. I thought it was a problem with my phone initially, but as my food entries were synching I realise it's a MFP issue and not the first time. So annoying! 16/10/20 One week later and still not working. What's going on? 29/10/20 Still not synching with Samsung Health. Why is it taking so long? 31/10/20 The new release is not working properly at all, it only syncs a fraction of the total number of steps taken. Just awful!",
            "**UPDATE: I have been using the app since last July 2019. It's a great tool. I have lost 70 lbs. on the keto diet since then, I couldn't have been so successful without it! Helps keep me on track with my goals. **Step tracker is fixed! Thank you! I will say that it was a little frustrating getting an email(actually several) that said my problem was resolved, when it wasn't... their internal term for \"yes, we know it's a problem and we're working on it\" But it's fixed now, I am happy. !",
            "When it works it helps keep me motivated, and there's a great database. However it wants to know why I haven't logged lunch at 8:10 AM (and yes my settings are on the correct time zone). It locks up often, failing to allow me to add goods in a timely manner. If the glitches don't improve I'll try a different app.",
            "Downloaded the app on the recommendation of my trainer and am finding it very useful. The only frustrating part is trying to find certain foods when tracking meals. There is almost too much choice which makes it frustrating to have to scroll through a massive list if what is typed in doesn't match exactly. Other than that this app has been great. Still debating whether to pay for the premium features but only because I'm cheap.",
            "It used to be amazing. Now, it's riddled with premium forced on you and location tracking prompts that don't stop with no way to say 'never show again.' it's not longer simple to use. Update: the intrusive ads are rediculous. You should not get an ad when you hit ad food, or other important actions. They are put in places to seemingly trick you into clicking them - they often appear just as you are going to naturally push a button."

            "This app ticks all the boxes for me for a weight tracking app (I've tried many). It has a decent barcode scanner and a reasonably well curated database, option to save meals and recipes, and a breakdown of macronutrients you consumed in the free subscription. It doesn't try to solve all the world's problems and do it poorly. That's impressively hard to find! I also like the UI, it's pretty, intuitive and uncluttered.",
            "Really love this app. I have used it for a month with no problems, but today I can't go to my goals without the app shutting down. Please fix this! Until today I would have given 5 stars. I've reported problem but haven't heard a response yet.",
            "Bugs fixed. I'd like to add that the year subscription is totally worth it. When paired with GoogleFit I have lost 25 lbs in three months. App holds you 100% accountable when no one else can, if you cheat you cheat yourself out of weight loss. Follow your plan , exceed your goals and the weight will fall off. By the time you realize it it is already a habit and you are accounting for everything u consume. The app will inform u of the areas that need improvement.",
            "Most nutritional information in this app is incorrect. For example, items like calories, carbohydrates and proteins are not always correct and in fact very can be far off. Where my actual carbohydrates are 180g, this app will tell me they are only 130g. This may have something to do with the fact that anyone can go in and adjust nutritional information. The app would be great otherwise but I cannot continue to use it or refer my clients because of the abundant false nutritional information.",
            "Two updates now and calories still do not change when weight changes. I have emailed support, but I guess the engineers just don't care that their app does not work properly. Not sure what their focus is within the app, but they sure are not good a fixing things they screw up thats for sure. I given up on emailing. Seems to be a huge waste of time."

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

            "I really enjoy using this app. It's so much fun to use and the cute little stickers brighten my mood while keeping myself on track with my diet. It's not one of those apps that have everything from calorie counters to diet suggestions but it works great for me since all I need is somewhere to keep a list of the meals I have in a day and write \"notes to self\" to keep me focused on my goal. Excellent app!",
            "this app is super cute!! it makes me happy seeing all the patterns and stickers as I write what I ate. sadly it doesnt have any calorie counting features or finding different foods or anything fancy like that. it's a cute note app where you can log your weight and fat percentage. it also has a calendar. so, if you're willing to overlook the missing features, then get it lol wholesome lil diet app :3",
            "It really is a well-designed and very usefull app. But somehow my diary entries are not being saved. Is there any way you could fix this? I'd be really happy. Apart from this, I can highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to stay on track with their weight!",
            "Really sweet little app! I know some people would like it to track activity etc as well but I chose it because it's purely for tracking your weight. Simple and straight forward! Not many ads but only 76p to remove them anyway. I love it, it makes me smile 😊.",
            "Pretty good app! It's cute and I love the passcode protect. Maybe encourages potential dangerous ideas with \"disappointed\" stickers when you gain weight. But I love this app, the graph is helpful and so is the diary"

Great app tho and can't wait to see what else I can accomplish within the other sections. Ty this app motivated me to continue working on my goals."

            "I love this app. It gives you such a great variety of diet plans and what each one targets. I had my gallbladder and and needed a low fat diet and I found it here. I love the simple shopping list for each week which has made it so simple. The only thing I would like differently is for there to have every week different so you aren't repeating the week before. Overall awesome!",
            "I think I like the meal reminder the best then the grocery list and the variety of plans third. Been using it a long long time.",
            "I miss the support groups that used to be on the app. I met someone from the Netherlands and we became great support tools for each other, and good friends. I miss the \"walk with me\" support group where all the ladies would challenge and encourage each other to walk everyday. This used to be the best part, and it was what made you different from all the other diet apps. Please consider bringing it back.",
            "I've had this app through several different phones over the years. However, even though I've upgraded to pro and there have been updates, there never seem to be any new plans. I saw one reviewer mention keto plans, and I was REALLY hoping for the exact same thing! With as popular and well-supported with research as keto is, you'd think they would add it on here. Oh well......come on, guys, change with the times! Science does, and so should you. :-("

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "This app is the best for me out of 4 I tested: -widget \"as I want\" is available with an affordable ($3) ONE OFF (others had rec fee!).I wanted a discreet widget from which I could directly quickly top-up my intake. Widget has several options to customise :) -easy to use, customise cup size, daily goal.. can also have \"standard\" goals based on gender, weight, active lifestyle -achievements for motivation Suits me very well :) Would love integration to GoogleFit or MyFitnessPal :)",
            "Real simple and easy water tracker. Appreciate the ability to customize the water size and the widget is super useful to access from my home screen. The notification helpfully has the ability to add water from the pop up, but I wish it wouldn't open the app up automatically when you click it. It would make things easier if you could just add water from the notification when it comes up, then continue without interruption. but besides that, it's useful and practical.",
            "Good, helps and always reminds me to drink water. I do have a suggestion for the widgets though, can you make them add an amount of water to your daily goal without opening the app? The widgets are kind of just a display of your intakes but isn't really that functional. Also please make it able to write your water intake the previous days, because I just installed the app but it doesn't let me because I have not installed the app in those days yet.",
            "I am a water drinker everyday all day long and my doctor told me I was drowning my organs due to the amount of water I was consuming. This app helps me keep track of my intake that I show my doctors. Great app",
            "I like this app a lot because the app will remind you to bring the water I think you will install the app and you guys can decide the notification sound I think you will install this app install and great the app thank you but first I am telling you one thing when you do not get notifications you can comment in the Google Play store and they will tell you what to do one time I just get like that problem then i tell them they solve it ok bye my dear friends ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺"

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

            "I've been using this app since July and have always loved it. However since the last update, I have to manually enter/ search for everything each time as the feature for remembering previous foods/drinks no longer works. It's a bit inconvenient since a lot of my things have to be scanned. Also, the different options for measuring (gram, cup, tablespoon, etc) is missing on lots of items which makes it hard to be accurate when you only have 1 option.",
            "Its great! I like that it has an extensive food list, I can keep track of all my measurements and see trend breakdowns. Love the recipes too! App functions better than others that I have tried. Nothing glitch-y or slow loading screen. Easy to use! The information entered is correct! I have used other apps, where when you put in the food item, it will have completely wrong carb information. Drove me nuts! The price is better also, some other apps want you to pay $10.00 a month or like $60 yearly.",
            "I have tried many apps while looking for a tracker. This has been the best one! I love the search on the database, it's concise and easy to locate items. Recent searches show up first. One of my favorite features is that you are able to select the measurement of food instead of converting from grams or guessing how many pork rinds are in 14 grams. It is really easy to customize the macros to suit your personal goals. You can also add foods by scanning a bar code. Great app! Money well spent.",
            "I've tried different keto apps, but this one is by far the best. Not only can I easily keep track of my calories, fats and carbs but the app helps me keep track of my water intake and moods as well. This is my favorite app for my keto lifestyle. I've tried keto several times in my life and have been semi successful. The only thing missing was this app. I feel that with this app, I'll be able to monitor my food intake better, monitor my carbs better and ensure better success for myself.",
            "Just started using this app the first of August 2020. But so far it's great! Easy to use. Just enter the foods you eat and the app tracks the macros and keeps up with your daily intake. 10/17/20 Just did an update. Do NOT like it. Can't find foods I've used for 2 months. The app randomly changes the macros on the exact same item. Multiple issues with the update.Had to go down to 3 stars. I want to go back to the old one I had."

            "I purchased the premium version only to find out it doesn't sync with my Samsung active 2 or samsung health It's a decent app to track your macros which I was doing fine in the free version. The app is confusing and requires a lot of extra input if you wanna use the premium features. The recipes are typically off on the macros. Also, there are often several options to choose an item to add, for ex \"egg\", and when you open it, it might be \"taco soup\". I regret purchasing the premium version.",
            "The app is simple and VERY helpful, especially if you are beginning your Keto journey like me. I love how the graphics help me monitor my progress. I've lost my first 5 lbs and I honestly feel this app has definitely supported me in doing this. I'm surprised I didn't quit using the app like I've done before with other apps. Give it a try. I'm SO GLAD I did :)",
            "This is absolutely a keto must have. I can't believe how good the food database is. I love that you can copy meals to multiple days and log your food diary for the week all in one shot on meal prep day! I noticed theres some kind of glitch scrolling through the values when you log a food. For example, when I indicate how many grams of avocado I'd like, sometimes the number value disappears if I scroll too fast and I need to go backward out of that food and back into it to make it work.",
            "This is the app you want to get if you are going to go on a keto diet. I liked it so much I bought the paid version. It has helped me lose 76 pounds and still losing weight. Would have given 5 stars but the app is painfully slow to load. To the Developers of this app. Please do something about how slow it is to load. I'll change my review if you can do this Cheers",
            "Love this tracker it is beyond easy and intuitive. Save recipes, copy anything to any day you want. Scan barcodes. Set up meal reminders and anything else you might need in a simple easy to read design. I \"WAS\" using 'my fitness pal' but seriously Carb Manager gives for free what MFP wanted me to pay $50 a year for.... CM is the best and I recommend it to everyone on keto or not because it's just that amazing to use & you DON'T need to pay!!"

            "I paid $19.99 and am extremely unsatisfied. I have already canceled and wasted $19.99. The only thing it allows you to do is log your food, water, and counts your steps. My Fitness Pal does all of this for free! Better Me literally sets you up with a plan, after you pay them initial money, you have to continue to pay them more money to get more access to the plan. I feel like I have been scammed.",
            "It is great app when you pay those $20. You get the meal plan on email, you get access to how to prepare many meals, etc. But, when I was asked to pay for diet plan there wasn't any info that it is a limited time subscription. Additionaly, after subscription ended I lost access to the app - totaly. Only screen I can see is the one that offers me different subscription options. So, you basicaly pay for email document with a diet plan and limited time to use the app.",
            "Good concept, but needs work. I like the hydration reminders, nice workout selection with subscription, but the tracking is severely limited. Food defaults to the same portion for every serving size (3.57oz) with no standards for basic items (like an egg) and you can't go back and add things the next day. Can't adjust fasting start time if you forget. Training suggestions pop up super late at night (like, 9pm) with no alternate timing options. Weekly reports don't include all tracked items.",
            "Doesn't provide the custom meal plan that it suggests from the personal preference questionnaire. There is only screen viewing. PDF access would be better for meal prep & exercise at the gym. I leave my phone in my locker so I don't loose it on the gym floor. This app is a bonufide gimmick. This type of plan can be found free in many versions on the internet. Subscription CANCELATION is proving to be a nightmare. I signed up 9 days ago & have been trying to cancel the renewal for 4days. Helping!",
            "So far so good. Glad not experiencing any real challenge with the app other than it freezing up or buffering during the workout. Will update as I experience more. Update - App did not live up to my expectations. Food diary list of options extremely limited. The plan started me out fasting, Wich is no big deal. However, it says I will be notified when to end the fast 16 hrs later no notice, 20 hrs later still no notice to end fasting. The workout/exercise plan did not record my activity."

            "Works great. Takes a bit of time to learn to navigate the app. Surprised at the number of vegan recipes available. Some food were incorrectly inputted so I sent a report and also updated what I have. I wish you could update the info yourself. Also, I wish there was more flexibility with the intermitten fasting time. Overall, happy and hopeful it will help me achieve my weight loss goal.",
            "I've been using this app for quite a few years and it is pretty decent. However, I was quite disappointed that the search option for one's own foods was removed; now one has to scroll endlessly until they find the food they are looking for. Furthermore, I would suggest adding a meal prep feature where one inputs the nutrition details for what one eats, but then the actual calories and stuff is only added to the daily counter once it has been eaten(a check off system).",
            "I really love how many options of food there are, I can always find the exact thing I've eaten on here and how much I had. The only thing I don't really like is the feature connecting the app with a step counter app like Google fit, it doesn't really seem to work properly and update my steps so I've started just adding them in manually. Aside from that it does all I need.",
            "When you search food it doesn't have as many options as I would like, such as restaurants. It might have one calorie count for something and the one below it is completely different. It's hard to know what's right or wrong. You can add them in but I don't want to do that every time so I feel like I am guessing. I wish it would have things set as peice or amount. It reminds you frequently to log info and encourages you which I like, and has a lot of meal options. The meal calorie count is nice.",
            "I'm using it to track my dietary supplements, it's pretty straight forward, and you can add your own foods (like your mom's recipe and stuff). I wish I could be more precise with the measurements (Adding Vitamin D in milligrams is pretty useless, for example) and that it accepted more nutrients (my supplement has a ton of vitamins and minerals, and it would be nice to track those. I wish I knew an app that could approximately the micronutrients content of my mom's recipe too...)"

Spreadsheets aren't that easy to manage on phone screens. But this app is completely customisable, even to creating one's own entries as user definable units. I've been tracking my food for years, and this app has just made it so much quicker and easier! To the creator, thanks so much, dude. Brilliant job, and I've just bought the full-featured version. 👍",

No need to make a profile, search for brands (or at all), and has options to include any macro and how you want to display them next to the name or not. it shows remaining or total. With a toggle.

            "Disappointed. The app is useless. And Google does not refund unless you request it immediately vs other apps that offer 30days guarantee. The plans are chaotic, they do not adapt based on feedback and input, and coach feature is worthless. It can be used only as basic tracker, but there are other options that work better and with reminders.",
            "UI is actually quite... unclean, like not really minimalist, and not really inforgraphic. Especially for first page, sections separated quite bad. If you follow the circle you should add the statements ( insulin up down, keto, autophagy...) onto the circle directly and touch icons for more information. Also the circle is boring, even i reversed it, nothing happened and such an eyesore to see the time elapsed but the circle still run remaining.",
            "I really love the update to the Coach, but now I'm having issues with not getting the notifications. They were working fine last week. I've had to reinstall the app, losing my progress. Hopefully this is the last time I'll have to do that. I really love this app",
            "My notifications aren't working since the latest update. I made sure notifications were enabled in my settings. I turned them all off & back on in the app too. I don't want to have to install a separate water reminder app or set alarms for when my fasts start & end!",
            "I would like a refund. This is the most useless app ever. It doesn't even show on your apps screen. You have to go to Google store to open every time. Just refund my money. I downloaded last night and am requesting my refund back onto card. Nit happy.....Leda Green"

A lot of people with muscles and good shape in the \"Afters\" 🤔 If it was that easy and simple everybody would be doing it!! Be real!!",
            "Down 5lbs! I have used this app many times when I want to drop a few pounds and when I stick to it and exercise, I always lose weight. I don't have much to lose as I'm within normal limits so weight comes off slower. The only thing I'd recommend is adding the 4 other days of menus that can be found online under military diet.",
            "Of all of the \"MILITARY DIET\" apps available, this one has some of the best features: At a glance photos of your meal. List of possible substitutions listed along side each meal. Great and simple explanations. The only drawback is the advertisements and no options to pay for a no ad version. 4.5 Star. 5 Star if an opportunity to buy a no ad version is added.",
            "Clear and easy to follow. I like the fact that the substitutions are on the same page as the days menu, it's very helpful and great for an easy reference.",
            "It's a good app. Has good content. But get rid of the ads. Nobody looks at them and they appear Everytime you press the back button or exit the page. It constantly asks to rate the app after I've done it twice."

It gives you the option to choose between different WW programs, so you get to choose which one you would like to use. Free, unless you prefer pro option (which allows for extra micronutrient tracking, and pairing with Fitbit or other device) Wonderful app!",
            "This app is better than any I've ever used,including WW and my fitness pal. Having the macros is very informative,and it connects with my Fitbit! The recipes are regular food,not a bunch of weird stuff. So easy to use. All this for only 19.99$ a year! WW cost that much for one month and they don't have your macronutrients. Try it,I promise you'll love it. Tracking on MyDiet Daily can and will help you lose weight the healthy way.",
            "This is a good app. However, it isn't always consistent. When you log your food, if you change the serving size, it will sometimes zero out the points. There are still some glitches in the programming that need to be worked out. Overall, a good app. Update: I paid for the extra features, however, it wasn't really worth the cost. I thought it would give me more access to restaurants, however, restaurant selections are EXTREMELY scarce. This is an area that can definitely use LOTS of improvement.",
            "Loving this app I struggle with eating healthy and have yo yo dieted for years. I have tried different food trackers but they didn't seem to fit right. Once I found this app and seen it correctly counted points and was easy to navigate I have stuck with tracking everything and within a few weeks started to see weightloss and feel better :)",
            "This app is AMAZING. I recently lost 12lbs on weight watchers and decided I didn't want to pay $26 a month every month just to get better health so I looked for an alternative. This is almost the same as weight watchers just takes a tiny bit more work to be sure the points are correct, which you can do with a quick google search. Don't hesitate! It's so affordable and a great deal for something that will help me regain my health again. I've already recommended this app to several other people!!"

        "title": "Fasting App - Fasting Tracker & Intermittent Fast",
        "description": "Fasting Tracker will guide you to a new lifestyle with healthy habits. You’ll lose weight effectively and feel more active! No diet and no yo-yo effect.\r\n\r\nIS IT EFFECTIVE?\r\nIt’s proven that intermittent fasting leads to fast weight loss. During fasting, as your glycogen depletes, your body switches to ketosis, which is referred to as the body's \"fat-burning\" mode. This is an effective way to burn fat.\r\n\r\nIS IT SAFE?\r\nYes. It’s the most natural and safe way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems, such as diabetes. When you fast, you just take a break from eating, it takes some of the load off your liver.\r\n\r\nCAN I USE FASTING TRACKER?\r\nWith various fasting plans, fasting tracker is suitable for beginner and experienced, men and women. It guides you through your plan. No need to change your diet, you can easily stick to it.

You’ll lose weight effectively and feel more active! <b>No diet and no yo-yo effect</b>.<br><br>IS IT EFFECTIVE?<br>It’s proven that intermittent fasting leads to <b>fast weight loss</b>.

This is an effective way to burn fat.<br><br>IS IT SAFE?<br>Yes. It’s the <b>most natural and safe</b> way to lose weight. Studies show that eating all the time makes your body unable to take a break from digesting, which can result in health problems, such as diabetes.

            "Been using it for a little over a month or so. I have such difficulty sticking with fasting, but this app has really helped keep me accountable, plus it's simple and there's not a ton of ads or \"extra features\" in your face. The overlay timer is a great constant reminder, and I like the water reminders. Only improvement I'd want is an option for the timer to be counting down and not up.",
            "Just started using this app yesterday, but I really like it so far! Best feature I've found is that you can totally customize the amount of water you're drinking. There are so many different sizes nowadays that the ability to adjust the number of ounces makes a big difference. I also love that it tells you what's happening at each stage of fasting throughout the day!",
            "This was the second fasting app I installed, and the one I've stuck with. It's convenient, easy to track, and has most of the features I'm looking for. Previously I gave 5 stars because it seemed to be missing actual start and stop times in the history. But the feature is there, I just missed it. User interface could be improved to make that more obvious. It's a great app and works offline too. This is likely the fasting tracker I will stick with.",
            "I really like the app, it's exactly what I was looking for. It says pay 2.99 for ad removal, but honestly I haven't experienced any ads, besides a very rare one up top. My only complaint would be the subscription, I would pay for it if it was a one time purchase, but I'm not interested in getting a subscription to an app, sorry! 5 stars anyway because the free material does it's job.",
            "I like this app and I appreciate it. Just I have paid $2.99 for ads-removed from the app but the app still shows the ads and ask me to pay again for removing Ads!! I have already sent an email to the developer but I didn't get the response! I'm waiting for your reply as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and support. (UPDATE) I solved this issue by reinstalling the app. Thank you."

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

            "Love the app, enjoy the recipes to help with the food. But It need more choices for food. I would like to be able to add my own recipes. Or if I didn't snack that day I would like to be able to remove food. Also if I can change my workout to show that I've burned more calories.",
            "Great app! So far the best diet app I have used to date. Easy to follow with calorie count, recipes, exercise, weight tracking and water intake reminders. I love the flow from meal to meal and day to day. Just what I needed in my life. Thank you!",
            "I love this !!! I was searching for the perfect weight loss plan and this is it. It gives you day by day on what to eat, how much to drink, and exercise. Awesome!!!",

Most body cells prefer using blood sugar, which comes from carbohydrates, as the main source of energy in the body. But when there is not enough blood sugar, the body begins to divide stored fat into molecules called ketone bodies (the ketosis process).\r\n\r\nEntering a ketosis is the goal of the Ketogenic Diet. When your body is in a ketosis state, the liver produces ketones that become the main energy source for the body until we start consuming carbohydrates again.\r\n\r\nThe Ketogenic diet is also referred to as Keto diet, Low Carb diet, and Low Carb High Fat (LCHF). \r\n\r\nThis means not eating High-carbohydrate foods like fruits, bread, pasta, grains, cookies, and ice cream. Also, you have to increase your intake of fatty foods, like oils, butter, and fatty meats. It's also important to not eat too much protein. You should only eat just enough protein so you don't lose muscles.\r\n\r\nSo how do you get started with keto?\r\n\r\n• Plan your meals.\r\n• Drink enough water and get enough sleep.\r\n• Calculate your daily macro goals:\r\n\r\n- Fats\r\n- Protein\r\n- Net Carbs = Total Carbohydrates - Fiber\r\n\r\nYou will find all the important information about Keto Diet in the application.

Its an easy to use app(with pictures of how your meal should look like after prepping) and has all the nutrition facts too. Thanks for the awesome app, I like it.",

Whether your goal is to lose fat, build muscle, improve your metabolism, or simply maintain your weight, Carbon Diet Coach removes the guesswork.\r\n\r\nCarbon Diet Coach is a science-based nutrition app designed by renowned nutrition coaches Dr. Layne Norton (Ph.D. Nutritional Sciences), Holly Baxter (MS Dietetics), and Registered Dietitian Keith Kraker (BS Dietetics).\r\n\r\nIt does everything a normal nutrition coach would but at a fraction of the cost. Simply select your goal, answer a few short questions, and it does the rest! You will get a customized nutrition plan based on YOUR goals and metabolism.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, Carbon will adjust the plan as you progress to optimize your results.

            "The app is currently not working. I just purchased a subscription and as soon as i go to create goal i get stuck on the weight field. As soon as i put in the text (kg -> 105) the app gets stuck and crashes within seconds. I then need to log in again and start all over. Also you have to choose the birthyear from an interface which forces you to manually skip from month through month starting at jan. 1984 until you make it to your birth year. Thats very inconvenient.",
            "I was aware that there was no German food database, which is fine by me, but even after entering items that failed bar code scanning manually they still won't be detected by scanning the bar code afterwards. If you have no idea how to setup your calories and macros, the app is useful. For tracking food (outside of the US I guess), not so much.",
            "Amazing, worth 5 times what you pay. Can't say enough good things. I've been counting macros for over a year, had carbon now for a month or two and my results have gone through the roof. You're getting a macro coach (and a really great one at that) for practically nothing. If you put in your food accurately I have no doubt any one would have less than amazing results.",
            "Really annoting data entry issues. 1) when swapping to other apps like a notepad, picture of your scaled food, or spreadsheet, it dumps all of your work and the app restarts. It doesn't save it untill the end. It doesnt hold its place in the background. So it doesnt utilise cache data effectivly like it could. 2) When scanning something it doesnt appear on your most recent. I'm not sure if you have the option to add it to your my foods list.",
            "I love the functionality of the app and how it is all set up. However, how can you put a product out in the market, charge top dollar and out of 10 products I scan, all of them have the wrong nutritional information?!?! Dr.Layne and team, please fix this, it is annoying and frustrating. Get a better database to pull the info from."

Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check by shuttling the glucose into cells, but when there’s a consistently high amount of insulin, your cells become resistant.\r\n\r\nThis insulin resistance makes it easier to store fat, and chronically high levels of insulin also cause excessive inflammation in the body, which contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure and eventually type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nA keto diet can reverse these harmful effects & restores insulin sensitivity.\r\n\r\nTHE KETO DIET IS A NUTRITION REVOLUTION!\r\n\r\nThe nutritional landscape is changing. The keto diet (low carb diet) is growing in acceptance and a nutritional revolution is beginning. We are starting to realize the detrimental effects of our relationship with excess sugar & carbs.\r\n\r\nThe keto diet focuses on low carb recipes to keep your blood sugar stable, helping your body regain insulin sensitivity and keeping your mood & energy levels stable.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re on a ketogenic diet, you can expect to:\r\n\r\n• Lose body fat\r\n• Have consistent energy levels during the day\r\n• Stay satiated after meals longer, with less snacking and overeating\r\n\r\nHUNDREDS OF LOW CARB DIET & KETO RECIPES!\r\n\r\nKeto recipes make you feel better, live better and eat better.

            "I am surprised to note that there is an app that has been developed as if it were to be used in stone age. I recently changed my mobile device and hence got logged out of healthifyme.When i logged in again i lost all my data. I raised concern and was told that once i logout all my data will be lost!!!!!!. Grow up developers!!! There are n number of time i might have to logout. You want me to start from scratch everytime? I have lost data from March 2018 to October 2020. Will uninstall the app.",
            "I really like this app, especially if you subscribe, it will give you meal plan & you can adjust to your preference. However, at some point I find it difficult to tract everything in a single day. time consuming. Careful when you purchase the 1 month subscription, it will auto renew, so always remember to go to google play to cancel subscription to avoid money deduct automatically from your account.",
            "I had a really bad experience with this app. I had taken monthly membership of live studio. My membership got deactivated after 10 days for some reason. I had almost 10 classes left for the month. I reached to customer care. They just gave some copy paste reply and didn't resolve the problem. I waited for 3 days and then accepted that I lost my money for such a useless service. Don't waste money here there are better apps available.",
            "I don't know what actually happened with this app... Previously it was working good but after recent update, sometimes it doesn't count calories.. example if I'm walking and at 2000 steps if it's showing 200calories burnt so even after walking 5000 steps it'll show the same 200 calories burnt. I tried refreshing it, restarting app, even my phone.. but it doesn't work.",
            "I really liked the studio session but I personally felt that the smart plan is not at all useful and it's a waste of money. However the studio session is really really good. The coaches are very interactive, correct the posture immediately and give good motivation to push ourself"

I don't know if it's thanks to the macros (which recommended a bit more protein than other apps), the electrolyte tracking (I started supplementing magnesium) or the recipes (which are really tasty by the way) but it helped me get the scales moving again. Whatever it is it worked!",

            "The app is currently not working. I just purchased a subscription and as soon as i go to create goal i get stuck on the weight field. As soon as i put in the text (kg -> 105) the app gets stuck and crashes within seconds. I then need to log in again and start all over. Also you have to choose the birthyear from an interface which forces you to manually skip from month through month starting at jan. 1984 until you make it to your birth year. Thats very inconvenient.",
            "I was aware that there was no German food database, which is fine by me, but even after entering items that failed bar code scanning manually they still won't be detected by scanning the bar code afterwards. If you have no idea how to setup your calories and macros, the app is useful. For tracking food (outside of the US I guess), not so much.",
            "Amazing, worth 5 times what you pay. Can't say enough good things. I've been counting macros for over a year, had carbon now for a month or two and my results have gone through the roof. You're getting a macro coach (and a really great one at that) for practically nothing. If you put in your food accurately I have no doubt any one would have less than amazing results.",
            "Really annoting data entry issues. 1) when swapping to other apps like a notepad, picture of your scaled food, or spreadsheet, it dumps all of your work and the app restarts. It doesn't save it untill the end. It doesnt hold its place in the background. So it doesnt utilise cache data effectivly like it could. 2) When scanning something it doesnt appear on your most recent. I'm not sure if you have the option to add it to your my foods list.",
            "I love the functionality of the app and how it is all set up. However, how can you put a product out in the market, charge top dollar and out of 10 products I scan, all of them have the wrong nutritional information?!?! Dr.Layne and team, please fix this, it is annoying and frustrating. Get a better database to pull the info from."

My only issue is that you can't swap out recipes on the app for your customized meal plans, and the shopping list doesn't update to your recipes you've swapped, so then you have to go through every recipe and write your own shopping list to accommodate your meal plan. Its a handy app, but I keep finding myself having to go back onto the website and taking an extra half hour to update my shopping lists.",

            "Wow! I am so impressed with this App! It's very easy to use. It shows you how to do the exercises and it even counts the seconds for you!!! It's definitely motivating! Thank you for such a great app!!! The only thing I can't work out is how to use it on my IPad or laptop. It connects with my google account and phone thats it..... Be great if someone could help me get it on one of those devices please! 🙂",
            "I LOVE this app. It's AMAZING! There are exervcises for every training. You can even do exercises in your bed and office. This is so convenient and it also tracks your exercise and reminds you to drink water. I absolutely reccomend this app. It also helps you loose weight and keep you fit. Definitely recommend downloading this! Keep up the great work! 👍",
            "Fantastic app with great fitness features! Way better than an app I paid 20$ for 3 months for. Ladies, give this a try. I'm finding myself doing a bit more and more each day. It's fun, easy, and comprehensive, yet challenging when you're comfortable taking that next step and increasing your duration and intensity. Very user friendly: great pause/stop functions and additional direction when you need a move or pose explained in greater detail. I should of just went with this!",
            "Best of all. I have came across several apps to give me a proper plan to stick on. Out of all this is the best. Honest opinion. I wondered how it got high ratings and I downloaded. Ended up giving high rating😂 Pretty sure you will fall in love with this app. Ads aren't that disturbing and the UI is pretty descent. Be honest with the app and it will give u a very good result. Go on with it.",
            "I thoroughly like this app, I do have one issue but it isnt enough to drop a star in my rating. I would like the option to enter in workouts I have done not on the app. I do 20 minutes of cardio every morning and would like to track that with the rest of my things on the app. I will add the water reminder is incredible to have. I hate water and will go days without 1 sip other than to brush teeth so this is a huge help. Over all I enjoy using the app."

I haven't seen a lot of ads. If you don't want ads, change your settings or permissions.There is no prob with password reset. If you do have a prob with it, log in via the app first. If you're using the website, log in there with same password. Then sync if you'd like: option is in both the app & the website. It all works fine.",

            "Ads are pretty pervasive. There is usually an ad after every action. If I enter breakfast with 3 items, my action is delayed after each item. I would go to the premium but the option to purchase once yearly is not offered and must be debited monthly. (Not something I can do.) Thank you. I will try that. I did as suggested but the app will not let me enter foods, etc. It will not accept my goals entry. For two days I've gotten a msg asking me to connect. However, my phone is connected to the net",
            "Extremely inaccurate info, nothing I've scanned has had the correct information when compared to the labels. I don't have time to search through the hundreds of incorrect entries from members to find the one that's accurate. You also can't do anything on the app without being forced to watch ads. I won't be continuing with this app.",

Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check by shuttling the glucose into cells, but when there’s a consistently high amount of insulin, your cells become resistant.\r\n\r\nThis insulin resistance makes it easier to store fat, and chronically high levels of insulin also cause excessive inflammation in the body, which contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure and eventually type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nA keto diet can reverse these harmful effects & restores insulin sensitivity.\r\n\r\nTHE KETO DIET IS A NUTRITION REVOLUTION!\r\n\r\nThe nutritional landscape is changing. The keto diet (low carb diet) is growing in acceptance and a nutritional revolution is beginning. We are starting to realize the detrimental effects of our relationship with excess sugar & carbs.\r\n\r\nThe keto diet focuses on low carb recipes to keep your blood sugar stable, helping your body regain insulin sensitivity and keeping your mood & energy levels stable.\r\n\r\nWhen you’re on a ketogenic diet, you can expect to:\r\n\r\n• Lose body fat\r\n• Have consistent energy levels during the day\r\n• Stay satiated after meals longer, with less snacking and overeating\r\n\r\nHUNDREDS OF LOW CARB DIET & KETO RECIPES!\r\n\r\nKeto recipes make you feel better, live better and eat better.

It logged down 3 steps just starting it and for every 1 step I did, it showed at least 5. I downloaded the basic version to see if preminum would be worth it. The two main things I wanted in an app are two that are inaccurate or unavailable.",
            "I intent of this app is just want I needed. Unfortunately for me, the execution just didn't live up to expectations. For example, I have a watch to track my steps & the app doesn't allow you to enter them, only miles. The vital section does not contain BP. It is located in another section. The BMI calculator is not accurate, imo. There are additional issues that I have w/ the app but I believe it's due to personal preferences & needs. Overall, it's a decent app just not for me.",
            "I hate that you have to slide to get the numbers instead of just typing it in. Also it will not allow me to enter my food intake for this date. It automatically started at January 1st and when I changed it, it still entered to Jan 1st. Even though the date on the calender was correct.",
            "I do like the app, but it doesn't have a feature to switch to feet/inches of to fl. ounces. I also wish it could connect to google fit, fitbit, and other fitness trackers. If this is fixed then I could in good continuous give this app five stars.",
            "Very systematically efficient app. Algorithms properly arranged. Quality Control at its peak. No chance for complain. Has used different variety of colours in an unique way. Very light-weighted app. Can be easily downloaded with low data speed. Works as an accountant of our body. Gives us the invoice of our body's physical ability. No need to buy expensive smart watches. Just download this app and enjoy!"

            "I'd like to suggest a filter so we could see the recipes that take 5-25 min to prepare. The problem with most people, I believe, is time investment. Eating healthy is easy if you have a cook (or a mom, but since we are adults here, no mom to prep us food). Therefore filtering by time, and main ingredients (someone commented on that as well) would be very useful.",
            "Love the ease of making favorite recipes, and then I can add to my shopping list what I don't have. Wish when scrolling through the recipes it would allow me to swipe instead. Other than this it is great for beginners looking for food ideas. Highly recommend!!",
            "Very good so far. However I don't have a lot of ingredients like almond flour and the like so a way to search recipes by ingredient or group them would be nice. Make starting out a little cheaper rather than buying five different flours that I'll only use once. With that feature I'd give 5 stars and definitely buy the ad free version.",

The initial video is completely misleading and flat out a LIE.",

This feels like just one innocuous, rambling man who just loves to hear himself talk. I see no directions on what to eat, alternating high carb low carb days for endomorphs etc. So far it is an utter disappointment that has me in tears. I got up early to start and was just bombarded with more long extraenous sales pitches. I will try again but if fat cold be burned by listening to him drone on and on, then I would weight 120 pounds.",

I can easily track my progress and Vince and the VShred team guide you very thoroughly throughout each workout. The support is also amazing. If I had a question, I was met with a response very quickly. I love this app! The vshred community is also amazing!",
            "Even though the ads were long, the workouts are easy to follow. I purchased the $ 57 Fat loss that came with other packages for free (which otherwise would cost more than $200) You just have to be patient and watch all the information videos before proceeding to check out, otherwise you might miss a good discount. It's a good community and coaches. Yes it cost money, but it's really worth it. If you want free content for workouts or diets, go to YouTube! Be determined!"

            "Great app! Was super impressed when I reached out and had several emails back and forth. This app was perfect for me because it took all the mental work out of getting healthy. Deciding on a workout routine was intimidating. Eating healthy even more so. Even if I wasn't pairing with a workout, deciding what to eat has always been difficult for me and often resulted in a lot of food waste. Not anymore! I am learning how to cook so much and my diet is tastier than ever actually!",
            "Awesome. This app has everything I need. I can track my weight, meal plan, schedule workouts...and it has stats galore. There is lots of flexibility in the setup, so I can schedule a cheat day each week into my plan. There are plenty of recipes to use, and if you go off-plan you can add things manually. There are loads of features. It's exactly what I was looking for.",
            "App is pretty good, has a lot of features and if you're willing to pay it offers a lot more. I highly recommend his, but 2 stars for the following reasons: the weight doesn't increase weekly by default (at least on the PHAT routine), and it doesn't have T bar or Hex bar as options when substituting for others. Add t bar and hex bar and I'll increase my rating Edit: dev responded and made clarity to all my issues. Highly recommend it",
            "Great structure! I love how much I can customize! There are a variety of options for popular workout routines. Within that I can select my rest days, and choose from a huge database of movements based on my equipment available. By following the routine it is helpful in selection of weight and keeping me on task with appropriate rest time between sets. I want to explore the nutrition/meal component more. It is so cool to have everything in one place. Thank you!",
            "This has been exactly what I've been looking for. The ability to pick from a variety of workout plans, set different goals, meal planner, and the grocery list all in one has been easy to use and makes everything easier and faster for me. A couple things: the food search gets glitchy and there's a delay, and maybe the addition of vegan or no-dairy diet restrictions. Also, am I able to update the days I can work out and the length of time, mid week/routine? Love this app!"

There must b alternate fruit vegetable protein etc if seasonal food cant be find And also mention low calories food Rich protein food And beneficial food during this time I find vegetables day was extra tough for me so there must b some alternate that may n followed... Thanks Over all it good ...👍",

Also needs measurements for the food. Example would be like two cups of watermelon. I will have to start in about two days because I don't gave most of these. Wish it had fish or something other then tofu. Not a fan taste like rubber.",

I think it will help me see what foods might affect my daily functioning. It also time stamps AND allows you to go back and adjust the time stamp. This helps me to see how frequently I'm eating and drinking water and is flexible for other useful data too. I recommend trying it out and seeing for yourself! I hope they update it too.",

There's a copy option that doesn't seem to paste.. Haven't figured out how to use it yet..",

            "If anyone has ever tried the Keto diet, it can be incredibly tough. Finding foods that are low and carbs and taste good was very difficult. I was so close to just stopping the diet because I literally hated almost everything I was eating. Then, it clicked, I bet someone out there had these same thoughts. After looking around I finally found this cookbook. My goodness, this one is a life saver. It has a plethora of different recipes that use SIMPLE ingredients.",
            "Love love love this app. Best one I've come across so far. Every recipe is so easy to follow and that says a lot because I never step foot in the kitchen.. until I started Keto. This app gave me motivation to stick with it. This app has made cooking fun!! AND EASY!",
            "With this app I will have the capacity to cook genuine nourishment amid occupied occasions as opposed to being enticed to get pre-bundled or remove sustenances. I have seen numerous keto apps with such huge numbers of extraordinary fixings that most home cooks don't have. There is nothing more baffling than purchasing heaps of flavors that may be utilized for a solitary formula that I may never make again. The app is extremely efficient and it's extremely simple to discover what you need to cook"

            "As a married couple nearing out late 50s we knew we needed to try something better for our diet. We liked Haylee's diet but trying to keep up with the books was difficult with our busy lives. Then we saw this app and it has made following the diet 10,000 times easier. It has made buying food easier too. We are now the lean couple everywhere we go and our strength has come back. Lifting, hiking and cycling. Great app. So helpful!!! Seriously, so helpful!!!",
            "I first downloaded this app more than 3 years ago. I found it difficult to use then as everything is in imperial and I have been bought up using metric (like most of the world). As I am doing the diet again I have downloaded it again but am frustrated that after all this time, there still isn't an option to use metric measurements instead of imperial. Surely this would be easy to do? It would make it a lot easier to do as I am having to convert everything myself into imperial just to use the app",
            "Recipes would be super helpful. Wish it automatically would repeat times on all days and wish you could export your excel meal plan into the app",
            "Greatly disappointed that this does not have an account to share data between multiple devices. Today's users have multiple devices, and in some circumstances need to use more than one device. This is very inconvenient not being able to access the same info on two, or more device.  In addition, it should have the capability of rotating view.",
            "I've used this app for years on my iPad and finally decided to pay the extra to have it on my phone. Unfortunately, when I try to adjusted the times of meals a white box pops up. On the iPad I know it's a warning about time between meals, but since I cannot clear it on the phone, it makes the app unusable. So disappointed."

            "I had a few glitches with this app, notably when casting to the tv. I like the routines but was dissatisfied that some of the workout classes you couldn't save to use again - apologies if you can, I couldn't work out how! The other issue I had is that like most other apps there is a lot of squat exercises, not good for me, and an alternative is often tricky to find. Sad that so much is only available to subscribers, I haven't renewed for the above reasons, and I'm not interested in the meal plan",
            "I like the classes, but feel sad about not having them available on the weekends. The workouts are good too, but I am still trying to figure out how to create a routine for the week / month, that is complete and balanced. I found this app is not very good at providing that. The previous app I had was very good at setting up a 3 month program and I did not have to figure out what to do everyday, plus I felt I was working towards a more clear and oriented goal.",
            "Great app! Changed my life :) got addicted to online workouts.. Good diversity, awsome trainers, you can choose the workout level and type easily. Highly recommended!!",
            "I've tried alot of apps to help motivate and hold me accountable and 8fit is the only one that has worked for ME! I love that it starts your work outs at the level your at. It has alarms, recipes, and I can log my daily work outs to hold myself accountable. I use the free version right now but will upgrade when I reach my first weight loss goal!",
            "I enjoy this app. It's good for keeping my workouts on a schedule and helps me stay motivated. I can track not just the guided workouts I've done through the app, but also the workouts I do elsewhere. I'm not even using the premium version, either. I likely will get it, though! The classes it offers look good, and being able to access recipes would be great."

But you can use it for nearly anything. I like being able to look at my progress.",

It does all your calculations for you, and gives you really good advice every day. It's super easy to plug in your meals and see how you did/how you're doing. I'm using the free version, and it's still extremely helpful with NO payment :3 I recommend this app to anyone :D",

People these days who need to lose weight already have plenty of ways to do it and plenty of people to go to.

You can choose what unit of weight to use also and what I like is that is has stones and pounds as well as kg.",
            "Great tracker. I have used it on and off for a while and like that it keeps track of weight and measurements over time. I tried the goal feature which shows you where you should be at each week but its hard to keep up with it and can be stressful and frustrating.",
            "No problem just started to use it. Hope it keep track of gains and losses without losing them. Well been using this app for awhile and I very much like it as it tells you if you lost or gained.",
            "I really like this app. It helps me stay focused on my weight loss. I've lost 17lb so far ,with more to go. The app let's you set up short term goals and your long term goal. The graphs let you see your trend on weigh loss and estimated date on your short and long term goals. I love checking it and see my progress. I haven't be this weight in 12 years. I was finally motavated to loss weight and this app is a great aid."

I tap them multiple times, nothing happens! I've rebooted my phone, there are no memory issues, it's just that the app is clearly dysfunctional. Don't bother installing this.",

From there it could be used to make adjustments within the remaining meals and snacks, so that the caloric, fat, etc figures stay reasonably close to the same. To note changes in an item, a smaller portion or a new recipe used, would also help. Making notes works, but isn't ideal.",

            "I have not had a chance to use this app but 1 time and I mean only flipped through a couple of screens, and suddenly trying to back out of a screen Im asked to rate the app before I can exit out. The rate the app question is very premature. I read some of the complaints on here about this very same issue. thought it was trivial, but then it happened to me. I shouldn't be forced to rate your app. Just like you can't force people to buy or use services.",
            "I am a type 1 Diabetic on an insulin pump and I need to lose some weight and get my blood sugars better under control. my A1C is 6.9 right now and that has been the highest I have ever been and I am not happy with that number. This diet is going to help me reach my goal of getting better blood sugars and lose some unwanted weight. I have tryed pretty much ever diet out there but this one is going to be my saving grace.",
            "This app is looking for feedback before you even get a chance to go through the various modules. Gave it a 3 but i really won't know for a while.",
            "As I've just been told im type 2 insulin dependant diabetic. I've found this app more informative than all the others. It tells you what you can/can't eat. Also what you should eat once every day and how much. From a selection of foods. it explains about the portion sizes. The diabetic nurse just sent myself off with a booklet. To be honest its made my outlook a bit better now"

What's Not cool: \" You can't pinch in/out zoom to read some sections (shopping list, food list) bc they are in in PDF format. * There are no sample recipies. * Two sections have deep colors (Red, Blue) & the text is hard to make out.",
            "So. The recipes are good. It even includes macros count. What's missing for me is a daily food logger - maybe you could add from the recipes list. Also, more recipes would be great. Lastly, it could use a paid option to get rid of the ads.",
            "I feel scammed, after downlaoding your app I clicked on the keto diet square, the next page offered a 28 day meal plan, I continued to click on it and it offered it for $35, I thought it was part of the app so I paid thinking this would help me get started on a keto meal plan. So of course I recieved no meal plan, but I did get charged You should not have full page ad pop ups right after clicking on your app options. That is very misleading. Needless to say I've uninstalled your app.",
            "I really enjoy this app. One stop shop to get info and recipes. I am a full time working mom with 4 children. I really wish there was a way to save favorite recipes into a seperate folder. Right now I have to write them down which becomes time consuming. Then I'll give 5 stars",
            "This is so far the most useful app i have come accross. Suggestions of various kind of ketogenic diet recipes and meal plan. It also very easy to understand and follow. They give useful diet tips and information on other diets and health info too"

In addition to the diet we always have a nutritional protein with greens smoothie/shake in the morning and before bed. One teaspoon each maca powder, wheat grass powder, spirulina powder, and one tablespoon raw organic cocao powder in almond milk.",
            "Military diet is only for over weight people. How much you lose depends greatly on your bmr (height, weight, age, and gender). For instance, if you were a 27 year old, height: 5'11\", weight: 200, and gender: male. Then your normal calorie intake to maintain your weight will be 1900 calories a day. 1900-1400= 500 calories, so you will lose 500 calories a day of real fat with no exercise. If your weight drops more than 1 pound in a week then that extra is what you call water weight.",
            "I thought I was getting a military diet but I was sorely mistaken! No where in this diet did I eat 9000 calories worth of MRE's nor did I shovel a piled high plate of food in my mouth in under 10min and not defecate for a week! Nothing about chain smoking, dipping, or drinking coffee and monsters until my heart explodes. Worst part is no dirt bag terrorist tried poisoning my food or attempted to drop bombs on my head as I ate.",

Not only is the layout easy to follow but it also includes helpful tips and explanations behind why some lost more than others so you're not making the same critical mistakes. I have lost 8lbs during my 3 days and an additional 2lbs up to my day 6. For those of you who are trying this, this is a week long diet. The 3 days set you up for a successful week and depending on your choices for days 4-7 you can get maximum results!"

        "description": "Low-calorie recipes app is the best place where you can find the best fitness recipes. For a successful weight loss goal, you need to eat foods having low calories.\r\n\r\nMost diets involve reducing calories in some way or another. Some introduce foods that fill you up faster but contain fewer calories, such as fruits and vegetables in place of processed foods. Other diets restrict your options, and eating the same food sources becomes repetitive and less interesting, so you consume fewer items. Still, other diets combine both strategies, such as diets recommending a low-calorie food such as a tomato, or a special shake that you make, for most or all of your meals. But new research shows that low-calorie diets can help with surprisingly more than your weight.\r\n\r\nA low-calorie diet is one that restricts your intake to 1200 to 1600 calories per day for men, and 1000 to 1200 calories per day for women. Some people go on a very low-calorie diet for rapid weight loss, often consuming only 800 calories a day. This type of diet usually includes special foods such as shakes and soups to replace meals and for added vitamins. Very low-calorie diets can help a person achieve a weight loss of up to 3 to 5 pounds per week.\r\n\r\nFor weight loss, most people should consider a low-fat diet rather than a very low-calorie diet. Less extreme diets are easier to follow. They interrupt normal daily activities less and are less risky if you're over 50 or have other health problems. Also, gallstones have been reported in people who go on very-low-calorie diets. Keep in mind that most diets only work when you make healthy lifestyle choices at the same time. Including increasing daily exercise and reducing your sedentary time throughout the day.\r\n\r\nLOW CALORIE APP EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nOur app is simple to navigate and also has multiple tutorials available on how to use the app.\r\nAs the recipe is a set of instructions for cooking, our app also provides nutritional information, servings, total time for preparation and recommendations so that nothing can go wrong when you’re cooking.\r\n\r\nTheme Support\r\n\r\nProtect your eyes from being hurt by a bright screen at night by enabling dark mode.\r\nMake your night cooking experience more comfortable at low light.\r\n\r\nSmart Shopping List for your Grocery Needs\r\n\r\nAn organized shopping list allows the user to create ingredients list so you won’t miss any for the recipe. Users can also add items directly from recipes.\r\nIt also has offline access.\r\n\r\nSearch 1M+ Low Calorie Recipes\r\n\r\nApart from shopping list our app also provides a global search feature\r\nwhere you can find best recipes you looking for or discover new recipes\r\n\r\nCollect Your Favorite Low-Calorie Recipes\r\n\r\nUse our bookmark button to save and organize your loved recipes in your favorite recipe list.

Some quantities missing in recipes ( eg: Salad Sandwich: avocado/ cheese/ etc..how much??), so unsure how carbs given can possibly be accurate. Uses oz/ lbs ( non metric) so lost if using in Australia etc..Typos in recipe headers also shows this app was rushed. \" sparagus\"? etc..\" HOME\" menu option doesn't seem to work? Needs revision. Nice try.",
            "Android users were the last to have the diet doctor keto recipes app. As much as I like the idea that I can now access recipes. I find the app to be a bit boring. It's not very planned due to the fact that it doesn't have any meal plan access, nor can one see any nutrients facts. Hopefully there'll be more to this app. Thanks for your understanding.",
            "Good and easy recipes. I am giving only 2* because: there's no way to SAVE your recipes and there's no way to SHARE them. Also takes long open and asks for 5 stars. Please fix it and you'll get 5*. The app has great potential but now is somewhat annoying to use! I'm happy to pay for ads-free version with regular features like saving and sharing.",
            "This app has been great so far! It's simple, relatively user friendly, and there are lots of recipes to choose from. There are, however, a couple of suggestions I'd like to make. Firstly, it would be nice to have the option to save recipes for later. Secondly, it would be useful if the recipes could be ordered by level of difficulty."

The diet is a very popular regimen, and has worked for many. \r\n\r\nWhat we like about this diet : Most weight loss diets get pretty complicated, lengthy and often require that you not only weigh and measure all your food but also buy a big list ingredients that take a ton of time to prepare. Let's be honest: Many diets also include supplements that are often more expensive than real food! Needless to say, this is not a good way to encourage diet compliance. The three day military diet is short and it’s easy. Not to mention, very effective for quick weight loss.\r\n\r\nPack your refrigerator with our grocery list before starting so that you don’t have to get stressed out what foods to eat. This makes the dieting easier.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n- Military Diet Full Menu Day 1\r\n- Military Diet Full Menu Day 2\r\n- Military Diet Full MenuDay 3\r\n- Information on the Diet\r\n- Diet Tips\r\n- Food Substitutions\r\n- Grocery List\r\n- Note Tool for personal notes\r\n\r\nMotivation is what gets you started!\r\nThe diet may make you feel hungry and weak because it is a low-calorie plan, however the military diet is said to be able to help you lose weight very quickly. If you’re looking to lose some pounds very quickly for an upcoming occasion or a wedding event, then the super military diet plan is the best weight loss plan for you.\r\n\r\nExercising will help you lose more weight compared to just diet alone. But, it is only advised to start heavy workouts during the phase II, as you’ll be having less strength on the first 3 days due to low calorie consumption. However, you can do regular jogging, walking or running along with some yoga and meditation during the phase I.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for long term results, then you should not follow the 3 day military diet (or any diet program for that matter). The best way to lose weight and maintain it is by changing your lifestyle (healthy eating habits). It is the only recommended way to stay fit for a longer period of time.",

            "Very well done! I went ahead and paid for the premium version, so I am reviewing that version. I love the animated examples, the tips during the workout, the voice coaching , the timers. The beginners workout is very doable for someone who is obese like me. However, as doable as it was I really broke a sweat! I also loved that it gives you the option to repeat your work out or stop, and then gives you a fitness tip at the end. I will recommend this app to my fitness class.",
            "Really love this app, try to use it every day. The 30 day challenge really mixes it up every day to make sure you work your whole body over the week. The reminders are really handy to make sure you dont skip a day too!",
            "Best app for beginners but I preferred the old version. The man is smaller and is now off at an angle rather than facing me. It motivates me if I can face him and copy him buy he isnt directly facing me anymore. Also the countdown clock is too small now.",

        "description": "The Military Diet Plan is one of the most well-known diets. Although it is called the Military Diet Plan,  it has nothing to do with the military and does not follow the principles used in the actual military. It is called so as it is really strict and it requires persistence when the going gets tough. \r\n\r\nIt involves a 3 day diet plan, follow by a 4 days off meal plan. Rather than calories burned, the Military Diet focuses on significant calorie deficits by cutting out the amount and types of food that you eat. \r\n\r\nThis extremely low-calorie diet is designed to help you to lose a lot of weight in a short amount of time. Fastening will make your insulin more sensitive. Not only that, this diet will boost your metabolism as you will eat a lot of protein that takes more calories to burn. Also, you will be eating a lot of dietary fiber that fights your food cravings. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of using the Military Diet Plan is it is practically free: There is no need to buy expensive diet plan books or supplements. The food in this plan is also affordable and easy to find in any grocery store.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary Diet Plan Features :\r\n- Introduction\r\n- Tips For This Diet\r\n- Advantages\r\n- Side-Effects\r\n- Meal Plan\r\n    - Shopping List\r\n    - Food Substitutions\r\n    - Non-Vegetarian Meal Plan\r\n    - Vegetarian & Vegan Meal Plan\r\n    - 4 Days Off Menu\r\n- Frequent Asked Questions\r\n- Disclaimer\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAL PLAN :\r\n\r\nThe Military Diet Plans menu for its 3 days plan is very simple, all you need are:\r\n\r\nCaffeinated coffee or tea, one grapefruit, two bananas, two apples, whole-wheat bread, peanut butter, eggs, three cans of tuna, hot dogs, a small piece of meat, green beans (fresh, frozen, or canned), small head of broccoli, carrots, saltine crackers, cottage cheese, a small amount of cheddar cheese, vanilla ice cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTIONS :\r\n\r\nIn case you cannot take certain food listed in the Military Diet Plan menu for various personal reasons, food substitutions are listed to help you with other options of food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- 4 DAYS OFF PLAN :\r\n\r\nFor the best results on the Military Diet, we advise following a diet of 1500 calories or less on your days off. An average man/woman burns more than 1500 calories per day. To be specific, an average male burns about 2100 calories per day, while the female burns around 1800 calories. So, when you’re following the 1500 calorie meal plan, your body is likely to burn the extra fat stored in your body to compensate for the missing calories, thereby helping you lose weight naturally. Pick and choose from a 4 day off meal plan from your Military Diet. Choose one breakfast, one lunch, one dinner and two snacks for an approximate 1500 calorie per day diet plan.",

Weight loss is made more difficult when you have a ton of emotional baggage like I have. Having the facts - the actual numbers - in front of me helps me stay on track. I also must mention the scanner. It is wonderful!",
            "App works great. Fairly easy to learn and use. Would be 5 stars if it showed a total daily macros on a pie chart instead of a huge layout form that is very difficult to read and quite useless. Like the diabetes carb count, that is most useful to me. Would also like to know how to delete self created recipes but help section isn't very helpful and doesn't explain how. Love the huge database with many foods I use and happy with how easy and quick it is to add the odd new food that isn't there."

There is no \"total\" option for the end of the day tally, so I improvise and put the total in another option. I can also track my weight, my total water intake for the day and any exercise done. I do wish I had the option to get the app without ads, though. Every other app was too complex for my needs.",

            "The app itself is quite useful as a simple tracker, but the ads are obnoxious. Also, I swiched it at some point from kilograms to pounds, and it really messed up the conversion. (It converted my kg to lb - so 50 kg becomes 110lb - then called those kg, so that that was originally 50kg became 110kg, or 240lb. Didn't do the same when switching back, however. So my now 240lb converted back to 110kg. For my entire history.)",

I tried exporting it, but the file I chose didn't have enough space. So I tried to export it somewhere else but it won't let me switch it to a different location. All my other app's data saved effortlessly because I just signed back in. Very frustrating.",

However, it's full of bugs and almost useless because of it. :'( I tried to enter calories for a day, and it switched to the day before or two days before.

For example, I enter my height as 5 ft 6 ins, and the app changes it to 5ft 5ins no matter how many times I amend it. It also amends the weight entry. I would like to be able to pay a small amount to get rid of ads (if that's an option I haven't found it) and a visual representation of weight loss would be a nice touch.",
            "I found the app easy to use. The only fault for me is when I put my weight in it changes to just below or just above what I have put in. It's only by an oz but its still annoying. Otherwise its great for keeping on track.",
            "It helped me easily achieve my target rate. I logged my calories and weight over a number of weeks and will continue to use this to maintain my ideal weight."

I love it!",

            "Postive: Good to track intermittent fasting hours. Keeps you honest and its good to have a visual countdown. You can also set your own personal goal eg 13hrs. Negative: Can be hard to navigate. LOTS of ads, which are frustrating, including asking me to rate the app. My response to your reply (copied below) is: My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without responding to your review requests. Your response to my feedback - you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5 stars. I've now decreased it. Your reply - Hi Carolyn, the ads keep the app free, but you can remove them for a extra small amount (one cup of coffee). Also by rating the app, you help us to acquire more users which can increase our budget for new free cool features :D If you can consider to give us a 5 star review, could be awesome, thanks. My point is it's frustrating that you can't use the app without loads of ads and responding to your review requests. Your response... you ask me to increase my rating of your app to 5stars.",
            "A bit heavy on the ads, but I do expect ads on the free version. Otherwise, this app has everything I've been looking for for fasting tracking. Love that it let's me track all my measurements along with weight. Can measure glucose and ketone levels if I want. I've been fasting for a while and wanted to find an app that would let me enter old fasts. It could be smoother for allowing this, but it does let me edit times and dates for my fasts so I've been able to enter old fasts. Can customize too!",
            "Easy to log info and clear displays. I like the idea of choice of time counting upward or count down. Developer even replied to my previous rating to explain my mistake. Now gave 5 stars as I've tried others and there's more adverts or have to pay. This app is the best in my opinion.",
            "Not a bad fasting app, but the BMI calculator is wrong. I like that you can track body measurements, but it would be nice if they added a female body. Edit to add- my units are all correct. Looking again, it looks like the app IS showing the right number at the top of the screen, but the graph is showing it 6 units higher",
            "It doesn't freeze up and it tells you what your body is suppose to be doing at certain levels. But, I'm not sure how to share this app with other faster. I've tried and I just don't see it."

        "recentChanges": "Welcome to the all new Stupid Simple Paleo version 6! We&#39;ve redesigned the app from the ground up, making it faster, more reliable, and easier to use. You can now share your progress and foods with friends and family too. The piggy bank is now a rolling 30 day bank that updates dynamically when you add/remove food in the past OR resets at the beginning of each month. The choice is yours! This minor update fixes an incompatibility with our Macros app.",
        "comments": [
            "Great little app that does exactly what it says it does. Easy interface with awesome icons and graphics. It does need calorie expenditure for workouts though. Or at least I haven't found it yet. Still worth every cent for the add free version.",
            "Just amazing! Tried a few apps but this one beats them all. Truly thank the developers. Gives you full control of the breakdown of your diet (% macros) and a tailored goal. Once you add items it automatically deducts from your daily goal so you can plan ahead. Stupid simple indeed. Tip my hat to you guys",
            "Great app. It makes it easy to keep track of what you are eating with barcode scanning and quickly searchable lists of foods. You can carry your own recipes easily and then add them to your day while changing portion size on the fly. It is simple to set the macro balances that you want as well. The only real improvement would be that it would be nice to be able to access a report of your micronutrients as well. Although that isn't as important as easy access to your macro's.",
            "once I figured out how to use the app, it has been amazing. I wish there were step by step directions on what each thing is and how to use it, such as the calorie bank. I was able to find the answer on Google. there is probably still more to this app that I am not aware of. the next question on this asks if we can import recipes. I'm not aware of being able to do that but I will definitely be asking Google",
            "App is basically useless unless you buy the premium version. None of the features work in the \"free\" version and every time you attempt to use one you're simply prompted with an \"upgrade to premium\" ad. Don't waste your time downloading this."

It's just so easy to use, yet very comprehensive, very user friendly. I've used it for 6 weeks now and look lo and behold, I'v lost 6 pounds! And it doesn't even feel like an effort. The app has also really helped me switch to a ketogenic diet, and being able to track the percentages of carbs, fat and proteins i eat has been really instrumental in this.",
            "I usually don't do ratings, but I've been using Poundaweek for over a year & it works well. I like how you can create your own meals, & the free app is quite customizable. Plus the ads are MUCH less intrusive than other apps. Would like it to have a larger list of branded items.",
            "This app is simple and colourful. It sets a 1 week target for you and displays your progress in a bar chart. I prefer this to the My Fitness Pal app which relied on me making my own fitness plan and constantly reminded me to enter my meals. Poundaweek has made me realise that if I have a \"bad\" day or don't lose weight one week, I haven't failed. Only 4 stars because I'd like more UK foods to be in its catalogue. I'd also like a holiday feature so you could skip days during Xmas etc.",
            "I love this app even though I hate the thought of counting calories. It helped me lose 66 pounds and stay normal bmi for 2 years. Time to restart again after weight gain from the lockdowns. I don't understand the calculation of fat vs. protein percentage since I am eating more grams of protein than fat and the percentage of protein is reported as lower instead of higher. I wish someone would review the programming for the calculation...otherwise, love the app!",
            "I found it really easy to add food. I find it annoying to change color features i have to buy the app. So I don't bother with any of the extras. I dont like its auto adjusting my food calories. Lame."

            "Just begun using it I like the history where you can just pick a previous meal, so you don't need to input each meal. I like it great so far. Think the portions need to be more flexible as 1 serving of raw food like sliced onions hard to judge if it's a portion or not. Just a small gripe tho",
            "Great, would recommend. Only problem is the icon is not super sharp, and might be out of date for the new icon shape design Google updated. Other than that, it looks good and polished within the app",
            "Great data base, but few bugs. Like the barcode that won't work until rebooting the app and the today's planning that get all empty when starting the app. Also it's just an historic of my meals, it would be great to prepare them in advance for the coming weeks.",
            "I'm pretty new to be rating this app, but I like what it is bringing to the table. I'm using the premium version and thought the price was low enough to pick up the extra features of menus and advice. Content is very helpful. Taking a photo and getting feedback is innovative and I think will be stronger as more people use. Having issues with font size in database being a bit large to see full descriptions. Seeing a lot of potential!",
            "Unless you're sure you want to pay for the whole year, go ahead with the supposedly \"7-day Free trial\". They will charge you at the moment of the subscription to the trial. I contacted Foodvisor support and Play Google, and neither validated my complaint. It is highly deceiving for users to tell they can try the app but charge them the full amount right away. I don't know how Google allows this type of practice."

The main difference between a regular low carb diet plan and a keto diet plan is the amount of carbohydrates and proteins allowed on a daily basis.

Most people start a ketogenic diet because they want to lose weight fast and consistently. However, scientific research suggests that ketosis goes further than that, such as lowering your blood pressure, risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, improving skin conditions and dental health, mood stabilization, and increasing energy levels.\r\n\r\nMyKeto = A Keto Diet Guide, Keto Macro Calculator & Low Carb Diet Tracker :\r\nTable of Contents:\r\n-Basics: Zero to Low-Carb, High Fat, Moderate to High Protein – Dropping into Ketosis.\r\n-Benefits: Backed by scientific studies, not by fad homeopathic guru practitioners.\r\n-Side-Effects: Yes, a low carb keto diet is not completely awesome.\r\n-Debunk Myths: Large amounts of fat, especially saturated fat, can’t be healthy, right?

            "Reached my goal size for the 1st time EVER at age 67 even though I was unable to walk, needing knee replacement. I maintained easily doing. Dr.Bergs Healthy Keto. (Google it) I have not paid for any keto programs or special supplements, a few drug store Vit.s. Life threw me off track, so now I am back on board. This app is helping me do Keto with only healthy fats, loads of greens. Free from Fibromyalgia and Arthritis pain. I expect to be back to maintenance within 2 months. YOU GOT THIS!",
            "A simple accurate app to use.",
            "This is a great app. I've tried other apps and this one far surpasses them for ease of use, number of features and NO ads. I love it!",
            "It looks good, but unfortunately you have to buy to try. That's too risky to me as there are too many duds out there. Should give at least a week trial.",
            "Excellent app. I have been using this app for 2 + years now. It allows me to set my own goals and adjust them over time as my needs change. It has a extensive library of fresh and packaged foods (scanning or key in) plus the ability to create my personal meals for quick one click addition for daily tracking. With the added ability to track water, blood glucose, weight, ketones, exercise, etc. plus add personal notes, this has proven to be an indispensable tool. If only I could perform as well."
