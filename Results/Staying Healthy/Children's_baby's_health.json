            "Had to update the rating to 2 stars. Data sync needs to be improved between multiple users logged into an account. There have been several times that my husband and I have lost hours and sometimes even a day of data because we're both logged into the same account. Original review: Love the app, but it has sync issues between mine and my husband's phones. It's caused some data to be lost at times. If data syncing is improved, this app would be 5 stars.",
            "I use this app daily. I track my babies breastfeeding, sleep and nappies over everything else, I'm very forgetful so it helps a lot to keep myself on track. I don't like the food tracker at all. Instead of grams it should just allow you to enter the food item(s) the babe eats, like apples, bananas, chicken or so on. I do think that they are always posting some really helpful and fun little articles to read. It has its flaws, but it's still a very good app.",
            "Like the app overall but I don't like with new updates when I am breastfeeding I can not adjust or add older feeds even if they belong to another day showing me the message \"the session conflicts with active timer\" when actually it does not. Also there should be a limit time tracking of 3 hours... sometimes if i forget to \"stop\" and later can't add a feed I have the tracker still on counting for over 10 hours...",
            "I love the app but the syncing doesn't work. We've lost feeding tracking because it doesn't sync properly. I'll close out of the app, he goes in and tracks something, then he'll log out (as suggested) and I'll log in after a few minutes and it doesn't show up. My device is the only one that will track properly and show on both devices. It's sorta frustrating 😔",
            "Great tracking app. I like that you are able to pause the timers. There are so many things that you can track or make note of, which is great. I also really enjoy the articles.Not sure if there is dark mode as I can't find it butit would be great if there was. When you are trying to track while baby is asleep the bright light causes him to squirm.,"

            "I played this game when I was younger! I found this game on play store and downloded it. The reason why I gave it 4 stars because first, you have to watch an ad to get some of the baby's stuff. I got used to it at first but then it became very iritating. Second, the shoes and toys aren't even free you have to pay money for them. If the game gets updated again with the free shoes and toys, I'll put the 1 star back. Thanks for reading! :)",
            "This is the best game ever I love it but you have to have certain stuff but you have to have internet access and stuff so for that it's not that fun but it's fun especially if you have Internet it's fine also when you are like in a truck and you can play it wherever you go except for if your phone dies or your tablet or your Chromebook I guess or your computer bye",
            "I loved this game ever since I was small. But I also found some disadvantages. They have many ads and that was ao disturbing. Then we needed money 💰 for some another stuff. But other things in this game is absolutely fun! And the music too. Now this game is my sister's favourite game",
            "It was a very nice game when I was 5 years old today I am 12 years old I installed the game from play store yesterday then I saw,I have to pay money for some things.. If this game will change into old version so I will give 1 more star thank u for reading:)",
            "😍I played this very long time ago I loved it and I was five years old when I played this game it was fun and I'm 9 now and I still play it it's fun I was used to the ads I don't remember much but I love making food for the baby it's so much fun and I love the person who made this app it's so much fun and I'm not sure if I remember this but I love it ❤️"

            "Great app for my almost 2 yrs old boy. We limit the usage of this game but while he plays with it I love that he can't back up but God bless his intelligence, he learned how to switch games! Lol Love that is ad-free game. Enjoy it folks while it's free.",
            "My 2yr old loves this game. And I love that she can't back out accidentally, you have to hold the X and drag it across the top of the screen before it will back out. Great feature for tap happy fingers, lol! She loves the fruit smash. Great spacing for lil hands, speed is just slow enough for her to be able to get all the fruit. And she loves the lil bear that pops up to cheer her on.",
            "There's something missing.. this app is almost perfect, only thing missing is coloring. Add coloring, simple, one color pictures, like on the baby's first words part, the pictures should be available to color. Also I would recommend a simple little reward program, like stickers or toys you can collect for successfully completing tasks or missions. But overall, great work.",
            "Love this app already. Very colourful and visually appealing for my 2yo son. I love all the options and that you can change the pace as well as download everything for free for a wider array of options. I already love the company and their mission to give wonderful educational apps, ad free and without any in app purchases whatsoever! I wish I found this sooner instead of having to go through all the \"free\" educational apps that have ads that a little one can easily click. Highly recommend.",
            "My cousin lives it! He likes to play with our phones and this is great! He can't buy anything, accidentally leave, and the choices are great! I also enjoy how he can't change the settings because there is a number lock, but if a child has this on their phone or tablet they easily could! This is awesome for my cousin that I have now and I am sure it is going to be for ones on the way! Thank you so much for this great app!!"

            "Great App Needs Minor tweaks !! App would get 5 stars if the app gave a daily,weekly,monthly summary of feedings. And If it gave a daily average of feedings time length. Also it would be great to get a weekly,monthly average of diaper changes to track stool progress and urine. And it would be great to set feeding time alarms for scheduled breast or bottle feedings.",
            "App doesn't allow you to track both breastfeeding and bottle feeding. If you enter bottle information, the next time you use the breastfeeding timer, the bottle info is deleted. Defeats the purpose of tracking feeding if you can't track feeds when mom is away too.. Would be 5 star app if this was fixed.",
            "Very helpful app! I too would appreciate a daily summary of feeding time, nappy changes etc. Also, I breastfeed both my children and the app doesn't allow me to record one child's feeding while feeding the other. Other than that, can't imagine parenting without Ovia :)",
            "Disappointed in this app after loyal use of Ovia Fertility and Pregnancy apps. This one crashed often, and also failed to save data several times (and I KNOW I entered it!). Tracking data (feeding, diapers, etc.) is important for newborns, especially when mom is sleep deprived. This app just isn't reliable.",
            "I really enjoyed using the \"Fertility\" & \"Pregnancy\" version of the Ovia app, but unfortunately they missed the mark for the \"Parenting\" version...there are not enough features/tabs included to record data or use as a daily tracker (would like to be able to track bath, growth, vaccines, teeth, activities, Dr. visits, symptoms, meds, etc.). I only use this app to track milestones & I have to use another app to record daily activities."

            "I love this app, how it helps me remember which breast my baby ate from last, how long ago her last bath was, and keeping track of how many diapers we go through. I also like the growth chart. However it doesnt always pull up right away on my phone. I often have to click on it 4 or 5 times before it pulls up with NO other apps working in the background. It is quite annoying sometimes",
            "The sync is horrible, which doesn't help when you wakeup in the middle of the night and can't see what you S.O fed the baby. Or when the babies sleep actually started. My favorite is how becauses of these glitches and sleep deprivation we get to fight over who didnt properly sync the app on a routine basis. I don't know how something important is so poorly executed.",
            "After trying Huckleberry, Glow, and Baby Tracker, we decided Baby Daybook was the best app for us. It has basically every feature you could want, the design is good, the free version is excellent, and the premium version is priced right. Beyond that it has features nobody else does: excellent voice integration through Google Assistant (yell at your phone to record diapers while changing baby!) and a really awesome interactive notification for ongoing feeds & naps. Great multi-user support too.",
            "Love this app! My husband can know what our baby is doing while at work and I can keep up with breastfeeding! I've also found that this app can be useful with my 3 yr old as well as my two teenage kids! Super easy to use. I would like more options to track things or even to make up my own opinions to track things.",
            "The functionality of the app is outstanding. The sync features worked very well for few days. The use of Google Assistant was so easy and helped us a lot. But after about a week of usage, the sync went haywire and doest sync at all giving all sorts of problems. I might even have lost lots of data due to this sync problem. Edit: the Baby Daybook team responded immediately and noticed that the problem is with network connection. I just had to sync between caregivers on data connection first."

My baby is now a few months old and I can honestly say that there have been very few days when I haven't opened the app. The availability of advice from the pros and from other mothers is so helpful especially when you're stuck in a rut not knowing what to do/think as a parent/parent-to-be. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. I'd be lost without it. Well done to the creators.",

It has gave me advice i haven't found else where and for the first day. I haven't been sick! I am so grateful for this app. Its videos for every week are to die for 🥰😍",
            "So I do really really like this App for get me wrong, the only thing that I feel is missing is a symptom tracker, and appointment reminders. Things that I did see other apps offer but I personally did not like the community in those apps as much as this one. So for that I give 4 stars if there as an update later on I will gladly change my review to 5 stars and will happily promote this app to my trying friends.",
            "Love this app, it has so much info to offer and it's so helpful. I'll even google questions and the answer will sometimes pop up in this app which is really beneficial. It has a great support system as well to help you along you journey. It shows you week by week how your baby is growing and just so much information I highly recommend!",
            "This is my favourite pregnancy tracker. It's like watching baby grow week to week. You can connect with other expectant moms. There are lots of helpful tips and articles on diet, relationships, and more. I have recommended it to my friends."

            "Gets the job done, but can be slow to sync. When my husband and I hand off the baby, we use the app to know when the last diaper change and bottle feed happened. Sometimes there's a delay in the sync and I'm left wondering. He has an iPhone and I have an Android. We each purchased the pro upgrade because the free version only lets you sync the data across devices a couple of times a day. There are other tracking features, like sleep and medication that we don't need yet, but we might.",
            "This app is amazing for people with a newborn! Track feeding, diapers, sleeping, baths, measurements, medicines, etc. I would strongly encourage purchasing the premium version. It's reasonably priced, gets rid of the ads, and gives the option to have multiple phones sync in real time. My wife and I both have the app and it allows us to keep one complete record, regardless of if my wife entered the record on her phone, or I entered on mine.",
            "This app is great! I was able to pull it out at my baby's first checkup and give the doc exact numbers of wet/soiled diapers per day 😄 The breastfeeding tracker means I don't have to remember which side I hit last (and it helps me determine if I need to revisit the same side after a short session). Plus they have all sorts of nifty ways to represent the data you input, like daily summaries, weekly averages, heat maps and more!",
            "Don't expect to get a response from their customer service. I used the paid version app for my older son and really liked it! I had created a second profile for my younger son and was happy again until the app somehow malfunctioned. My younger son's profile changed to an exact copy of my older sons profile. I lost all of my 7 month old's data. I've tried reaching out to customer service but have not received a response. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this app!",
            "I really like this app. I would give it a give but for two reasons: the missing apostrophes and logging food via a stopwatch. I would like the option of either using a stopwatch or just recording the time. I don't like that the stopwatch is the default and only option (times can be recorded via the edit feature)."

It’s very helpful to track everything and get a quick glance to remind you the last time you did it, or the next time you have to. It will definitely give you a peace of mind and make your day that much easier to have a log to check whenever needed.\r\n\r\nIt’s extremely important to track when you had your last feeding session, but also track the weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re eating properly and gaining weight at a normal rate.\r\n\r\nAlso, keeping track of diapers is very imperative to keeping your baby healthy. All moms definitely need an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers. Not to mention, you should definitely track if everything looks normal during diaper changes. \r\n\r\nFor some parents, it’s very important to track every ounce of food and keep track of all information. Some babies, unfortunately, have minor illnesses after coming home from the hospital. Keeping track of all this information will help your baby on the road to recovery much more seamlessly.\r\n \r\nAs a new mom, don’t forget to care for yourself as well.

            "It's really useful as it let's me track my newborn diaper changes and feedings along with my husband! Only 1 thing that would be really useful: sometimes the phone falls while I'm feeding my baby and I've accidentally deleted data from it. A confirm option before deleting something would be great!",
            "The new update is really bad. The statistics are messed up.. the day and night sleep do not add up correctly. The sleep bar graph shows a different value for number of hours the the baby has slept and the summary shows a different value. Summary would say 13hrs 22 mins and bargraph shows 14hrs 7 mins.. Really bad.. same for feeds too.. the duration doesn't show the proper converted time.. summary would say 1hr 46 mins.. and bar graph would show up 1.6hrs..",
            "It's pretty useful, except for some issues with sync. Few suggestions. 1. Have a widget that shows the next potential feeding time based on user selectable interval. 2. The selection of time in the all tabs is common. It should be retained even if user has selected in one Tab and then moved on to another. 3. For those who are doing a combination of breastfeeding and bottle feeding (or bottle feeding formula and EBM), there should be a way to add both measurements as a single entry.",
            "Great app! My only problem is the picture set for my baby's profile. I haven't been able to change it because it will only let me use the camera or a couple photo editing apps for some reason. I would like to be able to use pictures from my gallery. But as I was messing with some app setting, the picture I had set disappeared and now I can't set another because I can't get to my phone's gallery :(",
            "After the last update the sleep tracking became very weird and hard to follow."

            "Really like the app, easy to use and lots of information. Would be nice if it would tell you what food groups/nutrients should be given more or less often according to the information you input into it.",
            "I can't believe I payed for this. Limited function for a paid app. There's a graph for the food groups but only shows a week at a time? Useless information for a week's worth. Food groups are misrepresented, meats should be counted as fat and protein as well as some other dual foods. Also, when adding a meal, it defaults to the first day of the week instead of the present day so I wasted my time adding the same meal several times. I could go on but for character limit.",
            "I use this app to keep track of what baby likes to eat and when. So the calendar function is important but the default view is per week. Is there a way to track by day, instead of per week? I find myself having to make sure that I enter my notes on the correct day.",
            "Pretty basic. But works fine if you want to track what you've been feeding",
            "Basic features are fine, I paid for this app hoping to unlock more features but was rather disappointed. I wish I have the option to key in the amount per meal per ingredient (x Tbs), can copy and paste meal (since most of us give the same thing to baby for 3 consecutive days to test allergy reactions), and able to change the meal name (to time for example) instead of using the 5 standard names ie breakfast, am snack, lunch, etc."

            "Great tips and activities when I can get in. Logging in every day is an absolute pain. I hate it. It takes multiple attempts if I can get in at all. I bought the lifetime subscription and can't even use it half the time because I can't get in. I don't have time to just sit waiting to be logged in. Everything else about the app is great but I refuse to recommend it until the login is fixed. I have a high end phone and fast wifi, the issue is not on my end.",
            "Really love this app while I got the free trial. I really wish the app didn't cost money. Me and my daughter really loved it. I just can't see spending the money on it.",
            "Each time I open it, it asks to login even though I have given remember me option. and it takes forever to log in. very slow even in good Wi-Fi connection. but I love the tips it gives each day. Even though it's just one activity per day for the free version I still like that and excited to see it every morning. Two stars less for the slow thing.",
            "LOVE THIS APP! It's so convenient and efficient for me to keep tabs on my baby's emerging milestones and achievements. They break it down into months and categories as well so this app is truly a God send. If anything, it would be great if they didn't remove the milestones from the previous months because my baby doesn't hit all the milestones every month and honestly, I don't remember all of them so it'll be good to be able to look back for reference.",
            "The app is nice in the beginning and gives lots of inexpensive activities and this is around the time they ask you to rate it. Then after a few days it locks all activities, but 1 peek-a-boo activity and they ask you to buy the rest for $5 a month. Becomes useless as a free app at this point."

        "description": "How to Develop Your Baby's Brain\r\n\r\nBabies are one of nature's most perfect learning machines. They absorb information with every passing second, and by engaging with them often, you can encourage the development of your baby's brain. Shower them with affection, and talk with them often. By helping them interact with the world, you are helping them absorb as much information as you can.\r\n\r\nHow to Support Your Baby's Development\r\n\r\nHaving a baby can be an exciting and challenging experience. You want to do everything right to help your baby develop into a healthy and happy toddler, and eventually a happy, productive adult. You may be wondering, however, what you can do to help your baby progress as they should. You can support your baby’s development if you promote mental growth, boost physical development, and encourage social and emotional learning.\r\n\r\nHow to Make a Baby Laugh\r\n\r\nBabies love to laugh, as it's a new sound for them to create. Playing games, singing songs, and tickling are good ways to make a baby laugh. These games will help a baby develop some early cognitive skills too. Making a baby laugh is easy through simple games and can be a welcome distraction for new parents dealing with a fussy child.\r\n\r\n50 Simple Ways to Make Your Baby Smarter\r\nInfant-development experts believe that the first years of a child's life are a prime time for learning, but sometimes it may be hard to think of new ways to stimulate your baby. Let these fun—and scientific—activities inspire you.\r\n\r\nWays to Boost Your Baby's Brain Power\r\nThese easy, everyday moves can help your baby — and later your toddler — further develop language, attention, and reasoning skills.\r\n\r\nAt birth, your baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons (as many as there are stars in the Milky Way!). During his first years, he will grow trillions of brain-cell connections, called neural synapses. Pretty impressive, right?\r\nBut here’s the thing: The rule for brain wiring is to use it or lose it. Synapses that are not \"wired together\" through stimulation are pruned and lost during a child's school years. Although an infant's brain does have some neurological hard-wiring, such as the ability to learn any language, it is more pliable and more vulnerable than a grown-up’s brain. And, amazingly, a toddler's brain has twice as many neural connections as an adult’s.\r\n\r\nWhen you provide loving, language-enriched experiences for your baby, you are giving his brain's neural connections and pathways more opportunities to become wired together. In turn, he will acquire rich language, reasoning, and planning skills. These easy tips, stimulating books and supervised, interactive activities will help make sure your young child’s brain is primed for years of learning ahead.\r\n\r\nChild development stages\r\n\r\nHow to Raise a Smart Baby\r\nConfused by the sheer number of smart baby toys, books, and videos? Relax. All your baby really needs to boost brainpower is you.\r\n\r\nYour baby’s brain: How parents can support healthy development\r\n\r\nYour baby’s brain is built over time: It starts during pregnancy, and continues through to early adulthood. And like a building, it needs a strong foundation.\r\n\r\nSo how does this development happen? That’s where parents come in. You can help your baby’s brain develop in healthy ways. It doesn’t take special toys or equipment, and it’s easier than you might think!\r\n\r\nBrain Development\r\nA child’s brain undergoes an amazing period of development from birth to three—producing more than a million neural connections each second.\r\n\r\nThe development of the brain is influenced by many factors, including a child’s relationships, experiences and environment. Learn more about the crucial role you play in building your baby’s brain, get your questions answered, and find some fun “brain-building” activities to share with your little one.\r\n\r\nI will be so gratefull if you download this app and give it 5 star in addition when you share it with your family and friends.\r\nvia rrnshams@gmail.com\r\nThank you.",

            "Truly an amazing app! It's mine and my husbands lifeline to always knowing what's going on with our son without having to play the guessing game! It's been especially helpful with us having to both work from home and not be able to afford a nanny or trust daycare (he's so young). We use the free version and are impressed I can only imagine what the paid version is like. If I have other kids, better believe this is my go to!! Lol",
            "Brilliant app, especially for first time parents like us. It helped us learn our daughter's patterns and daily routine and, as a result, spot when she wasn't feeding as usual and did in fact have an infection, which we were able to seek help and treat promptly as a result. Would recommend it to anyone!",
            "This app has been a Godsend!! The sweet spot is right on. I no longer have an overtired baby who won't go down for naps. Wish I knew about this sooner. I've been telling all new mom's to get this as well!",
            "LOVE this app! The sweet spot for wake windows for my baby are spot on, and I really like how I can record everything from how long he sleeps, to how long he eats, and even record his diaper output. It's so helpful to have all of his sleep recorded in the app because I would never be able to remember it accurately myself. The app is very easy to navigate and I also like the helpful tips for each new month. I recommend this app to every new mom I know!",
            "I love this tracking app! But as a mom to a newborn and busy 2 years old, I do find it time consuming to enter the app and switch to list view every time I want to check when the last feeding/pumping session/nap time etc, was. It would be nice to have a widget, or some type of \"at a glance\" option that could stay on my main screen that I could refer back to for when I forget what time I did something last. And being in that sleep deprived newborn stage, I forget a lot these days!"

            "Excellent, well thought out app. Got everything you will need to track things. Great that there are versions for other platforms too. My wife has an iPhone and I have android and this syncs perfectly between the two. Been a huge help for both of our children. My daughter had bowel surgery and we struggled with feeding, and this app meant we had all the data at our fingertips when we talked to doctors and dieticians about her progress. So thank you, whoever built this. I highly recommend it.",
            "Amazing for ADHD mom's!! Or busy ones!! Has a widget and you don't have to pay!!! Such a blessing!! Only 2 suggestions - 1. Fix the timers to where they will go off if the app is \"sleeping\" and 2. Have a running clock for nursing with a stop button on the lock screen! That would be amazing!! But absolutely love this app!",
            "So helpful for a new mom who would never carry around a paper chart nor remember last feeding start time or side. I love that the timer continues to run even when I leave the app since sometimes I use my phone for other things while feeding. Also adding a diaper change is only like 3 taps so super convenient which was especially nice in the first few days when we were counting each diaper!",
            "Very useful but sometimes doesn't save/sync entries. My husband and I both use it on our phones and sometimes it doesn't save entries from one phone to the other. Sometimes it doesn't save entries at all. This is a new issue, in the past 2 days so hopefully it can be fixed quickly.",
            "Love having the app to keep track of everything baby. I check it most often to see when was the last time I fed him when I'm too tired to remember which day is which. It also has been helpful during his check-ups when I have answers, dates and times for the pediatrician."

For example, if I use my double electric breast pump for 20 minutes to pump both breast, I have to increase the pumping time to 40 minutes which is not accurate. It is not programmed well in this area. The menu to see the history is not user friendly...it's harder to quickly navigate, especially when a current activity is happening. Sometimes, it finishes the activity.",

We recommend reading them aloud to your children before bed to help the lessons contained in them soak in better. Even though female and male versions of the fairy tales have the same plot, there are some differences between the texts. This has an educational goal in view making right accents in child-rearing depending on a child’s gender.\r\n\r\n☀️   Our great illustrated story books give a child an opportunity to become a hero who can solve various problems and make right deeds.

The reading books for children are quite short to make it easy for a child to listen till the end of the story, which is rather important. Our bedtime story books for kids are very interesting as they narrate about animals, insects, princes and princesses, etc. They teach love, respect, kindness, self-confidence. After having the book downloaded, you will need no online connection.\r\n\r\n💯   We spend hundreds of working hours on each story book, only because we love children. We dream of growing a healthy and genial generation of kids, therefore we do our best to make some of our bedtime reading books for kids available for free.

This fairytale tells us that puddles are friends of our children. All you need is to wear boots when you want to splash in them. The author of this adventure is well-known to you: Altai Zeinalov.<br><br>Illustrator ‒ Natalya Asanova. This is her second tale.<br>Composer ‒ Rotem Hecht. You are also well acquainted with his works.",

            "My toddler (2y 8m) really enjoys the stories. This is BY FAR the best app in this category that I've found for her age, because of the length of the stories and because each has lots of really cute illustrations. I bought the package to access all the stories and had some problems with download speeds at first, but the developers kept in touch with me and successfully took care of the issue. EDIT: any news of an update?",
            "No app is better than this in this field.I am a child from a middle class family and I can't afford to pay 350 to buy all the books.More people will purchase the stories if you reduce the price to Rs.25. I loved the graphics and live recording function and peaceful music playing in the background. All the best to the makers. Please reduce the price to 25 so that it could become user friendly.",
            "We love the books! However, my only negative response is I wish we could download it to our phones so that we could keep a recorded copy of both parents reading the same book. Especially because my babies like some books more than others. Also, if there was a feature to share it with family members so they could provide us with their voice recordings to be able to read to our little ones. Another bug is that sometimes it fast forwards and there is no way to stop it but exit the book and restart.",
            "Undoubtly this is best app in this category. I purcahsed full version expecting lot of new stories will get added every week. But sadly no new stories added in months! me and my child finished all the storeies in a week. Could you please add new stories and let us know how much time it would take. it would be great. thank you.",
            "Stories are ok, the voice recording function would be great if only it worked properly. The play back skips quickly and often doesn't finish a recorded sentence. Disappointing after having paid for all the stories."

            "Good app for kids but one thing when they cut. The patients everything we will feel unadorable so plz play this game very carefully ok if u want to then this is for ladies and girls only not for boys",

            "This app has been a great companion since the beginning of my pregnancy. Especially in times of Covid-19 where most of the antenatal classes and other birth preparation courses were cancelled this app has been an excellent and reassuring guide. It's amazing how much information (including videos about positive birth stories, yoga exercises etc) you get for free with this app. I can really recommend it!",
            "I've found it very useful, because you can register all your condition on it (such as pregnancy weight, newborn's condition and...) And then it gives you graphs. On the other hand, it gives you suggestions through checklists to be better prepared for delivery and after that. I've used it from the first month till know...",
            "Not only is this app amazing - the costumer service is beyond amazing. I couldn't download the app in my country so I decided to send them and email - after 4 hours they responded that they had made it available in all countries and that I should try again.... And it worked! 4hours after writing to them! I am super impressed. I am not sure if I can write your name - but MB, you know who you are - you are a rockstar!"

Fast forward 6 months and the app refuses to open as soon as i go to play a song the whole thing shuts down. I even factory reset her tablet and reinstalled the app just bc of this one issue and it still wont work. Plus ive forgotten her login info and can't get all the songs back she had. Whatever I would have bought a couple more for her but the stupid app still wont work.",

This has a better layout, and you can add things later if you forget. updates 1/19-syncing notification bar is now getting stuck. 1/20-Not fixed on version 2.7.4, worse. Now it won't sync at all 1/21-2.7.5 app is finally working on my phone, but my husband cannot sync and is seeing Google login failed. I am quickly losing interest in this app",
            "Update: how often does this app sync with drive, exactly? Because I've just rebooted my phone and a whole week of entries are gone. This is absolutely unacceptable for a paid app. (Well, actually it's unacceptable for ANY app, even the free ones). (old review :Purchased premium version, but I can't find how to use the new features. Maybe add a tutorial?)",
            "This app is amazing. It's my favorite app that I use. It keeps up with the baby's age, lets you add multiple children, tracks sleeping, feeding, stroller walks, milestones, dr visits, and much more. You can add notes and pictures, and there is even white noise options for sleeping. It's the best baby app I've used. The only thing I wish it did was keep track of the color and texture of bowel movements like other apps do. Other than that, this app is perfect.",
            "The app does what is says in the description, and my wife and I love it! what we don't love are the bugs... it's very common for the db to experience corruption, such as an odd combination of day and night mode, loss of baby name, age, and events, requiring us to restore from backup, and sometimes re typing entries from memory. also, the ads force scroll you to the top of the page when a new ad appears. my wife purchased the app and we share libraries, but i still get ads."

            "Ads for a childrens game? Whoever designed this game mustve been a special kind of moron. This game is designed for babies n children.. they dont need any ads.. remove the ad bar or i report",
            "Ads are terrible. As soon as my daughter touches it the browser automatically opens and closes the app. I'd happily pay a couple dollars for an ad free version. She has the phone in her hand for maybe a few seconds and boom. Touches an add then passes it to me and says fix it. Literally all I do is back out of the ad the whole time she has it. Neither one of us enjoy it. Fix it please",
            "The app is great and the music is nice, but my 10 month old can and will quickly press the \"disabled\" buttons until he gets into the rest of the phone. If there were an option like the one in the app settings to press the certain colored circle a certain number of times or require a passcode to exit the app, the app would be better.",
            "My baby sister loves playing with my phone and I didnt have any apps she could play on so I downloaded this, and so did the rest of my family. She really enjoys playing on it so thank you. I dont understand the people that keep complaining about adds. there hasn't been a single add since I got it!"

It's a fabulous new day for our beloved little princess!\r\nWe know that the family has just welcomed their new buddle of joy into the world. After all the excitement over the cute little girl, it's time to get down to the real business. They may be royals, but it’s still not easy for them to take care of a teeny-tiny baby. Now her royal highness needs you to lend a hand with the adorable baby Princess and give the little one your love. Caring for a little royal may be quite the same as caring for any baby. You still need to deal with things like feeding, dressing, bathing and entertaining the little one… and after a long day, nothing can be more comfortable than a warm bed. Put her in bed, and read her a bedtime story to send her off to dreamland. The sun says goodbye, and moon murmurs goodnight. Sweet dream, sweet night.\r\n\r\nHow to Play:\r\nOpen the game to enter the palace. Wow, the little beauty is up. Greet her with a big smile and do her morning routine: comb her hair, change the diaper, and feed her with some milk... Oh, look at her. The milk is dribbling right out of her mouth, let's gently wipe the milk away. The little rosy cheek wants to go out for a picnic, so she needs you to give her some advice on what to wear today. A cute pink dress, a tiny fancy tiara, and a cool sunglass will be amazing. Okay, put her into the stroller and…Oh wait, let's do a little something to make the stroller even cuter. You know she will be more than happy to see her stroller decked out. Phewww~ everything is settled. Let's go and enjoy the outdoor time! Don't forget to give her a regular check-up when she's back from the trip: measure the pressure, give her an injection…Aww, she's freaking out getting a shot. Don't worry, a cool toy room will definitely blow her mind and ease the pain. So why wait? Let's take the little darling to the toy room and have fun with her.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Learn life lessons while having fun\r\n- Cool toy room with endless surprises will definitely wow you\r\n- Lovely picture wall keeps fond memories\r\n- Fun health check-up is arranged \r\n- Enjoy interactive activities with a dose of fun\r\n\r\nAbout Libii Game:\r\nWith over 300 million downloads and growing, Libii is committed to creating innovative games for kids.

            "My wife and I have been loving the app for the past 3 months since our son was born. It's great for us both to be able to update the log from our own separate devices.",
            "Very useful to track my baby's record, and the diary feature is a great option. I can look back the entries made on the first toughest days and really feel the growth of the baby which can otherwise be easily forgotten. The app allows my partner to partake in raising our baby first hand, share memories and understand emotional ups and downs.",
            "Easy to use, love the breastfeeding timer so much! The growth chart is helpful and the little diary with photo option is such a nice feature. This app especially helped me during the newborn phase, but then was also great for tracking introducing solid foods etc.",
            "Great app for parents! One of the most comprehensive baby tracking apps. Also super easy to use!",
            "Great app with lots of capabilities and love the sync with partner option. Makes keeping a daily record of my newborn for his doctor. I just wish I could pick a custom alarm sound. The alarm sound is too loud and startles my baby."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "I love this app! It is user-friendly, intuitive, and beautifully designed. It has all of the features I want (tracking feeding and diapers, and the ability to share the profile so two people can enter and view activities) plus features I didn't know I wanted until I started using them (chronological \"journal\" of activities, as well as a 24-hour \"glance\" summary and bar graphs under \"stats\"). The creators responded quickly when I needed help learning how to share the profile. Overall excellent!",
            "Having a preemie baby it was incredibly important that my husband and I keep very accurate and specific track of our daughter's habits. This app was perfect and had everything we needed in one place. It is also helpful that we both can have access to it to add things and make changes. We have been able to provide all the information doctors need to ensure correct development of our little. We are incredibly happy with it.",
            "Amazing app! I have twins and this app makes it insanely easy to juggle back and forth and track EVERYTHING even when i pump i track that and can keep track of what i set back to freeze. You can even personalize this app too which helps switching back and forth that i don't accidentally log something under the wrong baby. You can personalize reminders, and i really can't say enough good things about this app, THANK YOU 💕",
            "The perfect app for parents. I love that if my daughters doctor asks for certain stats I can immediately pull it up with this app. It is user-friendly and easy to use the Simplicity makes it so nice that even when you're exhausted after a long night of feeding you still can click and store all the information you need and one quick second",
            "Great way to track my infants daily activities and be able to easily share it with my partner. The ease of use even when we are both tired from a midnight feeding makes the tracking much easier. The history function helps use build daily routines and shows us about what time we can expect the next feeding to be able to run errands in between."

            "Exactly what I need! A lightweight, simple app with a variety of sleep and soothing sounds. We use it all night and every nap time for my son. We co-sleep part the night so I put it on in both our rooms, and I'm sleeping much better myself now that I'm not being woken up as much by random noises. I think I'll sleep with white noise on for myself indefinitely! It's great.",
            "No good with ads. Often the noise stops by itself or starts pausing. Currently the brown noise goes on for 2 minutes then goes off. Trying to re-install to see if that helps matters. Used to be brilliant but now pop up ads come up which startle baby or stop sounds. Quite annoying as app itself is good",
            "The ads are too loud in the free version! The reason we use this app is to calm down the baby. But suddenly ads pop up and wake up the baby completely. We understand it is a free version and ads are necessary but they could be at least without sound.",
            "Adds pop up when you need to turn on/off the music. The baby loves sleeping with this music but after he falls asleep adds with sound wakes him up. You have to wait a lot of seconds before using the app. You can\"t switch it off by closing all apps because it runs in the background. The price is very high for switching off the apps. Too bad. It was my favorite before this. Now I have to uninstall it and find another one.",
            "I've used this app with both my kids and its been great. But the recent introduction of ads with sound is completely ridiculous! I'm trying to get my baby to sleep and change the white noise type and get a ridiculous loud ad that wakes her up! It completely defeats the object of an app to help with sleep. I'm uninstalling and will use another."

Also, i dont like having to go back and delete the extra letters it creates when i try to type. Example: typing the word has turns out like hhahas. Lastly, i wish you had an option for the first day the baby is born as i had gotten this before i was due. When my son came, it was hard to use it the way its intended.",
            "Not customizable enough. Also not inclusive! Only allows options for \"mom and dad\", no options for lgbtq or single parents... I also wasn't a fan of the fact that you have to imput time along with an entry, for example, cutting baby's nails: why must I put exactly long it took? Its not necessary at all and only complicates things. I understand for pumping, but for baby care? Its just something that bugs me slightly considering its a paid app. Overall, just wish for more customization...",
            "It's really helpful, now I can keep tracking my baby activities, check stats weekly, monthly. Just wonder if this app has a feature like back up the data to cloud such as gg drive, one drive, so I can recover my data if something accidentally happen to my phone.",
            "Decent app - still early days using it but i like the wide range of things u can track. One error I feel- in the quick insights bit, there is no report for \"Total daily sum of the feed\", so i can see how much the baby has had so far today. Also, the holy grail would be to have an app where both mum and dad can update and sync from different phones."

            "cant have a toddler play because it has an ad bar so they will always hit it interrupting any fun they would've had. in response to the reply, you can have adverts between swapping of games or to unlock features for a small time period. but when my 10 month is trying to press something on the screen to see something happen he swipes large portions because there hand eye coordination is lacking. so ad bars are a terrible thing to have.",
            "I'd give this a 5 star rating if it would actually let me buy the full version. But the link is broken in the game and so until it's fixed all I can give it is 2 stars because the trial is so limited and the ads are annoying. I just want to give you my money!",
            "This game encourages your children to click on the ads. I was watching my son play this game and of course like any free app an ad pops up every minute, but unlike most apps this one says \"pleeeeaaasssee\" trying to actually lure your children to click on ads. I wouldnt be suprised if it tried to trick them into giving it your credit card info too! 0 out of 10 will be uninstalling immediately.",

The exercises are instructed by professionals, so they can easily be performed at your home or wherever you need to play and do some exercise. \r\n\r\nThe app also contains training exercises aimed at the child’s parents. In particular, it focuses on exercise for dad. Many of the exercises can also be performed by mom. The child takes part in the exercises for the parents. \r\nSupport your child while it gradually gains control of its body. For example, your baby needs to learn to hold its wobbly head, creep and crawl, coordinate eyes and hands and turning. When your baby is a bit older, good motor skills improve independence and self-confidence.  \r\n\r\nWhen your child has had an adequate amount of sensory impression, your child will become aware of his/her body. Body awareness is a prerequisite for good motor skills, which demand physical activity, where social competencies are developed among other things. Motor skills and learning are generally related.

            "Pretty good but room for improvement For parts of the app it's strange the way it's written for the checklists ie, \"you suck your thumb more, you cry more\", I'm not doing this, my child is! And other times it refers to the child by its name (kinda random) . Subscription service is pretty strange too, just look at it!! It cracks me up. Great app over all though! Worth about 4 bucks in my opinion. I'd get it as it's full of fantastic recourses.",
            "This book/ app is so helpful with keeping your head on straight during the leaps. I found it very helpful to know why my daughter was all of a sudden less smiley and sleeping worse. It was equally helpful to know when it would end. As a first time parent, I use the leap-appropriate games and activities suggestions often- helps to appreciate the wonder of her learning curve. Love this and can't suggest it more highly.",
            "Very confusing to navigate, non Intuitive, and has grammar issues. Text heavy. not worth $5. Seems like every time your kid is fussy the answer is mental leap. Might as well Google growth spurts and child development and get simpler and quicker explanations of what's happening.",
            "Terrible layout, confusing information. The app says in one spot we're in the middle of a developmental leap, and another spot says it won't be starting for two more weeks. It's hard to navigate to find the information you're looking for. I don't recommend.",
            "Very disappointed that I paid for this. Its so confusing and I'm not getting anything from it at all. My baby doesn't follow any of the \"leaps\" and the signs make me anxious that I should expect things that never happen. I'll be deleting and just going with the flow."

I'm a little bleh about paying a whole year upfront. I'd be more inclined to stay if it were monthly charges instead. We'll see after the trial is over.",

            "Pretty decent app especially compared to similar ones out there. Expected delivery to take forever but was impressed it only took roughly a week (at least in the UK). Every single item is packed neatly and individually, quality so far was amazing, clothing so soft and the size right on point! Love all the discounts! There is room for improvement, such as the filters which don't always work (when choosing to see only a certain size, age etc), but overall I'm impressed and will keep on buying!",
            "The filters don't always work well which can be frustrating. The sizing of the clothes are not consistent. You also don't always get what is pictured. For e.g. I thought I was getting a set but it was only a top. I bought several items and satisfied with about half of what I received. Still on the fence about ordering again even with a voucher they sent me.",
            "I love shopping with PatPat! I'm Australian, so I was surprised how quick shipping is. The quality of clothing is great and the range of bright coloured clothing for boys is brilliant! It's so great to see an affordable clothing company doing bright clothing for boys rather than the boring blues, greys and browns you usually have to choose from at most shops. They have awesome sales too. I've been receiving lots of comments from strangers about my son's cool clothing.",
            "I like the clothes but the quality of some dresses is good and some not that good. And patpat made some levels if you reach that level you will receive some gift voucher every month but unfortunately they are not doing it, they have provided 1 month after that we need to chase them for the rewards. Instead of understanding customer querry they just want to debate with customers, I feel it's unprofessional and they need to improve customer service."

Labeling the WHO 50th percentile value as \"ideal\" is both medically inaccurate and unnecessarily concerning to parents. At best, you could label a range as \"typical\" (e.g. 5th to 95th percentile). The app also flags any measurements outside of 15/85% as abnormal, which isn't right by itself and isn't even consistent with the WHO recommended cutoffs (2/98%). Also some weird English translations (perimeter vs. circumference) and it's awkward to use with inches/pounds (when you go to edit a measurement the value is in kg/cm even if you entered it in lbs/in).",

This is always my 1st choice when buying baby stuff and essentials because of the great deals, fast delivery and easy returns. Before I buy from other baby apps, I will always check if its available at FirstCry first. What's more, there is no minimum order required! ❤❤❤ When I choose to return an item, it was collected the next day. Thank you Firstcry for your great customer service!",
            "Very bad! It's so difficult to add your address in this application. I'm using e-commerce apps for last 15 years now but have never experienced an app which I have to uninstall only because I fail to put my address into that app repeatedly for receiving the items I intend to order. I have already uninstalled it 4-5 times after I'm not able to configure my address. For God's sake, what's \"Makani\" number? I'm subscribed to so many e-commerce apps and no-one asks for a \"Makani\".1😒",
            "Brilliant app for kids clothing, no question asked on return and refund policy and cash on delivery makes it the most preferred choice of shopping. I have been using it for the last 3yrs and I'm very very happy with them. They come up with Good collection and Offers every month.",
            "Excellent shopping destination. 1 star for the bug which does not allow to open the cart. Just stays loading forever. Tried reinstalling the app and it solves the issue. But starts again after a while.",
            "Best app for the new parents, featuring parenting option in there app helps alot, second shopping experience is great with them the prices are very cheap according to markets rates. Another best feature is next day free delivery and very satisfied with delivery guy (Abdul Rauf) very professional."

Please fix this its been like this for over a month. Edited......still cant add codes. The app still closes when trying to....... Edit....PLEASE FIX APP this is craxy i have a ton of codes to add and cant do anything with them because your app still is not working. Its been months now. And it still DOESNT WORK",
            "I love the app and the benefits that come with it, but my phone number has changed from my first child to my 3rd, and you can only enter diaper rewards after you get a code that was texted to you when you started using the app. It asks to resend the code and is this still your number, but there is no place to enter or say yes or no to the number confirmation.I have removed and installed this app at least 6 times to no avail!",
            "App worked great on my phone up until recently. Now when I press the scan button the app crashes. I guess they no longer support android 6. I have reinstalled the app following your instructions, but the scan function still crashes the app. App and phone software are up to date. My phone has Marshmallow (6.0.1) and API 23.",
            "The app is great and it works great! However, my issue is there is a daily, weekly, and monthly scan limit which is very aggravating. The monthly limit is only 17. I save all the packages until a time I have to enter them and this limit just doesn't work ☹ take the limits back off.",
            "Overall love it! Has a few hiccups with the receipt scanning feature, have not been able to get my digital Sam's Club receipts uploaded, which stinks because I buy the big $41 boxes in bulk there. Aside from that though the scanning and cash back bonuses are really nice! Spending a fortune on diapers, its nice to get a little something back here and there!!"

Entertain him with a lovely game and score as many goals as you can. Help him play music and have a good time. Once he's done with singing you can also pick his outfit of the day. Choose cool accessories and pretty clothing items to match your chic style. After all these activities our baby boy is starving and demands food.

            "Outstandingly clean and reliable app for clinicians who just need a point assessment of a patient's growth. As other reviews have stated though, probably not the best for anyone wanting to track their child's growth over time and see trends.",
            "Reliable but with some problems. The app is very reliable and easy to use but it has a lot of shortcomings. Basically the fact that it does not show the measurements on a chart and that it does not allow you to store multiple measurements of multiple patients. It also seems like the development has stopped since it was last updated in 2017.",
            "This app has a lot of negative reviews as it doesn't store data or create a growth chart. These negative reviews are unfair as the description clearly states \"Calculate one-off growth centiles for children using UK-WHO data from the RCPCH.\" As a health visitor I use this app to calculate ONE OFF growth centiles before plotting it in the \"red book\" or documenting it in the patient record. It's especially good if there are any concerns about infant growth as it gives the centiles range and the exact centile, so small changes can be seen. It also gives the age in days and gestational age. It could be improved by the addition of the age in weeks too.",

Also, she keeps accidently clicking on the purchase button too as the adverts keep popping up. It can easily run up your card!",

Each one needs a separate feed like one wants cereal and the other one needs some fruits. Make them happy by giving them their favourite food and get lots of love as a best babysitter.\r\n\r\nTime to give them a bath but triplet baby care is not easy because they don’t like it. Carefully shower them with shampoo and use various toys to avoid them for weeping.\r\n\r\n After this change the dress of the triplet baby. This newborn care nursery game has lots of fun while choosing a pretty dress up from different options. Being a daycare babysitter you also have the tough job to wear them diapers.\r\n\r\nGet them to the bed for some nap. Give them a feeder so that they can sleep well. You can get toys for the triplet baby care by using coins which you will earn through different activities in this exciting newborn nursery daycare game. \r\n\r\nAnd lastly, is the sleeping time. Set the triplet in their bed, give them their pacifier, cover them in a blanket and turn the lights off. That concludes your babysitter tasks for the day.

            "This was one of my sons favorite apps. The most recent update seems to have ruined it. Several characters have disappeared from the video chat part and the 3 videos are completely gone. Update (3/2019): Company responded quickly. After some time they did bring back the 3 videos. However, not all the characters returned to the video chat and they did not add any new characters.",
            "I Downloaded this game for my 10m daughter, there's a lot of buffering going on and it makes me sad for her because she gets super excited. Then the call ends or just repeats itself over and over. The camera doesn't work, it's all black and won't take her picture. Just a little disappointed knowing this is the newest app compared to the original.",
            "A recently added pop-up asking if more of a particular character is wanted has made the app clumsy and unusable. When the app didn't have that feature the call would simply end and my son could pick a new character to call or get more Color Crew without an app crashing prompt. I have to close and reopen the app every other call.",
            "Right now, the app has an ad that appears everytime a video call with a character ends and I have to reset the whole app everytime. This happens after 2 'video calls' and I hope this gets fixed. Otherwise my daughter loves the app! Please fix this bug!",
            "2yr old loves it, but camera doesn't work only shows a black screen. So we haven't been able to personalize it with her picture. The whole reason I got the app was so she'd have a play camera instead of getting into mine all the time. Other than that I like the app."

The ability to change between male and female voices and to choose between pictures or drawings means that this could keep most kids occupied and happy - and UK, not American English is always good!",
            "My 3 year old son has been playing this over the last 2 months and he loves it! He's learnt practically all of the words and tells me each word as he plays it. It's a relief to find an app that doesn't use US English for the pronunciation or the words. The text is very clear and choosing the pictures and voices is great. Autoplay is very handy too! Thank you very much!",

        "description": "ParentPal™ is an all-in-one personal parenting coach from Teaching Strategies® in partnership with the creators of Baby Einstein. The app provides tools and a daily roadmap to take the guesswork out of parenting. It assists you in providing the right daily experiences to help your children from birth to age 5 reach their key developmental milestones and thrive.  \r\n\r\nParenting is hard enough without feeling like you need to become a child development expert—or an organizational wizard mastering various methods to track feeding, growth, health, and first-did-it moments. \r\n\r\nAs the leaders in early childhood and pre-school curriculum for childcare centers, pre-K programs, and school districts across the country, we’ve done that work for you. We collaborated with the creators of the award-winning Baby Einstein, consulted with pediatricians, and analyzed the guidelines of more than 20 national organizations. The result is a super-engaging and easy-to-use parenting coach and family engagement resource. \r\n\r\nParents are born the day their babies are. But unlike other worthy challenges you might have tried before—like training for a race, losing weight, or cooking chef-inspired meals—it’s a scary time to learn on the job. That’s because 80% of the human brain is formed by age 3, and it’s largely dependent on the quality of stimuli and experiences provided by parents and caregivers. \r\n\r\nEach day, ParentPal replaces the frantic Internet searches and worry about what’s “normal” and what to do next with confident engagement and research-based guidance…plus tracking tools, memory books, personal trends, and easy, one-handed usability. \r\n \r\nFEATURES:\r\n•\tDaily Plan recommends activities and routines appropriate for your child’s age \r\n•\tDiary shows all your reported events each day for easy recall\r\n•\tMilestones tracking identifies and guides the key developmental milestones each month\r\n•\tSleep Tracking measures sleep and plays music that restarts automatically if your child awakens and cries\r\n•\tHealth and Growth tracking record height, weight, health symptoms, vaccines, and doctors visits \r\n•\tA library of 3200+ research-based activities and media\r\n•\tThe ability to connect your entire caregiving team: the daily plan and data capture remain the same across handoffs from Mom to Dad, grandma, aunt, teacher, or nanny during the day. \r\n•\tWeeSchool™, an optional curricular program for parents and professional childcare providers looking for a more comprehensive, turnkey schooling program\r\n•\tMemory books to capture, preserve, and share photos and videos \r\n•\tSupport for multiple children\r\n•\tAward-winning music designed to expose even infants to key elements of music, syntax, tempo, and rhythm, with classical favorites by Mozart and Beethoven as well as popular children’s songs\r\n•\tSmart Shopping recommendations to save time and money by prioritizing just those toys and books your child really needs for healthy development and preschool readiness, with links to Amazon\r\n•\tBuy one, give one—for every paid annual subscription, we will donate a free subscription to a family in need\r\n•\tNo in-app ads\r\n•\tTrends and insight charts to track progress\r\n\r\nUNMATCHED CHILD DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE:\r\n•\tTeaching Strategies is the #1 provider of early childhood curriculum and developmental assessment in the country across private, public, and Head Start Programs. \r\n•\tBaby Einstein was the leading baby media program in the country\r\n•\tParentPal incorporates the Ireton Child Development Review (CDR), research-based milestones—the same milestones pediatricians use. \r\n\r\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS:\r\nParentPal offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\r\n$12.99/month \r\n$119/year (that’s equivalent to $9.99 monthly)\r\nThe first two weeks are free and you can cancel within that time without a charge. \r\n\r\nThe subscription will auto-renew unless turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the current period ends.",

            "I think it does need a undo button because if I have made a mistake on the drawing then I press the bin button and it is gone. So it needs one so I do not have to keep useing the rubber button. I gave it 2 stars because you do not need to be told 2 times for the same thing do you? The answer should be no if not please let me know what you think about it!🚫🚫 This is not acceptable for your game I have to agree with the offer prison I might even bin the game if you do not put in a undo button!",

I have real heartbeat doppler and when I use it, my baby wil kick it, but she won't kick like mad like she just did with this app.",
            "Its good you can measure your own heartbeat and hear baby's heartbeat but as for ads they are so annoyingly interfering at first i thought it wasnt working becoz the ad didn't allow me to close it and i had to exit and come again to find the same ad you close it comes another ad ypu have to pass maybe 4 or 5 ads before you get to where want so I hate that and so m gonna look for another better app m deleting this one",
            "Fake measuring of the heart beat of the baby ..i tested it first i thought good i am listening the baby's heart beat but the very next moment i thought to re-check so i keep the scanner away from my tummy and placed it on one of the near by object it then also started recording heart beat...Fake...Fake...Fake....stop fooling please you all are playing with the sentiments of the expected mother..Shameful act.",

One minute they're enjoying the app and then the next POOF the game is gone. They don't understand the concept of ads and being patient. But I guess that's one way to get the parents to pay for your app right?",

            "My wife and I are extremely impressed with the quality and functionality of both this app and the related baby scale. It's so intuitive, clean, and easy to use. I especially love that the app automatically imports the measurements from the scale in real time as we weigh our son. We also manually add his measurements each time he has a checkup. I love being able to see his height and weight tracked against the averages and see where he lies with percentiles. Truly blown away, 10/10!!",
            "Scale works but the app doesn't always record weight. Doesn't matter how many times you click save, it works when it feels like working.",
            "The scale seems nice but the app rarely records measurements. I get the pop-up with the weight, I click save, and the data doesn't appear, even after restarting the app and trying multiple times. Sometimes it doesn't save even when I make a manual weight recording. We've already lost some data to this issue which is extremely frustrating and defeats the purpose of buying a smart scale.",
            "Beautiful interface, easy to use. I only wish it has fields to track length and head measurements and computes BMI based on those measurements. But overall, clean UI and syncs easily with the scale.",
            "This app is so smooth and works great with the scale. One of my favorite amazon purchases."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Don't bother. Worked for about 3/4 days then stopped. Believe the reviews when they say it is unreliable and doesn't update properly. I have messaged the 'support' team several times and each time they ask me to send screenshots and check the settings. Even after all that it still doesn't work. SO glad I didn't subscribe and pay any money for this. This could be why it works so well in the beginning and then stops - maybe this is an attempt to make you subscribe??",
            "The last week this app has not been working well. Location is not accurate. When my son gets home the app location says that my son is still at school. My son has always his location on...There is a malfunction every day with the app... Update 20/10/2020: Still doesnt work properly! It randomly works. Some days it works pefectly and other days it wont. Very frustrating!!!!!!!!! I have had many chats with support but they still couldnt help me. Beginning to regret that I bought this app.",
            "Loved the app when I first downloaded it bit recently it has been rubbish the recordings don't work it doesn't connect to my childs phone it doesnt show the location and does random things even when the phone is locked and child can't access, i have contacted support but they keep saying the same thing and it doesn't work. Really frustrating 😕.",
            "£26 to use the app for only three family members is taking the p!££. AND it doesn't even include everything... they sell minutes packages separately! Just unreasonably expensive, also considering the risk of it not working properly, as highlighted by some reviews. I can't understand... these sort of apps have a great potential, but they're all taking the p!££. Just charge reasonably and you'll have millions of users... it's not rocket science! People don't like to be ripped off, you know?",
            "It will help a lot if we can send a pin location from the chat with parents app when you press the Sos button and als please give us the option to login with the user ID so the ability to login on any phone so much easier to be able to find the kid in need in emergency wen you can't be there in time to help the team looking for the child so the ability to let a team member login to the app for emergency."

        "description": "As a parent raising a child, I made an application called ‘Don't cry my baby’, to help other parents. \r\n\r\n- It has mainly five (5) features. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is white-noise. For those babies under 3 months old, they easily fall asleep while listening to mother’s heartbeat, water drops, cloth brushing sound, etc. \r\nSo, it is equipped with a function to play up to maximum three (3) sounds (you can select from twelve (12) sounds of white-noise, that are similar to the environment inside mother, such as TV noise, cleaner sound, heart-beat, vinyl bag, etc.) at the same time. (For your information, turning on music mixed with TV sound, water droplet, and heart-beat worked great on my baby) \r\n\r\nSecondly, it is lullaby. This app is equipped with most well-known twelve (12) lullabies (English songs, classic, Music Box, etc.). It also has a function to record lullaby in mother/father’s voice and to play it repeatedly.\r\nLow-toned father’s voice is better transmitted to fetus, such that it reacts far better than mother’s voice. It is known that it also helps baby’s brain development. (For your information, I recorded five (5) children’s songs and my wife turned them on while I was at work. Later she told me that it reacted quite well to my voice.)\r\n\r\nThirdly, it is a baby toy. Babies tend to cry and bellow until 100 days. Parents try almost any possible way to soothe baby. Usually, playing with a rattling or whistling toy may stop baby’s crying.\r\nSo I inserted a function of four baby toys (rattle, duck toy, whistle). (for your information, it worked great with this toy function whenever we are moving in a car, or when a baby starts to cry)\r\n\r\nFourth option is the sound of animal / vehicle/ musical instrument. Kids learn to love animal sound after 6 months old.\r\nSo, I bought a sound book for my baby, but it was too heavy and too large. So, I created an app and put the file in it.\r\nTurn on the sound of animal/ vehicle/ musical instrument using your smart phone. ^^ (my son can easily focus on music whenever I turn on animal sound while we are driving)\r\n\r\nFifth option is watching kid’s video. This function enables us to connect to video from YouTube and NAVER Kids sites, which our kids like. \r\nWe tried to build with some popular sounds, to avoid search and listen every time we want to get access to certain music on cellular phone.\r\n\r\n1. Possible to turn on music up to a total of three (3) different sounds at the same time, choosing from twelve (12) soothing sounds\r\n2. Built with twelve (12) music including English lullaby, classic lullaby, organ (music box)\r\n3. Possible to record mother’s or father’s lullaby\r\n4. Possible to send a recorded file and to share it with your family\r\n5. Possible to add a music file that your child likes to a lullaby list\r\n6. Possible to listen to a selected lullaby or a mother’s/father’s lullaby continuously\r\n7. Possible to listen to more than one sound (for instance, lullaby and white noise at the same time), or also possible to choose play time at your choice.\r\n8. Has 4 different rattle options. (it rattles for about 3~5 seconds, if shaken left and right)\r\n9. Possible to watch kids’ video through YouTube or \"NAVER Kids\" sites.\r\n\r\nIt will help improve our application. Please leave your comments after using our app, or ask if there is any specific function you would like to see.",

            "love the lady's voice on the songs. I also love the songs, the fact that you can upload your own pics to play during the song, they have the lyrics in another tab and the are other tabs with animals and their sound and a few other things. The play cycle is continues and you can check which songs you want on the play list and which ones you don't, that way I only have my favorites.",
            "In my opinion this is the best lullaby app around. I like the fact that lyrics are included if you want so sing along. You can change the background and insert your pictures of choice ❤️ All the white noise is there and it mimics the real thing. It's got animal sounds, rattle, birthday cake, and more. I just love it. I downloaded it 3years ago for my first baby. I came back for it for my second baby. Brings back memories 💕",
            "I don't usually give ratings but this app deserve this lil effort from me. It definitely deserve a 5 stars rating. It helps me calm my fussy son, like I already felt helpless and panicking, but when I played the first song he calmed down. like in seconds! lol I also enjoy the option that you can add pictures to make it more personal! there are also other options like toys and other sounds like vacuum etc. Definitely worth downloading. 👌👏",
            "Excellent. Baby falls asleep fast. It contains multiple options including sounds of home appliances and white noise so that your baby would go to sleep easily. It also provides animals' and toys' sounds. I am more than satisfied, thanks to creators of this app. A must-have for young parents"

If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "This game is ok I would never play this in my freetime, and I don't like the animaton. It's terrible and the animation sucks! It looks like the creator just rushed it when it could have been a good game but you rushed it. If your pregnant and you want to learn about being pregnant I do recommend, but for all of you that are not, look at something else!!!",
            "The is perfect for pregnant women. It teaches you everything i am very proud of the creators. But the reason i reduced a star because you cannot operate the woman that's a little disappointing. Creators if you are reading this its a humble request to add this feature please please. I love this game and i dont want to uninstall it.",
            "Very good game...portrays a pregnant mother's life accurately. Excellent! The only thing is that I felt the 'Baby Care' level a bit boring. The rest was all excellent! Going to hospital, ordering items from iPhone....very good. Just improve 'Baby Care' level and then include more and more of levels...overall, nice game!👍👍 sufficient to get 4 stars!!",
            "FINALLY A GAME WITH EASY CONTROLS !!!!!! I love this game I just wish it had more levels and more to do so far everything is so accurate! Maybe giving baby a bath more levels of baby getting older feeding him in a high chair changing clothes etc mom cooking going to the store taking baby for a walk in stroller or if baby grows and walks as a toddler take him to play ! I'm just glad theres no timer either ! I totally love this game so I'll keep it downloaded and wait for more levels ! Great game!",
            "This app is amazing the little details are so incredible! It feels so realistic however there are some small issues in my opinion I don't understand why when you buy clothes on the pregnancy app it shows dresses and a t-shirt, if she can only wear the track suits why not just have her buy the track suits instead of the dresses? Also it's a little annoying that when you have a baby boy he's in a super girly nursery I think all the baby stuff should had been made gender neutral. Great game tho!"
