            "I used this app years ago and quit for 3 months before i stopped using it and fell off. It was my first try. Im using it again now and it is a great way to stay on track. The premium version is also inexpensive and i love how i can pay weekly for the added features. If you are serious about quitting, I highly recommend this app. It is the lifeline that made me quit the first time and im so excited to say that I am a nonsmoker now!",
            "This app's easy to use interface and prompts keep one motivated in quitting. I have been off cigarettes for a week now. The diary writing, quit coach, save money options are something that give one an added incentive. The graphical representation of progress in terms of effect on body has also given me greater awareness of how I have been hurting myself with this death stick.",
            "I really liked it at the start, free trial was great, reminders, chats with the robot. I went into the app today to see how much money I've saved. I've been kicked out, all my stats are gone. There's no where to sign in! This is a major flaw. I'm so disappointed.",
            "Great stuff. At such a vulnerable time, I find it helpful to be distracted by \"the good news\" & outcomes from my healthier choices. And as we all know, stopping is super easy compared to \"staying stopped'. \"Not another puff no matter what\" says it all.",
            "Very Helpful!!! Free, informative and bolstering. Helped get me on track, counting days for me so I didnt focus on it. Telling me useful information that strengthened my resolve. All for the price of free fiddy. Take the leap, you will feel so much better in many ways."

It shows how much you saved and it tells you how many cigarettes you could of smoked but didn't. It's really helping me quit. Only the 2nd day but it's going good.",
            "I really like the app for what it is. Although, I wish I could pause it? Most of us will try and retry a couple times, and the app seems to not account for even one cigarette. If I slip up, you gotta give me five minutes (at least) to light one up before the timer restarts. I'm just asking for two separate buttons - a \"stop timer\" and a \"restart timer\".",
            "Ads aren't annoying, the interface is very straightforward, and its already helping me cut back. 4 stars because i wish there was a way to track ongoing progress instead of just how long you've been cold turkey. Like, a log of the last 10 resets on the timer would be awesome.",
            "User friendly. The important statistics are there. However i would suggest to enter an average price for the cigarettes. As a smoker for 15 years, I didn't bought the pack at the same price. For now i pay 5 euros but when i started it was around 2 so the total amount is definitely lower. Great app!!",
            "Terrific App..has helped significantly.However, would be so much better if there was a section included for Nicotine Replacement Therapy as this is what I'm using at present to quit... The timing can't be changed eg.. It was approximately 5pm when I downloaded this app.. I actually had last cigarette at 2pm..but it counted from the time of download...can't go back to change the time.wont allow.. Also when price change of smokes rise, the app won't acknowledge it...hmmm.."

If it weren't for this app I'd be $650 out of pocket and still be a smoker. Thanks to the Dev team and people behind the idea of this app and the creation. I reccomend anyone who wants to quit download this app because it holds you accountable and shows you the benefits of your quitting journey as you go!! Thanks again, cheers.",
            "My smoking habit was not very bad but I could see it was getting out of hand. I had started to smoke about 7-8 a day. This app was core to me being able to quit. I had some false starts and fast led a few times. But the fact that the app makes you reset and restart creates a very real feeling of failure that makes it easier for you to stay on track. Loved the rewards being unlocked and the stats on the app. It really keeps you accountable to yourself. I love it!",
            "Good for basic health achievements. Just paid in full after the free trial. What a waste of money. Only 2 games on there and neither of them really keep me occupied, both are really boring! Achievements which encourage you to gamble by making bets with friends! Junk. Great basics but don't bother paying!!",
            "It is a really helpful support for quitting tobacco. Already 6 months, and I still come back to the app to check how many money I have saved, and how my body is improving for quitting smoking. Really helpful!!",
            "Subtle things like the notification bar at the top of my screen blinking with a small flame, lets me know that I'm doing something. That I have a goal to accomplish, and documenting my cravings helps me put into perspective the amount of will power needed to truly quit. Satisfied with the purchase of the app & Pro Version.

The only things that I think would make it better is the ability to share the progress chart and maybe the choice of a widgit or notification option to alert you when you can have your next cig according to the programme. I have noticed a few times that I look and see I have another 20 minutes to go but then I'm trying not to clock watch as I get stressed out that way. Thank you!!",
            "Very useful. Helps to control how many cigaretes you smoke at the start. I hope it will help me to quit as well. Notifications works fine for me .You just have to go to settings and change the sound from silence to any sound you want. 5 star because is simple and easy",
            "it's the best anti smoking app i've seen, i downloaded a bunch of others but they all work the same way, by cutting out smoking completely and giving you achievements and stats on how well youre doing, anyone who has tried to quit can tell you this doesnt work. this app reduces the times you smoke gradually making it so much more easy",
            "It is an amazing application that is making me reduce smoking but there is one issue i cannot change the notification tone, i am changing the tone but it still uses the default tone i don't know what to do.",
            "The app itself is helpful. Not pushy or accidentally judgemental like the other quit smoking apps. But the biggest problems are 1) notifications don't seem to work and 2) The super awesome widget (my fav feature) is useless because it doesn't update unless you go into the app, and sometimes not even then. Which kind of makes the widget useless."

            "Only on day one but this app is very well tought out and I made payment after just an hour or so because the developer deserves it. I have high hopes for this and have started vaping at the same time as installing the app. Edit... What might be cool is if you could add something to keep track of spending on nicotine replacement and vape. Just to keep the saving numbers straight Also. I cannot see any way to admit to a slip up. I dont intend to slip but don't want to have a total reset if I did",
            "This is a fantastic app. Only thing I see i would change is I wanted to set the quit time for midnight tonight when I would have my last smoke but it said I can't set the quit time for the future. Doesn't make much sense. So when I do quit I have to start the app all over. Otherwise great app.",
            "Love the information in the health risk section about all the nasties in cigarettes, how they affect your body, and your brain while smoking and throughout the process of quit!! Both my husband and myself use this for motivation. 4 days in and we feel great!",
            "Good app in theory and the financial tracking is really helping me. However, my amount saved and cigs not smoked keeps going backwards...I'm not sure why!",
            "This is a no nonsense app. You get more info than any other app out there without having to pay to get the extras. I love the fact that it isn't an antivape app like all the others. I selected vape for my booster and it shows up on the dashboard. Thank you for making an app that actually works and allows the user to quit cigarettes the they want or need to."

The only thing I would suggest is to have the option to select that you are using nicotine replacement therapy like nicoderm. One of the first badges I earned is something to do with the amount of nicotine in your bloodstream reducing to half but I am not convinced that it is accurate mainly because I am using the patch to help me get through this.",
            "I really loved this app, despite the sometimes dubious chats that occurred! However, my phone crashed, I lost everything, and when I reinstalled it, it had my quit date and other data, but no record of my having paid the £3.95 to upgrade to PRO!. I have contacted QuitNow, but have had no response.. hence the 4 stars."

I've known people who will light one and just sit there holding it. it's ridiculous because they buy cigarettes just to let them burn in their hand. but other than that it's a great way to track how long you can go.",

I also really like the interface and how intuitive the app is. I'm on day 16 and it feels really good. I appreciate this app and the developer to keep me motivated.",
            "Only thing that annoys me is that I installed the app a day and 3 hours after I actually stopped but the app doesn't allow you to put the time/ date in. It starts when you first set it up with no option of changing it. Also the money wasted I ignore seeing as a pk of cigarettes back when I started cost 99p and you can't even buy 10 anymore, the calculation of money wasted is based on today's price and doesn't consider inflation or taxes.",
            "It is a very helpful tool to stop smoking. It keeps track of the amount of time not having a smoke to the second. Also a big eye opener for me was when it showed how much money I wasted on cigarettes. Having all that information layed out infront of me, helps a lot with the cravings."

            "Great app to track your savings and health benefits by time line although there should be more short term health benefits listed. After one month of not smoking you dont get any health goals for another year and then its 5 years and then 10 and 15. After a month, people will lost interest. Best to add many short term health benefits of not smoking. Other than that it's a good app.",
            "Great! I really recommend this app. It really helped me to see how well I'd done and when I felt weak for a cigarette, this really boosted me back where I needed to be. It tells you how much money and time you've saved, as well as health benefits and avoided toxins since you quit!",
            "This very simple app has really been that little extra support i needed. Quit cold turkey and to shy to reach out to ppl so... When it got rough i'd take a peek at my progress. Really helped cuz i would think how going for a smoke would flood me with remorse shame guilt and fristration by washing all the beautiful progress away. I am hard on myself so the progress reports helped me encourage myself and feel proud:) Thanks!!! :)",

I don't want to run some apps while any other programs are running for security reasons. This is why I am no longer using it. If you can tell me how to exit it without Force Stop or add an exit option to the menu I will reinstall it. Do that and it is absolutely 5 stars.",

It does exactly what I was looking for: No motivational tips, no prompts, just simple and reliable logs of cigarettes to help me keep an overview of how many times I've smoked so far. This way, it helps me stay away from having uncontrollably too many smokes and be mindful about whether I actually crave a cigarette or feel like smoking just due to specific triggers or out of certain habits.",

I am doing this therapy alongside of cessation medication (champix) and I feel like it has lessened the intensity of the cravings and anxiety associated with quitting. I like that it is only 18 mins as the other 30 mintute sessions I have tried are too long and I often fall asleep before the end. This guy's voice though... he's been my biggest support on this journey. Very helpful!",

(Learned from other apps that did not work as well in total) 6 Days smoke free! Almost no cravings after 30+ years of smoking! Best hypno-recording I have found!",

            "I was looking for an app that would help ween me off cigarettes. One that would notify me when I could have one and space them out. This does that but I can't tell IT when I've had one. So if I decide I want to wait and not have one, 45 minutes after the notification went off, another one goes off. It has not been helpful.",
            "Good idea and good app, helpful for those who struggle with cold turkey, this app unteaches you how to smoke so will help you break the habit and trigger parts. Just wish you could put in your own quit date, rather than selecting your set 7 or 30 days. I had a date in mind to quit and cant set it",

            "I paid for the app too fast. After 7 days of listening to same words again and again, the only motivation to not to smoke that I had was because I just didn't want to listen to it again and imagine that bloody elevator. I still smoked though. I only stopped thanks to Niquitin patches that I started using few weeks after I quit this app. The only good thing about it is that it gets so boring after few days that falling asleep is not an issue anymore",

Before I would have rushed to the shop the minute I ran out of cigs, I ran out last week and just carried on with my life. Smoke free finally!",

There could be more effort out into it, but there's also no ads or anything with this so keep that in mind cuz that's a pretty big deal too. Nobody wants to be annoyed AF waiting for stupid ads when they're tryna quit smokin.",

Not with internet, camera, gallery, and default is ugly. Pro's layout stinks in comparison; the original is better. Just mad. This used to be a great 5* app.",
            "It has been a very helpful incentive maker for me in my smoking cessation. I celebrate 9 months cigarette-free in a few days after nearly 20 years of smoking more than a pack a day. Very cool app.",
            "Love the concept of this app, love the name - its one of my favourites of the quitting smoking apps. Graphics are a little poor though, and could use a bit more motivational stuff throughout, also they need to continue with their name theme throughout, otherwise it has no connection to the actual App. SMOKE FREE is the best app of all"

            "Overall great, I have used it for 5 years, only downside is as I go longer without smoking don't need it as often so when I went in the update had erased all my data/progress which was a bit disappointing. Also the new badges are a bit silly used to have great goal related badges such as time and cigarettes not smoked, that helped when random cravings hit after years of not smoking, but who cares if you share on social media or use app for x hours. Not quite as good as it was originally.",
            "I really liked the original version of this app - it had lots of relevant goals and achievements that were quite motivating. The new badge system is ridiculous - it rewards the user purely based on how much they use and promote the app, rather than on smoking related issues. For those really struggling to keep motivated, \"congratulations, you've used this app 10 days in a row\" is not remotely helpful, whereas \"Congratulations, you've gained 10 more days life expectancy\" is much more effective.",
            "I've had this app for 3 years without issues. Then their latest update wiped my data and I lost everything and had to start over. Why couldn't you have migrated the data?",

            "This app is excellent. I look forward to opening it up and doing the challenges and activities.",
            "I used this in conjunction with another app called SmokeFree three years ago and quit after 15 years of smoking! Unfortunately due to new stress (obvious ones at that) I've started again and am once more using this and the other app to kick the habit. The only thing I would like different (and why I only gave four stars) is for the days to follow the time in your time zone and move forward to the next day at midnight!",
            "Hi l just installed your app . I'd like to suggest a different technic of quitting that you can add to your app . For example if someone smokes twice an hour , you can make a plan of smoking once an hour for some days and then once two hours and so on until no ciggaretts . Just saying 😊 ... Hi again i was just reading my message that l sent you more than a month ago .. now l am clean it's been one month and one day . I'd like to tell you thank you it wouldn't happen and be possible without you",
            "I like this app very much. Unlikely other apps to quit smoking this one gives you the right perspective and really understand your struggle and feelings. It keeps you engaged throughout the whole program, so you don't miss the focus on the final goal which is improve yourself and your life. Thank you very much for that! It'd be nice to have a diary section where to record thoughts (which is needed at the end of the program) and to consult the daily graph instead of see it once at the end of day."

It creates a personal dashboard showing how your health is improving, the money you've saved, and how long you've been a non-smoker (to the second!). Additionally, there is a chat feature (also free) where you can connect with people all over who are on this journey with you. Absolutely fantastic.",
            "simple and easy to use. i do wish it had a video game part like ive seen on other apps like this. they are really great for getting ya through a craving. also there doesnt seem to be a slip up function if you have one cigarette. but if youre looking for simple tracking this is it.",
            "got this to help support my partner. He was on thirty a day no filters for 18 years. breathing, coughing , snoring. everything was effected. couldn't stop previously, using patches for one week and this app He is now off them for three weeks. app gives you updated on stats and progress. It's excellent",
            "I love this App! Love the widget and the color themes. Needs a journal. Has a wonderful community. Private messaging would be nice. And a game distractor, for urges. This has been a big help for me on my quit Journey, being able to track my progress fully!❤",
            "Great app, simple and to the point. The best feature is the fact that you can see how your health improves in areas that might otherwise go unnoticed."

But one of the great features the cravings & slips part doesnt work! so instead of being proud that I'm having cravings but not slipping, it shows that im slipping every time I enter 0 in the slips category. Its discouraging instead of encouraging. Fix this & I'll give you 5 stars. otherwise it's enough to make me want to uninstall it and find another app."

You can keep a track of how many real cigarettes you replaced with a simulated one, and won't have to give up those smoke breaks.\r\nWant to quit smoking and you tried all the existing methods you have heard of? Quitting cold turkey didn't help me either, because after 2 or 3 days, I was back to buying a new pack of cigarettes and smoking half of it in one day, because I felt that I deserved to. \r\n\r\n But with this app, you can trick your brain into thinking that you are smoking, because:\r\n- App will tell you to synchronize your breathing with the virtual cigarette, so you get the feeling that you're still inhaling the smoke\r\n- Don't lose the flicking of the cigarette habit, because the app gives you the option to flick the ash off of it (also tricks are available)\r\n- The time spent for smoking the virtual cigarette is similar to the real one, so you still get those smoking breaks that you are used to\r\n- May not be for everyone, but if you still have a familiar feeling by seeing an ash tray, this is also included in the app :)\r\n- Get rewards when you replace enough cigarettes\r\n\r\nFor many people, the habit of smoking just boils down not to the tobacco or nicotine within the cigarettes, but the feeling that you are in charge of your time, or you take advantage of the time to reflect and to think about current issues or problems. Or either for socializing with other people :) No matter the purpose, every smoker who tries to quit will miss that feeling they had when they took a smoking break. \r\n\r\nIf you tried already giving up smoking, you know that you have to occupy your time with something to distract you, and to not think about lighting another cigarette. Well with this app, this would be easier, because it will occupy your time with something that you're already familiar with, the habbit of smoking without the cigarettes.\r\n\r\nTry it every time you go for a smoking break, and instead of lighting a real cigarette, start smoking one in the app, and there will be at least one cigarette less in your lungs, and one more in the app.\r\n\r\nGood luck quitting smoking! And remember, giving up bad habits is not actually quitting, because quitting is just a easy way out. What you are doing is remarkable!",

User Interface is very boring",

Other aps are pretty stupid on this front , who wants to see a cigerette when quitting ? Try it , just needs more achievements and pro mixed into correct catagory once u pay",

One with events it it would be possible for something like that. I've seen the diary may add dates and times with a notification that let's you remember to check it. Please and thank you for your efforts",
            "First thing when you open an app is guess what - an add. Then the app considers that you literally had your last drink or a cigarette right at the moment you are setting it up and there is no way to put another date and time. And yeah, basically wherever you click in the app you are gonna get, guess what - an add. In 10 mins of using this app ive probably spent 7 on watching adds. Tnx but i jave a tv for that.",

The only thing is it starts off the sobriety the minute you put in the tracker I have been sober abit longer even though i downloaded this app today it would be good to allow us to go back for how long we have been sober for. Otherwise great app",
            "I would love this app way more if there was more than just smoking and drinking. There agree other addictions out there. I'll be uninstalling this app until you guys decide to add that. Otherwise, I think that it is a wonderful app. I'll change my rating if the app gets more addictions added.",
            "Good tool... too many ads though. It's nice to see your progress in real time."

            "It helped me quit smoking along with nicotine replacement therapy and counseling sessions. It's worth the $20 but barely. Super glitchy and laggy. I'm glad I actually quit smoking before it started acting strange. Was fine at first but now it's barely usable. Definitely won't renew the subscription since I only use it now to track how long it's been since I smoked and how much money I've saved. I can do that with a calendar. TL;DR It helped but other things I did helped more. Barely usable now",
            "It was pretty buggy, but usually the ole close/reopen trick fixed it. The information and structure of the app was AWESOME. My only suggestion would be to add a \"how do you feel after smoking a cigarette\" section in the daily logs. Recognizing when it went from \"this makes me feel better\" to \"wow I feel dizzy, sick, and generally terrible\" was significant for me.",
            "Lack of transparency made me uninstall immediately. This is a paid app, you require money to use it. Not \"in app purchases,\" you must pay for the app period. What you do get for free is used storage space and an icon.",
            "Is not clear in any info on here before you download that this is a billed app, either monthly or yearly and that there is a free 7 day trial but only if you sign up for the yearly plan. Start being more transparent and you will get more people to download, pay, and use your app.",

            "This app is awesome!!!! NOTE: I start it with a few extra cigs a day so I can get in the habit of using the app to tell me when to smoke. As long as you stick to using this app you WILL quit smoking easy. The only issue I have is it crashes and locks up easy if you change the sounds to custom. This has been a problem for a very long time. You will have to uninstall and install it again sometime to get it to work again, otherwise its just locked ip. But again do not give up, this app works.",
            "Frustrated, the app keeps freezing or won't start up.... i really like how it tracks smoking but it never works longer than a day or 2. I have deleted 4 times .... ok please updated this app for newer phone and debug it please",
            "I loved this app at one point, but now it doesn't work, cant get rid of the bank it or smoke screen. This was a great app. PLEASE FIX!!!",
            "Actually it is the only good app on its category on the market, but the missing software menu button makes it impossible to use on newer phones. Can everyone with a LinkedIN account please contact the developer CHRIS DELLI SANTI JR and request an update. Maybe then he will reply to all the requests.",
            "This app goes black after a few days. Have to uninstall, and start all over. I did this numerous times because its a real simple app to use and i liked it. However, when it locks up, it causes me to smoke! lol. I have removed this app for the last time."

Theres no way to check in without purchasing. 1 star for seemingly forced purchase.",

I can't scroll through the text boxes in-app. I can see there is more in the box but I can't scroll to finish reading. Other than that it is wonderful! I would highly recommend payi g for the health tracking, that is my favorite part."

            "Excellent App !! It allows you not only to quit, as most 'quit now' apps do, but it also helps to reduce the tar per day/week/month, number of cigarettes, frequency as well as it offers mirriads of other features, such as brands of cigarettes, clear stats, etc. This has reduced my smoking habit by half. What could be better. It's a life/money/dependency saver.",
            "This app is actually really good. Rating one-star because I paid for the full version and contacted the developer because the export-import function is not working the app crashes when trying to export data and this is part of the paid version and does not work. Contacted the developer weeks ago and still have not received any help or response.",
            "This app is very good, allows you to set a quit date and gives guided cut down, records and logs your habit so you can see history graphs etc, great widgets so you can quickly add cigs, ability also to knock off, all in all a good app, the best one I've come across and trust me I've messed with a few on Google play, worth getting the pro for a couple of pound for the best widgets.",
            "Downloaded on September 7, 2019. Smoked 20 cigs a day at least. Today (September 10, 2019), smoked 10. Having that timer is awesome. Only app I have ever found to have one. Knowing how long since you've last had one, you keep pushing an extra 5-10 min. Would recommend to anyone trying to quit."

Not with internet, camera, gallery, and default is ugly. Pro's layout stinks in comparison; the original is better. Just mad. This used to be a great 5* app.",

I thought the community was supposed to be supportive, but it was toxic and hurtful. Unfortunately, it looks like the toxic posters were allowed to remain while the man suffering with relapse has been forced out. This is disgusting. This app is supposed to help people quit smoking. I want a refund.",

Now that I really am ready. Im honest about putting my best foot forward to complete this",

I feel like I'm losing my mind in this phase especially , but the tips on this app is awesome motivation to push through. Thanks guys. Excellent. Would recommend it to anyone wanting to quit!",
            "I really appreciate this app, there is tons of helpful information. I am only giving it 4 stars because when it pops up an ad for poker stars which is purposely hard to close and which also keeps going into my browser to open the website, it feels like this app is trying to guide me out of my cannibas addiction and into a gambling addiction. That's kinda messed up, or at least has bad optics 🤷‍♂️",
            "I've literally never written an app review in my entire life. But there is so much understanding and kindness built into this app. You're able to read through tips and symptoms you're experiencing, and click through to resources or to read more. You'll find little helpful links and anecdotes sprinkled throughout, and ads are minimal and easily skippable. Feels like it was made with no other motivation but to genuinely help others.",
            "I couldn't hold myself accountable enough to quit alone, but this app helps keep me on track. Every time I want to cave I go look at my \"streak\" and just seeing the number counting up is enough. The achievements come at the best times to explain how your body is returning back to normal and show your progress in percentages to how long you have until your body is THC clear for example, or your memory rebounds. Really amazing app."

My quit date is October 13, 2020 so I'm just getting prepped and familiar with my new friend/app Will let you know how it goes. ***My initial impression of this app was that of minor disappointment since I bought the Pro version I expected there to be more, instead it's oh so very simple and unimpressive. I thought..If this is the paid app version I'd hate to see the free version.",
            "Absolutely love this app, it really does make all the difference motivationally by providing the incremental progress you've made from day to day. From how much you've saved financially to how many health benefits you've regained, it gives you that tangible baseline to view your progress visually and in real time. It's also simple and automatic, imputing your information is effortless and it will do all the calculations and busy work for you, then provide you will little \"rewards\" & incentives!",
            "Good distraction for the most part.",
            "Best quitting app and worth the money for PRO. Remember that quitting isn't just something that you do from 1 day to the next. You got to plan and commit. Chewing gum, patches, Chantix, etc... Can help but what really matters is your WILL POWER! I suggest to the developer that after you complete a health goal there is also a timer for how long ago you completed the goal. I think that would be cool to know also.",
            "Love this app. It helped me to quit smoking on July 14, 2019. It keeps track of how many cig. not smoked, ect. It has a chat room to talk to other people who are quitting smoking."

            "so the app is great however I only gave 3 stars because of the \"end of day\" thing.. surely this could be done automatically with the implementation of a clock? or Eg: Start day: 00:00. End Day 23:59 or just a 'pick your timezone' kind of thing so it just does it by itself.. cause at 3am in the morning when I'm drowsy and having that last smoke before falling asleep I won't remember to end the day on the app. Just a thought :)",
            "Perfect for chain smokers or, like me, tend to lose track of how long it's been since my last cigarette. I'm on my 3rd day of tracking now but see how this app is really useful for simple folks who are ready to take back control. Marios Zoutis, Thank you! I'm not sure if you read these reviews, I am very grateful for your gift and decided to give it 5 stars in hopes of helping others. 20 to 22 per day right now.",
            "Installed this app and every time I unlocked my phone there was ads saying \"slide to unlock\". its really weird. never seen an app do that before. its the only appi installed that day and as soon as i uninstalled and restarted my phone the message didnt come up again.",
            "Works! Easy to use.. Good to stay aware of how many one does actually smoke and even more so the time in between each.. I failed at quitting 100x but with this I'm confident I can challenge myself and reduce bit by bit... Thank you",
            "Easy to use & simple to understand. No bells & whistles. Suitable for all smokers."

There is potential to be a high 4s app but like most things, the Australian Government don't really care.",
            "This app is very helpful. I have not quit smoking but thanks to the saying, Every cigarette you don't smoke is doing you good, I have had over 200 less cigarettes this week than I would have usually smoked. I feel like I am getting closer to quitting every day. The health information is fantastic, the suggestions of distractions instead of smoking are good, and the notes and goal section is great too. This app is very positive in out look.",
            "This app used to be great when I quit a year or so ago. Now it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. update: seriously guys you need to fix this. when a smoker comes to this app looking for support for not smoking and the app doesn't work, it's more of a hindrance than a help. some examples I've noticed: \"distract me\" only works twice then crashes the app (used to have games? but no more); the community forum scrolling is all wonky; the app only opens for me every second attempt; etc etc"

If you decide to stop cold turkey you have the option to skip the reducing program.\r\n\r\nThis app will support you with all kinds of extra stimulants by setting goals (for instance financially) which you can use as an incentive and reward yourself.\r\nThis app will also show statistics and graphs which will make you aware of your smoking out of habit rather then dependence.\r\n\r\nYou will see badges when you have reached your set goals and even health stats when stopped smoking completely.\r\n\r\nYou have the option to stop smoking together with your partner or friend(s) and compare your results by sharing your stats and graphs to motivate each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does reducing work?\r\nThe app will need 3 full days of input of your smoking behaviour to be able to calculate your personal reduce program. So these first 3 you just click the 'smoke a cigarette' button when you light a cigarette.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day you will have a set delay time between your cigarettes. For example 20 minutes. Within these 20 minutes you will see a red screen, with a timer. To fully benefit your reduce program you have to wait for the timer before you smoke your next cigarette. However if the you really need a cigarette and you can not wait for these few minutes to pass you will be able to smoke a 'penalty' cigarette. (Tip don't smoke more than 2 a day.)\r\nEvery 3 days the program recalculates your cigarette delay time, based on the smoked cigarettes, and the amount of penalty cigarettes. \r\nYou will get 3 choices for your next reduce step; easy, recommended and difficult.\r\nWhen you have reached an amount under 8 cigarettes average in the past 3 days, it's time to stop. \r\n\r\nThe best proven working method of stopping is picking a date in the near future, as the first cigarette free day.\r\nInform your friends and family you are planning to quit and ask their support.",

            "This app is fantastic. It is very motivating to reduce smoking for the reward it suggests buying yourself once enough money is saved. It is simple and easy to use. Every small achievement of one less cigarette smoked is seen as the amount smoked per day is compared in a chart. The app shows the whole journey of quitting from where a person is in the beginning to the amount of cigarettes smoked on the current day. Once the amount you smoke is calculated a delay can be set for longer times.",
            "I really like this app but it would be much better if I could tell it I'm only smoking half of a cigarette, and go back and fix mistakes from the amount of cigarettes a day. I've never counted how many I smoke and after using the app I realized I was way off but couldn't fix it without deleting the app and starting over.",

I like their happy faces and can relate to them, so  it makes me want to keep them happy.    This makes the app works for me. I am two weeks without a smoke.  Do they have friends that can be added to the rewards or goals? I have a Samsung Core phone and have no problems with the app functioning properly."

However there are some things I am not a fan of with it. First, unless I quit the app completely after I log something it will randomly pop back up to no matter what I'm doing which is annoying. Second, there doesn't seem to be a way to look back at previous day's. Also a widget would be handy.",
            "The app itself is clean and easy to use. It is not completely free however. $7.99 a month is VERY excessive for an app of this type. I would be much more inclined to buy it if it were a one time payment for a \"pro\" unlock. Unfortunately, I will have to uninstall, as the free version of this app just doesn't quite live up to what I would expect.",
            "Super easy to use, offers much better features than other quit smoking apps. I suggest getting the monthly subscription to get the full benefits.",
            "Can't try it yet, won't connect to google Please help, the app won't connect to google. Trying to use paid feature. Please fix & I'll rate 5 stars!!! Thank you",
            "As a former person who vapes and smokes, I love being able to track both my e-cigarettes and cigarettes usage.. I also used nicotine gum and can track that too."

            "I have a few of Andrew Johnsons apps that i love. This one is glitchy though and cuts mid intro to the main section with is very unrelaxing. I actually would advise not to buy because of that. Also reading back in other reviews it sends to be a problem for 2+ years. That's bad form",

        "description": "Smoking causes cancer, breathing problems, heart attacks, and stroke. Secondhand smoke causes asthma and breathing problems. Support groups, nicotine replacement therapy, and other medications can help you quit.\r\nReady to quit smoking?\r\nWe all know the health risks of smoking, but that doesn’t make it any easier to kick the habit. Whether you’re an occasional teen smoker or a lifetime pack-a-day smoker, quitting can be really tough.\r\n\r\nSmoking tobacco is both a physical addiction and a psychological habit. The nicotine from cigarettes provides a temporary—and addictive—high. Eliminating that regular fix of nicotine causes your body to experience physical withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Because of nicotine’s “feel good” effect on the brain, you may turn to cigarettes as a quick and reliable way to boost your outlook, relieve stress, and unwind. Smoking can also be a way of coping with depression, anxiety, or even boredom. Quitting means finding different, healthier ways to cope with those feelings.\r\n\r\nSmoking is also ingrained as a daily ritual. It may be an automatic response for you to smoke a cigarette with your morning coffee, while taking a break at work or school, or on your commute home at the end of a hectic day. Or maybe your friends, family, or colleagues smoke, and it’s become part of the way you relate with them.\r\n\r\nTo successfully stop smoking, you’ll need to address both the addiction and the habits and routines that go along with it. But it can be done. With the right support and quit plan, any smoker can kick the addiction—even if you’ve tried and failed multiple times before.",

I was coughing all the time and weezing while breathing and finally had had enough and went cold turkey .Ive never felt better and actually feel high on life . Belive me , if I can do it so can you . Thank you developers you help save my life ..",
            "It constantly asks you to buy it. The free version is extremely limited and full of ads. If i get a notification, i cannot access it because it immediately sends me to the purchase screen when i try to view it. I do not recommend this app for quitting, it will just cause frustration and make you want to smoke even more.",
            "The only app you should use when trying to refrain or completely quit cannabis use. For the users complaining about paying for the premium version is bs. The free version keeps track of the time you have quit as well as some helpful tips which is all you really need in my opinion. Thank you for creating this.",
            "Would've given this an easy 5 stars, but it is so incredibly buggy compared to the iOS version. I have both and the android app constantly messes up. Main issue is showing me tobacco achievements when I don't and have never utilized the tobacco counter function."

        "description": "SiS (“Smiling Instead of Smoking”) is an app that engages you in daily positive psychology exercises over the course of 7 weeks, and assigns ‘behavioral challenges’ every 2-4 days to coach you through the steps towards smoking cessation.  This is an app designed by scientists based on existing evidence and clinical guidelines regarding smoking cessation [https://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/clearing-the-air].  The effectiveness of this app will be tested, as funded by a grant from the American Cancer Society [https://www.cancer.org/].  The key innovation of this app is its use of positive psychology, which is a promising new approach to smoking cessation [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4612345/].  The happiness exercises used in this app have been fully vetted [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547218303349], and the app provides scientific facts and insights along the way (i.e., “Owl Wisdoms”).  Our goal is to inform and empower, while engaging you in daily practices that enhance and/or maintain your happiness, while you undertake the challenge of quitting smoking.\r\n\r\nHow Well Does It Work?\r\n\r\nThe app you are downloading is Version 2 of this app.  It builds on the feedback received by participants in a study evaluating Version 1 of the app [https://www.iproc.org/2018/2/e11762/], who found the app easy to use and useful, and whose confidence to quit smoking increased, and urge to smoke decreased.  Thirty percent of study participants were biochemically confirmed to be abstinent from smoking 2 weeks after their chosen quit day, and 6 months after the chosen quit day, 55% of study participants reported having been abstinent from smoking for the past 30 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Using This App You Support Science\r\n\r\nOver the next year, we will gather data and feedback on this version of the app.  Based on this information, we will further improve and streamline this app, and then test its effectiveness in a randomized clinical trial.  By using this app, you are providing valuable data to us.  As you use the app, and if you permit it, we will log how you use the app (e.g., percent of days on which you completed a happiness exercise, number of behavioral challenges you completed) to give us an idea of how well this app works.  We are also conducting a 2nd study on how using this app impacts smoking cessation (if you want to join the study, find more information here [https://scholar.harvard.edu/bettina.hoeppner/sis]).  Beyond these two ways of providing us with valuable data and feedback, you could also simply email us and share your thoughts and feedback – we would love to hear from you!  To provide feedback, simply email the study team (sis@mgh.harvard.edu) or the principal investigator for this app directly, Dr. Bettina Hoeppner (bhoeppner@mgh.harvard.edu).\r\n\r\nGood luck with your quit attempt!  Quitting smoking is critically important to your health – including quitting occasional smoking.  We hope this app will make you smile along the way, and support you in reaching your goal.\r\n\r\nKey words\r\n    • Happiness\r\n    • Smoking \r\n    • Cigarette\r\n    • Quitting \r\n    • Science\r\n    • Positive psychology\r\n    • American Cancer Society\r\n    • Harvard Medical School",

They end up becoming very complacent and don't live up to their full potential.\r\n \r\n3. Being Energetic\r\n \r\nAs you age, marijuana starts to take a toll on your body in many ways. Smoking pot to overcome mundane tasks is why you may have started in the first place, but after a while, your lungs will start to clog and your blood flow will slow. \r\n \r\n4. Having better eating habits\r\n \r\nEveryone knows that smoking marijuana speeds up your metabolism, which in turn makes you very hungry. This is commonly known as the munchies. No matter what type of foods you are eating, you are still putting a damper on your overall health and digestive tract.\r\n \r\n5. Having clean lungs\r\n \r\nThere has been conflicting research about the negative effects of smoking weed, but the unanimous agreement is that you are still inhaling smoke. Chronic use can lead to emphysema, cancer, and other serious health issues.\r\n \r\n6. Living life by the laws\r\n \r\nThe longer you smoke weed, the more chances you have of running into trouble with the law. Sure, the growing trend of legalization makes us more brazen about marijuana smoking, but possession is still illegal in most states and STILL a federal crime no matter what. \r\n \r\n7. Personal safety\r\n \r\nIs your drug dealer really your friend? He may appear to be, but somewhere along his supply chain, there is some serious illegal activity going on. People who engage in illegal activity are more likely to commit violent crimes which you don't want to be caught in the middle of.\r\n \r\n \r\n.... Why wait on getting help?

            "I have used other quit apps over the years. I like how you can track and notate your cravings; it is built for Canadians vs US audiences. A big down-side is that it feels very static, which sucks as I quit. The clock, number of cigarettes, money saved, etc. are all static and only update once every 24 hours. Quit Nation had a more lively feedback mechanic in terms of showing me my progress. In the end, this one is fine for quitting, but there are better options for an app. Needs more action.",
            "it's a useful and convenient app without any ads or whatnot, but I think the UI could use a little work (especially the color contrast in certain pages like the savings goal where there is white text over a yellow background). I think you could greatly benefit from opening the source code up to the general public, as I'm sure I'm not the only one who wouldn't mind spending some time improving this.",
            "I like this app I just wish I could go back and edit things on previous days in calendar. Like if I slipped the night before but didnt get to enter it. Or when I input a slip or craving be able to edit the time it happened if I enter app a bit later. It would make for a more accurate look back at my progress and setbacks. I'll update my review when that is updated.",
            "I really like this app! It's nice to see how much money I saved. It's also nice that the app tells me how I'm doing. My friends don't understand how difficult quitting is so it's nice that I get some recognition.",
            "Mathematics are all wrong on calculating time and money. Disappointed because it's a Canadian app. Was hoping to be proud of it, but I'm not. I ended up deleting it, sorry."

        "title": "Steps to Quit Smoking",
        "description": "Be realistic in your expectations about quitting smoking. It's not easy but it's not impossible. Millions of people quit smoking every year. Smoking may be common, but it can be broken, it may be addictive, but it can be cured.\r\n\r\n• Symptoms of withdrawal of nicotine \"temporary\", a health symptom that indicates the passage of the body in the stage of repair and recovery after a long period of exposure to nicotine and smoke toxins.\r\n\r\n• Avoid negative emotions and thoughts about how difficult it is to quit smoking.

If the app was more quitting friendly instead of those that have quit completely I would gladly give you 5 stars",
            "Got this thing as a birthday gift and wasn't able to use it because the app didn't work. I check again with my new Pixel to see if it works now, four months later, and I'm only able to get to the page where it asks when your quit date was and what products you're interested in. Then the next page says no internet connection available even though I'm connected to WiFi.",

            "Was working a month ago, no longer works with current update. Samsung Galaxy S10+ Still no fix months later. App still crashes on startup. Have already left feedback from the app 3 times and nothing has been done. Do not use this app, you will loose all of your progress."

Приложение - счетчик, которое поможет бросить курить раз и навсегда. В нем вы наглядно будет мотивированы ежедневно обновляемыми показаниями: какую сумму вы сэкономили, бросив курить, а также, на сколько при этом вы продлили свою жизнь. Для расчета сэкономленной суммы, вам будет необходимо ввести свои данные: сколько в среднем сигарет вы курили ежедневно  и какова средняя цена за одну пачку сигарет, с которыми вы решили расстаться. Для расчета продолжительности жизни были использованы усредненные медицинские статистические данные, с учетом ввода ваших данных о выкуренных сигаретах в день. Бесплатно и никакой рекламы, разве не повод сегодня установить приложение и удивиться сэкономленному времени и деньгам?

        "description": "Good News!\r\n\r\nYou WILL Stop Smoking with this new App.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: ONLY Android 6.0 or early versions \r\n(NEW UPDATED VERSION SOON)\r\n\r\n1- You don't need fancy graphics\r\n2- You don't neet 25 screens and options to choose from.\r\n3- You need this to be simple & effective\r\n4- You just need ONE thing, To Get this App now. \r\n\r\nThis App is to allow you to hear a Brain Sync Stop Smoking Brainwave Mediation for Concentration. You will quit smoking, like others have already done it before. It really made a difference. \r\n\r\nBrain Sync Audio Technology is a Binaural beats meditation.\r\n\r\n•Cravings reduced significantly\r\n•Inner Resolve Strengthened\r\n•Symptoms of Withdrawal Minimized\r\n\r\nHave you tried to quit smoking numerous times unsuccessfully? Try Brain Sync's Stop Smoking because you can do it and succeed now. With the precision-engineered brain wave frequencies, you enter into a state of hyper-receptivity and embedded subliminal messages get to the root of self-sabotage. \r\n\r\nTrigger messages help reduce cravings, strengthen resolve, developing a new and health sense of self, free from the hold of nicotine addiction. \r\n\r\nYour unlimited power of the subconscious is activated as a hyper-receptive state is induced by specific brain wave frequencies. In this state, new self-empowering beliefs are firmly imprinted into the unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADPHONES REQUIRED - Note: As this session stimulates each ear with different frequencies, you will need to use headphones to experience the full effect. \r\n\r\nHow Loud Should The Volume Be?\r\n\r\nThere is varying advice and opinions on the impact of volume with brainwave entrainment, with some saying the louder it is the more impact it has. From my own experience, my advice is to play it at a volume level you feel comfortable with. The main thing to consider is that it should be loud enough to hear the repetitive isochronic tones. So you don't want it so quiet you can hardly hear them. But you also don't want it so loud that its uncomfortable for you. Somewhere in the middle is my recommendation. \r\n\r\nHow To Use This?\r\n\r\nUse this session in the morning or afternoon, to train your brain for better cognition, such as clearer and faster thinking. You can either sit somewhere quiet with your eyes closed and give your brain a nice workout, or you can also listen to this while doing an activity that requires a boost in concentration thinking power boost for.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is not recommended to listen to this while driving, operating machinery, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\r\n\r\nThis session stimulates Beta, SMR and Alpha, alternating in 2 minute increments to help keep the user relaxed and engaged. \r\n\r\nNote: SMR (sensorimotor rhythm) relates to the frequency range between 12 - 15Hz. It's associated with sensory processing and motor control. Stimulating this can result in relaxed focus and improved attention.\r\n\r\nThis session is meant to speed up the brain while keeping the left hemisphere dominant (good for attention, concentration and reducing emotional response and hyperactivity). ADD and similar disorders are often characterized by \"slow-wave\" EEG patterns, particularly in the left frontal region. As such, this session stimulates the left brain hemisphere with Beta frequencies and the right with SMR.\r\n\r\nThis recording contains the following subliminal messages:\r\n\r\n•With every breath I choose health\r\n•All my desires are fulfilled\r\n•I am free, I feel great\r\n•I am completely relaxed\r\n•It's easy to let go, I love my body\r\n•I am clear and focused\r\n•I honor my lungs, I respect my health\r\n•I fill my lungs with life-giving energy\r\n•I am secure and content\r\n•It's easy for me to choose health\r\n•I am willing to change\r\n•I am committed to my physical well-being\r\n•I am in control of my desires\r\n•I have willpower\r\n•I am strong, I succeed\r\n•I am different now, I release the past with respect\r\n•New opportunity exists in every moment\r\n•I achieve my goals, my resolve is strong\r\n•I welcome my new life\r\n•I follow my inner wisdom\r\n•I am healthy",

But smoking is a subconscious reaction to different triggers and a habit that we have developed over a long time.

It will recondition all your thoughts you currently have about smoking.\r\n\r\nThe audio program starts off with a brief relaxation process with the sound of crashing waves in the background. After the relaxation period, you will hear the re-programming statements or affirmations, each one purposefully repeated three times. The affirmations are stated in the first person, present tense.\r\n\r\nFind a place where you can relax undisturbed and with no interruptions for approximately 20 minutes. Sit or lie down in a comfortable position, loosen any tight clothing. Put your ear/headphones on and press the play button.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the session. At the end of the 20 minutes, the sound of the crashing waves simply fades, giving you the choice to either continue relaxing or going to sleep, or waking up.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you listen to this audio upon awakening, at bedtime and sometime during the day for at least 30 days.\r\n\r\nPlease eliminate the usage of the following words for the next six months: cigarette, smoke, smoking, matches or any other words that relate or remind you of smoking. The words just mentioned contain the thought of smoking, which is what you will want to eliminate from your thinking.\r\n\r\nAll meaningful change in life begins from within.\r\n\r\n*** Please Note: This session was created by my colleague Hani Al-Qasem. We are teaming up to offer a wider range of products to help more people.\r\n\r\nHani Al-Qasem is a published author and personal growth specialist. His vision is to use his creativity and caring for others to inspire, motivate and support adults and children to be the very best that they can be by freely expressing their talents in a harmonious and loving way. He actively creates awareness of his vision through his writings that are published in various reputable online and offline publications, and through the life-transforming tools that he has created.\r\n\r\n*Please use headphones for best results\r\n*Do not operate heavy machinary when listening",
