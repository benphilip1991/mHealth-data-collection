As it it is considered a medical device that poses minimal risk to patients and consumers, it falls under the FDA exercise enforcement discretions. For more information, please visit the relevant section the official FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/mobile-medical-applications/examples-mobile-apps-which-fda-will-exercise-enforcement-discretion\r\n\r\nTo use this application, create an account and enter the requested information in the different tabs as accurately and completely as you can. All information that is requested will influence your risk for at least one type of cancer, so the more complete and accurate the information you enter, the more dependable the results. Age, gender and racial background are critical, all other information is optional. The results will appear after you have completed the last tab and can always be revisited by tapping your name. You can also edit the information you submitted to see how this influences your results.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime probabilities of developing cancers were based on USA data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, collected since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), collected since 1995. These figures were adapted by the hazard ratios available in the published peer-reviewed literature. Only risk factors with a quantifiable risk were included. Risk factors requiring complex tests not available to the average clinician were excluded. Meta-analyses were given preference when available.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This application is strictly educational and all information contained herein cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician. The evaluations presented represent our best efforts to conveniently assess cancer risk. However, as significant controversy and widely different study results can persist around the impact of even a single variable in a strictly selected population, this is based on a large number of assumptions, extrapolations and estimates. As not every study includes a multivariate analysis and the effect of some risk factors on certain cancers is so large their effect cannot be eliminated from basic probability, a bias toward overestimation of risk is possible. Furthermore, there is continuous progress in the scientific literature. Any figures should therefore be regarded as indicative, but not precise.\r\nAny information you enter into this application will only be stored on your device and will never be sent to us or to any other party, for any reason.\r\n\r\nAll research and medical support for this application was done by Dr. Philippe Westerlinck, radiation oncologist and clinical chair at the University Hospital of Liège, superspecialising in gastro-intestinal, lung and breast cancers.",

All information that is requested will influence your risk for at least one type of cancer, so the more complete and accurate the information you enter, the more dependable the results. Age, gender and racial background are critical, all other information is optional. The results will appear after you have completed the last tab and can always be revisited by tapping your name. You can also edit the information you submitted to see how this influences your results.<br><br>The lifetime probabilities of developing cancers were based on USA data from the National Cancer Institute&#39;s (NCI&#39;s) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, collected since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#39;s (CDC&#39;s) National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), collected since 1995. These figures were adapted by the hazard ratios available in the published peer-reviewed literature. Only risk factors with a quantifiable risk were included. Risk factors requiring complex tests not available to the average clinician were excluded. Meta-analyses were given preference when available.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: This application is strictly educational and all information contained herein cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician. The evaluations presented represent our best efforts to conveniently assess cancer risk. However, as significant controversy and widely different study results can persist around the impact of even a single variable in a strictly selected population, this is based on a large number of assumptions, extrapolations and estimates. As not every study includes a multivariate analysis and the effect of some risk factors on certain cancers is so large their effect cannot be eliminated from basic probability, a bias toward overestimation of risk is possible. Furthermore, there is continuous progress in the scientific literature. Any figures should therefore be regarded as indicative, but not precise.<br>Any information you enter into this application will only be stored on your device and will never be sent to us or to any other party, for any reason.<br><br>All research and medical support for this application was done by Dr. Philippe Westerlinck, radiation oncologist and clinical chair at the University Hospital of Liège, superspecialising in gastro-intestinal, lung and breast cancers.",

I often get notifications on my phone about new postings but when go to the app they do not come up. I have to try to manipulate the app several times to get the latest post. Also once a request has been posted & responded to you can't offer your help. If a person asks for prayer more than one person should be able to respond. App should be more advanced",
            "Seriously, I'd give it 0 stars. Just downloaded the app, went through the tutorial, and none of the buttons do anything. Tried to add to my circle, kept hitting the prompt and nothing happened. Same with resources, the calendar, tracking my mood/pain/etc, sending requests... nothing works! Pointless. When you're going through chemo/cancer treatment, and your solicited an app that's supposed to \"help,\" it's very discouraging when the app does nothing it's supposed to do.",
            "I tried multiple tines to install the app and got stopped at a number of points along the way and despite all efforts - this with a background in usability as a former product development manager in the Internet market - including a password reset email that began with a personal greeting to someone who is not me and yet is now, disturbingly, linked to my primary email address somewhere in their database. And there's more. I would recommend waiting to see if they respond before installing.",
            "It seems like this is a content syndicator that grows by you \"connecting with loved ones\" by sending out invites. I put in that I have brain cancer and the first article is about how someone survived mastectomy. Some articles just link out to third party sites and services. So what is this app, delete.",
            "I'm just starting....but love the concept but I'm surprised there is no calendar to jot down your appts when they are scheduled....that would really make it 100%. Otherwise I have to go to Calender...when I could just one stop shop with the app"

        "description": "How long is the human colon?\r\nThe human large intestine (colon) is about 6 feet long.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is colorectal cancer?\r\nCancers of the colon and rectum (colorectal cancer) start when the process of the normal replacement of colon lining cells goes awry. Mistakes in cell division occur frequently. For reasons that are poorly understood, sometimes mistakes occur that escape our editing systems. When this occurs, these cells begin to divide independently of the normal checks and balances that control growth. As these abnormal cells grow and divide, they can lead to growths within the colon called polyps. Polyps vary in type, but many are precancerous tumors that grow slowly over the course of years and do not spread. As polyps grow, additional genetic mutations further destabilize the cells. When these precancerous tumors change direction (growing into the wall of the tube rather than into the space in the middle of it) and invade other layers of the large intestine (such as the submucosa or muscular layer), the precancerous polyp has become cancerous. In most cases this process is slow, taking at least eight to 10 years to develop from those early aberrant cells to a frank cancer.\r\n\r\nOnce a colorectal cancer forms, it begins to grow in two ways. First, the cancer can grow locally and extend through the wall of the intestine and invade adjacent structures, making the mass (called the primary tumor) more of a problem and harder to remove. Local extension can cause additional symptoms such as pain or fullness, perforation of the colon, or blockages of the colon or nearby structures. Second, as the cancer grows it begins the process of metastasis, shedding thousands of cells a day into the blood and lymphatic system that can cause cancers to form in distant locations. Colorectal cancers most commonly spread first to local lymph nodes before traveling to distant organs. Once local lymph nodes are involved, spread to the liver, the abdominal cavity, and the lung are the next most common destinations of metastatic spread.\r\n\r\nColorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer in the U.S. in both men and women. It affects almost 135,000 people annually, representing 8% of all cancers. About 4.4% of people will be diagnosed with colon or rectum cancer at some point in their lives\r\npour savoir plus entre ici....",

When it comes to a diet rich in cancer-fighting substances, most experts agree that it should consist of a predominantly plant-based diet. \"If you have two-thirds of plant food on your plate, that seems to be enough to avoid excessive amounts of food high in saturated fat. That seemingly simple advice could mean a drastic change in diet for many people.\r\n\r\nPeople who are thinking that this is like a diet, and are trying to choke this stuff down, it's never going to last. You're looking at creating something for a lifetime. If it takes you awhile, but each month or so you enjoy [one more vegetable], then that's great.\r\n\r\nThe extracts from cruciferous vegetables as well as those from vegetables of the genus Allium inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines whereas extracts from vegetables most commonly consumed in Western countries were much less effective. The antiproliferative effect of vegetables was specific to cells of cancerous origin and was found to be largely independent of their antioxidant properties. These results thus indicate that vegetables have very different inhibitory activities towards cancer cells and that the inclusion of cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive strategies.\r\n\r\nTranslation:\r\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies stopped cancer growth.\r\n- Commonly consumed vegetables did not work as well.\r\n- The antioxidant content of veggies was not a key anti-cancer factor.\r\n- Different vegetables work for different cancers.\r\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies should be eaten to prevent cancer.\r\nSo the most commonly consumed vegetables in Western countries had very little effect on cancer cell growth. The top three (potatoes, lettuce and carrots) account for 60% of the vegetables we Westerners are eating. 32% of our vegetable intake is potatoes, and half of that is actually french fries. Dark greens, cruciferous veggies and garlic account for less than 1% of our Western diet!\r\n\r\nRadishes were shown to stop tumor growth by 95-100% for breast and stomach cancer, but had no effect and may have even increased tumor growth by 20-25% in pancreatic, brain, lung and kidney cancer. Definitely something to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nYou may want to start with some of the following food substances, all of which show promise as cancer-fighting agents.\r\n\r\nTake this list to your next grocery visit, and stock up on these cancer fighting ingredients.

        "description": "What is Blood Cancer?\r\n\r\nBlood Cancer is a cancer that originates in blood stem cells. Stem cells are basic cells that transform into different types of cells that have distinct functions.\r\n\r\nBlood stem cells become lymphoid stem cells or myeloid stem cells.\r\n\r\n    Lymphoid stem cells turn into lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Lymphocytes help fight infections and destroy abnormal cells. The three types of lymphocytes are B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (NK).\r\n    Myeloid stem cells become red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes or platelets. Red blood cells transport oxygen to all tissues in the body. Granulocytes and monocytes are types of white blood cells that destroy bacteria and help fight infections. Platelets form clots in damaged blood vessels to stop bleeding.\r\n\r\nBy developing, blood stem cells become blast cells (blasts), which are immature blood cells. In the case of leukemia, there is an overproduction of blast cells. These blast cells develop abnormally and do not become mature blood cells. Over time, blast cells take the place of normal blood cells, preventing them from performing their tasks. When leukemia is diagnosed, these blast cells can be called leukemic cells.\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of leukemias. They are first classified according to the type of blood stem cell from which they develop. The lymphocytic leukemia (also called lymphoblastic leukemia) originates in the abnormal lymphoid stem cells. Myeloid leukemia (also called myelogenous leukemia) comes abnormal myeloid stem cells.\r\n\r\nThe types of leukemias are then subdivided according to the speed at which the disease develops and evolves. Acute leukemia begins suddenly and develops in a few days or weeks. Chronic leukemia develops slowly over months or even years.\r\n\r\nThe four main types of leukemia are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).\r\n\r\nIn adults, the most common leukemias are CLL and AML.

Worldwide 1.7 million women were diagnosed in 2012. But the good news is: Breast cancer can be treated. The earlier a cancer disease is detected, the better it can be treated.\r\n\r\nCancer is one of the diseases most feared by everyone because cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, as is breast cancer that most women are worried about.\r\n\r\nBreast cancer is cancer of the breast tissue which is the most common type of cancer that affects women.

            "The app looks extremely useful, but here are points that need fixing: profile pics are by default displayed at a 90° rotation. Body temperature has three digits in Celcius but should only have two. (Sent to the extremely nice and helpful support, thank you for your answer!)",
            "Looks super useful but can't input temozolomide's 5days on 23days off cycle. Probably better support for other cancers, but that's a deal breaker for brain cancer. Also, probably should differentiate between cancer symptoms and medication side effects. There is no way to input side effects in the past. When I am feeling sick, the last thing I want to do is mess with the phone. For heavy reactions, input is going to be retroactive, so good to support that I think."

        "description": "Cancer is not one disease, but a collection of related diseases that can occur almost anywhere in the body. At its most basic, cancer is a disease of the genes in the cells of our body. Genes control the way our cells work. But, changes to these genes can cause cells to malfunction, causing them to grow and divide when they should not—or preventing them from dying when they should. These abnormal cells can become cancer.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how genetic changes cause cancer is one way to understand this disease, while cancer statistics is another. Cancer statistics help scientists understand the burden of cancer on society. Statistics can tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year and the number of people who are living after a cancer diagnosis. Changes in statistics over time can help scientists find areas where progress is needed.\r\n\r\nCancer statistics also help scientists understand cancer health disparities. Examples of disparities include the higher cancer death rates, less frequent use of proven screening tests, and higher rates of advanced cancer diagnoses that are found in certain groups of people.\r\n\r\nUnderstand how cancer cells differ from normal cells and genetics changes that cause cancer to grow and spread.\r\n\r\nBasic information about cancer statistics in the U.S. and how they are used to understand the impact of cancer on society and to develop strategies that address the challenges that cancer poses.\r\n\r\nCertain groups bear an unequal burden of cancer.

Breast cancer can be categorised by whether it is non-invasive or invasive. Breast cancer is also categorised by how advanced the disease is into early, locally-advanced and metastatic. Breast cancer can be classified into subtypes based on hormonal and HER2 receptor status as follows: luminal A-like (ER and PgR positive, HER2 negative tumours), luminal B-like (ER and/or PgR positive, HER2 positive or negative tumours), HER2 overexpressing (ER and PgR negative, HER2 positive tumours) and basal-like (triple-negative tumours). It is important for determining the breast cancer treatment.\r\n\r\nThe app of Breast Cancer Survival Manual provides essential updates on treatment and care, enhancing the basic information that has made this the most trusted guide for women diagnosed with breast cancer for the past two decades. This  includes the most current advice on:\r\n· The new genomic classification of breast cancer and its importance in treatment planning\r\n· Cancer gene testing, which determines if a woman will benefit from chemotherapy\r\n· New developments in breast cancer treatments with new targeted agents\r\n· The continued importance of getting a second opinion: why it’s important, what questions to ask, and how to decide which team of doctors is best for you.\r\n\r\nConscious of the rapidly evolving spectrum of treatment options, the app Link outlines the latest findings and professional wisdom for patients in pursuit of the most effective treatment plan for them. The Breast Cancer Survival Manual continues to be a must-have for any woman seeking accurate and accessible information about managing breast cancer today.\r\n\r\nBreast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.\r\n\r\nSubstantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

These growths are called polyps.\r\n\r\nSome types of polyps can change into cancer over time (usually many years), but not all polyps become cancer.

Because of this, adenomas are called a pre-cancerous condition.\r\nHyperplastic polyps and inflammatory polyps: These polyps are more common, but in general they are not pre-cancerous.\r\n\r\nOther factors that can make a polyp more likely to contain cancer or increase someone’s risk of developing colorectal cancer include:\r\n\r\nIf a polyp larger than 1 cm is found\r\nIf more than 2 polyps are found\r\nIf dysplasia is seen in the polyp after it's removed.

        "title": "Breast Cancer",
        "description": "Breast cancer is a disease in which cancerous (or malignant) cells develop uncontrollably in the breast tissue (usually in ducts - tubes that carry milk to the nipple - or in the lobules - the milk producing glands). It is the most common type of cancer seen in women and the leading cause of death.\r\nTypes of breast cancer\r\n\r\nBreast cancer is often classified into two types: non-invasive and invasive.\r\n\r\nNon-invasive breast cancer or in situ carcinoma carcinoma is located in the breasts of the breast. It can not be detected at the palpation of the breast, but in a mammogram.\r\n\r\nInvasive breast cancer extends beyond the breast. The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells of the ducts.\r\n\r\nOther types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's breast disease. Unfortunately, invasive breast cancer can spread to other areas of the body.\r\n\r\nAn exact cause of this type of cancer is unknown. Studies show that older age and female hormones play an important role in the development of this type of cancer. It is common in women over 50 years of age.\r\n\r\nRisk factors\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell why some women can develop breast cancer and others do not. There are risk factors which you can change, but some in front of whom you can not do anything.\r\n\r\nAge - 8 out of 10 women can have breast cancer after their 50th birthday.\r\nFamily history - if there are family-related cases, relatives of grade one and two, the risk of developing this type of cancer is very high.\r\nPrevious breast cancer or diagnosis - if you have previously had breast cancer or non-invasive cancer cell changes in the mammary ducts, or certain types of nodules may increase the risk of developing cancer.\r\nBreast density - Women who have more dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing this disease.\r\nFirst menstruation at an early age (less than 12 years old)\r\nRadiotherapy for breasts or chest\r\nEstrogen treatments\r\nOlder age at first childbirth\r\nOverweight and obesity\r\nDiet rich in fat\r\nThe most common symptom is the detection of a painless nodule at the breast or axle.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms include changes in breast shape and size, changes in the skin of the breasts (stains or creases), nipple leakage, nipple changes (either retracing or inversion), scarring in the nipple, etc.\r\n\r\nBreast self examination\r\n\r\nEach woman must be aware of the importance of breast self-examination, an important way to detect the disease at an early stage. Breast self examination should be part of the weekly routine. The more accurate you examine, the better you get to know your body and you will immediately find any changes in your breasts and axils.\r\nExamine for periods of your menstrual cycle, when the breasts are less painful and less touch-sensitive. If you feel a strong nodule or texture of a pile of sand, go to the doctor for a specialist consultation.\r\nAfter examining your breasts, your doctor may ask you to perform one or more tests and procedures as follows:\r\n\r\nMammography - At the age of 40, go annually or once every two years for this radiological breast exploration\r\nUltrasound - Women under 40 have breasts with higher density, so mammography is not relevant in establishing the diagnosis. An ultrasound will show any present node or anomaly.\r\nBiopsy - Harvesting a sample of breast tissue and testing it in the laboratory to see if it certifies the existence of cancer cells or not. A biopsy can also be performed on the lymph nodes in the axilla to see if they were affected or not. Also in the biopsy category: 1) needle aspiration - which can test a mammary cell sample to detect cancer, but also to drain a benign cyst; 2) puncture - a tissue sample is collected from the breast nodule; 3) Vacuum-assisted biopsy\r\nComputed Tomography (CT)\r\nOther common laboratory tests include blood counts and blood biochemical analyzes (such as transaminases), CA 15-3 and CEA tumor markers.",

We have included a lot of films and images to make things as convenient as possible for you.\r\n\r\nBreast cancer is a very common disease. Worldwide 1.7 million women were diagnosed in 2012. But the good news is: Breast cancer can be treated. The earlier a cancer disease is detected, the better it can be treated. \r\n\r\nBut how can you detect breast cancer early? Dear Mamma shows you how to do regular self checks. What should you look out for? How often is a self check recommended? \r\nThe app also tells you what you can do, if you notice anything peculiar. The most important thing is to keep calm. Most changes are not a sign for cancer. Still you shouldn’t hesitate to look for help, if you really need it. It is always a good first step to talk to people you trust when you are confronted with health issues. There should be no taboos and especially no shame when talking about your body and about breast cancer. If you or somebody close to you has to deal with breast cancer, you deserve respect and support.\r\n\r\nDear Mamma gives basic facts on cancer and its treatment. You will find reliable medical information, which is easy to understand. \r\n\r\nPlease notice: You need to be 18 years or older to use this app, as it contains content which is not appropriate for minors. The detailed medical information contains images that depict the body and the naked female breast. If you think these images could offend you, please be aware.",

But the good news is: Breast cancer can be treated. The earlier a cancer disease is detected, the better it can be treated. <br><br>But how can you detect breast cancer early? Dear Mamma shows you how to do regular self checks. What should you look out for? How often is a self check recommended? <br>The app also tells you what you can do, if you notice anything peculiar. The most important thing is to keep calm. Most changes are not a sign for cancer. Still you shouldn’t hesitate to look for help, if you really need it. It is always a good first step to talk to people you trust when you are confronted with health issues. There should be no taboos and especially no shame when talking about your body and about breast cancer. If you or somebody close to you has to deal with breast cancer, you deserve respect and support.<br><br>Dear Mamma gives basic facts on cancer and its treatment. You will find reliable medical information, which is easy to understand. <br><br>Please notice: You need to be 18 years or older to use this app, as it contains content which is not appropriate for minors. The detailed medical information contains images that depict the body and the naked female breast. If you think these images could offend you, please be aware.",

        "title": "Endometrial Cancer",
        "description": "Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period.bOther symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause. Approximately 40% of cases are related to obesity. Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive estrogen exposure, high blood pressure and diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk.

        "descriptionHTML": "Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period.bOther symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause. Approximately 40% of cases are related to obesity. Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive estrogen exposure, high blood pressure and diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk.

Antioxidants are also known as free radical scavengers.\r\n\r\nThe body makes some of the antioxidants it uses to neutralize free radicals. These antioxidants are called endogenous antioxidants. However, the body relies on external (exogenous) sources, primarily the diet, to obtain the rest of the antioxidants it needs. These exogenous antioxidants are commonly called dietary antioxidants. Fruits, vegetables, and grains are rich sources of dietary antioxidants. Some dietary antioxidants are also available as dietary supplements.\r\n\r\nExamples of dietary antioxidants include beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamins A, C, and E (alpha-tocopherol). The mineral element selenium is often thought to be a dietary antioxidant, but the antioxidant effects of selenium are most likely due to the antioxidant activity of proteins that have this element as an essential component (i.e., selenium-containing proteins), and not to selenium itself.\r\n\r\nIn laboratory and animal studies, the presence of increased levels of exogenous antioxidants has been shown to prevent the types of free radical damage that have been associated with cancer development. Therefore, researchers have investigated whether taking dietary antioxidant supplements can help lower the risk of developing or dying from cancer in humans.\r\n\r\nMany observational studies, including case control studies and cohort studies, have been conducted to investigate whether the use of dietary antioxidant supplements is associated with reduced risks of cancer in humans. Overall, these studies have yielded mixed results (5). Because observational studies cannot adequately control for biases that might influence study outcomes, the results of any individual observational study must be viewed with caution.  \r\n\r\nRandomized controlled clinical trials, however, lack most of the biases that limit the reliability of observational studies. Therefore, randomized trials are considered to provide the strongest and most reliable evidence of the benefit and/or harm of a health-related intervention.

Patients need the information stored in this app and if their connection to the app is gone there should be a way to retrieve it. There is no back up of information.",

I don't trust pop-ups like that so i immediately uninstalled it. It's a shame because it did look helpful and I hadn't been able to find anything else like it. I'm waiting to see if this pop-up occurs again anywhere else. If it turns out to be unrelated I will definitely try it again."

        "description": "Esophageal cancer is cancer arising from the esophagus—the food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (\"glands\") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood. The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut.[3][4] The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux.",

        "description": "You have many choices to make about your cancer treatment. One choice you might be thinking about is complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care. \r\n\r\nPeople use CAM therapies for a variety of reasons including:\r\n• To help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain, and fatigue\r\n• To comfort themselves and ease the worries of cancer treatment and related stress\r\n• To feel that they are doing something more to help with their own care\r\n• To try to treat or cure their cancer\r\n\r\nThese therapies aim to treat the body and the mind.\r\n \r\nIf you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your Cancer, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits.

Included in this tool are important links to learn more about quitting smoking, lung cancer screening, and to identify lung cancer screening programs that are accredited by the American College of Radiology (ACR).\r\n\r\nFOR PROVIDERS:\r\n\r\nThe rate of lung cancer screening among eligible patients in only 1.9% nationally. The Tamegagi scoring criteria used in this application is an accepted method of identifying patients for lung cancer screening and has been shown to be superior in sensitivity while maintaining specificity as compared with the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrollment criteria. Use this tool with patients to identify if your patient is eligible for lung cancer screening and to show them the impact smoking is having on their risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nWhat is lung cancer and why is lung cancer screening important?\r\n\r\nLung cancer is a cancer that develops in the parenchyma or airways of the lungs and is most commonly related to smoking, which is the biggest risk factor for this disease. Lung cancer is difficult to identify early due to a lack of specific symptoms, and therefore typically presents at an advanced stage where cure is more difficult and sometimes not possible. Recently, two major studies have been able to show an improvement in survival for patients that are at high risk of developing lung cancer and are screened with an annual low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, in 2015 the US Preventative Task Force (USPTF) endorsed a recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This rating was given a “B” grade which indicates with high certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening, which is the same grade given to mammography for breast cancer.\r\n\r\nSeveral groups, including Tammemagi et al and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), have suggested that today’s screening guidelines may be missing patients who are at risk due to other factors than smoking history and age, such as comorbidities like COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, family history of lung cancer, or certain higher risk minorities. In fact, Tammemagi scoring was found to have improved sensitivity of 83% over the 71% of USPSTF while maintaining specificity of approximately 63%. Therefore, it is clear that there are patients who would benefit from LDCT screening that are currently not being screened and that additional information may be necessary to be collected to further refine lung cancer screening.\r\n\r\nThis application aims to empower patients and providers to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening based on Tammemagi scoring criteria by dramatically simplifying the calculation and showing via a large evidence base the impact added smoking is having on the risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAssisted by Dr. Mark Waddle, Mayo Clinic\r\nMarkRWaddle@gmail.com\r\n\r\nGraphics by Kelly Chtcheprov",

Therefore, it is clear that there are patients who would benefit from LDCT screening that are currently not being screened and that additional information may be necessary to be collected to further refine lung cancer screening.<br><br>This application aims to empower patients and providers to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening based on Tammemagi scoring criteria by dramatically simplifying the calculation and showing via a large evidence base the impact added smoking is having on the risk of lung cancer.<br><br>Assisted by Dr. Mark Waddle, Mayo Clinic<br>MarkRWaddle@gmail.com<br><br>Graphics by Kelly Chtcheprov",

        "description": "Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread.",

You can also listen to the pronunciation.\r\n\r\nCancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.\r\n\r\nTobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% are due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy\r\n\r\nDictionary Features :\r\n\r\n• Bookmark Favorite Words\r\n• Completely offline and free\r\n• Night mode / Dark mode support\r\n• Change text size and fonts in settings\r\n• Thousands of Sociology Words and Terms\r\n• Alphabetical listing\r\n• Quick search option\r\n• Easy to use user interface\r\n• Text to speech option available\r\n• Share Words Definition to Social Media\r\n• Regular Updates\r\n• Word of the Day notification\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, all the terms are listed alphabetically with faster search facility, easy to navigate through entire app.\r\n\r\nThe screen is visually clear and offers a detailed but still understandable explanation.\r\n\r\nWrite us at elytelabs@outlook.com for suggestions and feedback for improvements.",

In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person&#39;s parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests.

        "description": "Soursop also known as \"Guyabano\" is a fruit that comes from the Graviola tree. Other names for soursop such as Pawpaw (in Brazil);Guanábana (Spanish), Africa and Southeast Asia; Graviola (Portuguese), Guyabano ( Philippines), and Custard Apple (English). The scientific name is Annona Muricata. The graviola tree grows in warm tropical areas such as the Philippines, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it has superfruit-healing properties as a high-antioxidant food due to its vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorous and even some iron that it contains. These vitamins and minerals are why soursop benefits include potentially helping reduce eye disease, treat infections and potentially even fight cancer, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown as a sedative, a nerve tonic, and used to maintain proper intestinal health, guyabano is just one medicinal tool stemming from the graviola tree. Throughout history, each part of the graviola tree, such as the bark, leaves, roots, fruit, and seeds have been used for medicinal purposes. The seeds have been used to treat nausea and vomiting, while herbal medicine practitioners recommend using the fruit and leaves to relieve stomach distress, pain, cough, asthma, and fever.\r\n\r\nA well-known fruit all over the world, the soursop's delicious white pulp, with tones of fruit candy and smooth cream is commonplace in tropical markets, but is rarely found fresh anywhere else. The graviola tree, or Annona  Muricata, produces the sweet soursop fruit, also called custard apple, paw paw or, in many Spanish speaking countries, guanabana. \r\n\r\nWhile the fruit is not as well known as others and is less researched, soursop health benefits are still worthy of note. soursop fruit is so delicious with a sharp aroma and a sweet-sour taste which is basically a combination of the taste of pineapple and strawberry. \r\n\r\nRecently, it has gained attention and popularity due to its natural cancer cell killing properties. There are also various uses of soursop apart from its anti- cancer properties. They have the Acetoginin containing compounds namely bulatacin, asimisin and squamosin. Acetoginin acts as an anti- feedent. Thus, they are often used in killing insects and pests which die by consuming these leaves even in small amounts. Scientific research conducted by The National Cancer Institute has proved that Soursop leaves can effectively attack and destroy cancer cells. In addition to this, they are also used in the treatment of several other diseases. \r\n\r\nThe App Features\r\n- About and origins of Soursop Superfruit.\r\n- Medical research on Soursop content to the human health.\r\n- The Top Benefits of Soursop including as an anti cancer superfruit.\r\n- Precautions and side effect of overdose soursop\r\n- and simple and easy to follow step by step recipes for soursop",

Absolute risk is the likelihood that a person will develop a specific type of cancer over a certain period of time, in this case 5 years.\r\n\r\nAlthough an individual's risk may be accurately estimated, these predictions cannot precisely determine who will develop melanoma. If you are not a health professional, you are strongly encouraged to discuss your results and personal risk of melanoma with your doctor.\r\n\r\nSkin type is the primary risk factor for developing melanoma. Fair-skinned races are at much greater risk than those with darker skins. This is because darker skinned people produce more melanin, the pigment that gives color to skin and hair, and protects the skin from damage from ultraviolet radiation.\r\n\r\nThe factors like indoor tanning, sunburns, skin type, UV exposure, genetic, atypical moles, red hair, organ transplant increase your skin cancer risk.",

General signs of throat cancer may include the following:\r\n\r\nSore throat: Pain or discomfort in your throat that doesn’t go away is one of the most common symptoms of throat cancer.\r\n\r\nVoice changes: Cancer in your throat can affect your voice. Your voice might sound different. It may be quieter, husky, or sound as if you have a cold all the time. You might slur some of your words or have trouble pronouncing certain sounds.\r\n\r\nTrouble swallowing: Throat cancer can cause pain or a burning sensation when chewing and swallowing food. You might feel like food is sticking in your throat.\r\n\r\nA lump in your neck: You may have a lump in your neck caused by an enlarged lymph node. Swelling in one or more lymph nodes in the neck is a common symptom of throat cancer, as well as other head and neck cancers. Lumps that come and go are not usually due to cancer. Cancer usually forms a lump that slowly gets bigger.\r\n\r\nWeight loss: Weight loss is a common symptom of many different types of cancer. Throat cancer can make it painful to eat and difficult to swallow, which can cause weight loss.\r\nOther Signs of Throat Cancer\r\ntrouble opening your mouth\r\ntrouble moving your tongue\r\nwhite patches on your tongue or the lining of your mouth that do not go away\r\ncoughing up blood\r\nnosebleeds\r\nheadaches\r\nTypes of Throat Cancer\r\nShare\r\nPrint\r\nThe type of throat cancer you have depends on the type of cell in which the cancer began. Pathologists are able to diagnose which type of cancer you have by looking at tumor cells under a microscope.\r\n\r\nMost throat cancers are squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cells are thin, flat cells that line the throat. Carcinoma means cancer.\r\n\r\nLymphoma and cancer of the minor salivary glands can also develop in the throat.

It extends from the back of the nose and mouth to the trachea (windpipe). Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or esophagus.\r\n\r\nThe pharynx has three main sections:\r\n\r\nThe nasopharynx is the upper part of the pharynx, where the throat connects the mouth and nose.\r\nThe oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx, including the tonsils, where the throat meets the oral cavity.\r\nThe hypopharynx is the bottom part of the pharynx, where the throat meets the windpipe.\r\nThroat Cancer Causes & Risk Factors\r\nTobacco: Tobacco use includes both smoking and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco). People who are exposed to secondhand smoke are also at a greater risk for throat cancer. If you smoke or chew tobacco, you can reduce your risk of throat cancer — and the risk to those around you — by stopping now. If you’ve been diagnosed with throat cancer or are in treatment, it’s not too late to quit. Learn more about Memorial Sloan Kettering’s tobacco treatment program.\r\nAlcohol: Alcohol consumption is another major risk factor for throat cancer.\r\nBetel quid and gutka: People who chew betel quid or gutka, which is more common in parts of Asia, have an increased risk of throat cancer.",
