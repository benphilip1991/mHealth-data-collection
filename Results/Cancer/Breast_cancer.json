Breast cancer can be categorised by whether it is non-invasive or invasive. Breast cancer is also categorised by how advanced the disease is into early, locally-advanced and metastatic. Breast cancer can be classified into subtypes based on hormonal and HER2 receptor status as follows: luminal A-like (ER and PgR positive, HER2 negative tumours), luminal B-like (ER and/or PgR positive, HER2 positive or negative tumours), HER2 overexpressing (ER and PgR negative, HER2 positive tumours) and basal-like (triple-negative tumours). It is important for determining the breast cancer treatment.\r\n\r\nThe app of Breast Cancer Survival Manual provides essential updates on treatment and care, enhancing the basic information that has made this the most trusted guide for women diagnosed with breast cancer for the past two decades. This  includes the most current advice on:\r\n· The new genomic classification of breast cancer and its importance in treatment planning\r\n· Cancer gene testing, which determines if a woman will benefit from chemotherapy\r\n· New developments in breast cancer treatments with new targeted agents\r\n· The continued importance of getting a second opinion: why it’s important, what questions to ask, and how to decide which team of doctors is best for you.\r\n\r\nConscious of the rapidly evolving spectrum of treatment options, the app Link outlines the latest findings and professional wisdom for patients in pursuit of the most effective treatment plan for them.

        "description": "Breast cancer is a disease in which cancerous (or malignant) cells develop uncontrollably in the breast tissue (usually in ducts - tubes that carry milk to the nipple - or in the lobules - the milk producing glands). It is the most common type of cancer seen in women and the leading cause of death.\r\nTypes of breast cancer\r\n\r\nBreast cancer is often classified into two types: non-invasive and invasive.\r\n\r\nNon-invasive breast cancer or in situ carcinoma carcinoma is located in the breasts of the breast. It can not be detected at the palpation of the breast, but in a mammogram.\r\n\r\nInvasive breast cancer extends beyond the breast. The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells of the ducts.\r\n\r\nOther types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's breast disease. Unfortunately, invasive breast cancer can spread to other areas of the body.\r\n\r\nAn exact cause of this type of cancer is unknown. Studies show that older age and female hormones play an important role in the development of this type of cancer. It is common in women over 50 years of age.\r\n\r\nRisk factors\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell why some women can develop breast cancer and others do not. There are risk factors which you can change, but some in front of whom you can not do anything.\r\n\r\nAge - 8 out of 10 women can have breast cancer after their 50th birthday.\r\nFamily history - if there are family-related cases, relatives of grade one and two, the risk of developing this type of cancer is very high.\r\nPrevious breast cancer or diagnosis - if you have previously had breast cancer or non-invasive cancer cell changes in the mammary ducts, or certain types of nodules may increase the risk of developing cancer.\r\nBreast density - Women who have more dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing this disease.\r\nFirst menstruation at an early age (less than 12 years old)\r\nRadiotherapy for breasts or chest\r\nEstrogen treatments\r\nOlder age at first childbirth\r\nOverweight and obesity\r\nDiet rich in fat\r\nThe most common symptom is the detection of a painless nodule at the breast or axle.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms include changes in breast shape and size, changes in the skin of the breasts (stains or creases), nipple leakage, nipple changes (either retracing or inversion), scarring in the nipple, etc.\r\n\r\nBreast self examination\r\n\r\nEach woman must be aware of the importance of breast self-examination, an important way to detect the disease at an early stage. Breast self examination should be part of the weekly routine. The more accurate you examine, the better you get to know your body and you will immediately find any changes in your breasts and axils.\r\nExamine for periods of your menstrual cycle, when the breasts are less painful and less touch-sensitive. If you feel a strong nodule or texture of a pile of sand, go to the doctor for a specialist consultation.\r\nAfter examining your breasts, your doctor may ask you to perform one or more tests and procedures as follows:\r\n\r\nMammography - At the age of 40, go annually or once every two years for this radiological breast exploration\r\nUltrasound - Women under 40 have breasts with higher density, so mammography is not relevant in establishing the diagnosis. An ultrasound will show any present node or anomaly.\r\nBiopsy - Harvesting a sample of breast tissue and testing it in the laboratory to see if it certifies the existence of cancer cells or not. A biopsy can also be performed on the lymph nodes in the axilla to see if they were affected or not. Also in the biopsy category: 1) needle aspiration - which can test a mammary cell sample to detect cancer, but also to drain a benign cyst; 2) puncture - a tissue sample is collected from the breast nodule; 3) Vacuum-assisted biopsy\r\nComputed Tomography (CT)\r\nOther common laboratory tests include blood counts and blood biochemical analyzes (such as transaminases), CA 15-3 and CEA tumor markers.",

With staggering statistics of over a million women being diagnosed each year, it is not hard to understand why there is this shadow of worry. \r\nProbably the most severe form of treatment and unfortunately the most common in years gone by is surgery. And any surgery can be stressful, but breast surgery that may indicate a need for follow-up breast cancer treatment can be extremely stressful for any woman. Hypnosis for breast cancer focuses specifically on this extreme stress. The calmer you are in any situation, the more resources your body and mind have to heal themselves as quickly as possible. Common sense, as well as research data, indicates that recovery from breast cancer is better if the patient receives emotional support during and after the treatment. \r\nThis app is specially designed to help you cope better with all the problems and issues that a woman undergone breast cancer treatment may have. The power of the subconscious mind can be a potent ally in healing from surgery and recovering from breast cancer, for it is the subconscious mind that controls automatic body processes, including immune function and pain perception. Additionally, the subconscious mind is the source of all emotions, which also makes hypnosis a logical choice for dealing with the emotional aspects of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. \r\n•If breast cancer treatment creates side effects, this app can help you minimize those side effects. \r\n•If breast cancer treatment has taken away your confidence and self-esteem, this app can help you regain it. \r\n•If breast cancer treatment creates body image issues, this app can also help you feel good about your body again. \r\n•If breast cancer treatment has made you forget that you are alive, beautiful, wanted and active, this app can help you remember it. \r\n•If breast cancer treatment has made you believe that all the good things in your life are over, this app will prove you wrong. \r\n•If breast cancer made you think that you are alone in this, this app will prove you wrong. \r\n\r\nVerbal instructions and therapeutically soothing music will gently guide you into a deeply relaxed state, uplifting your mind and spirit. Within moments, you will be eased into a state of mind that is calm and peaceful. This guarantees an opportunity to resolve any emotional problems you may have by creating for you a tranquil environment in which to reflect, or to drift smoothly into a revivifying sleep. Because trance is therapeutic by itself. Because the spirit is the foundation of the body, foundation of the way of life we live.",

        "description": "It serves to detect the appearance of any alteration in the shape or normal size of the breasts so that it can be treated early.\r\nOne of the greatest preventions for this disease that not only affects adult women, but currently affects more and more young women, is breast self-exploration. Dividing the breast into four parts, we observe that the most ducts are located in the upper external quadrant of the breast (close to the armpits). It is in this location where most of the malignant tumors of the breast take place (50%). The breast contains a variable number of lobules, between 10 and 20, and a few milk excretory ducts that flow into the nipple. These lobules are responsible for producing breast milk. With the self-exam you will learn to know the normal structure of your breasts and you will be able to discover any future anomaly that may appear. 95% of breast cancer cases can be cured, as long as they are detected in time.\r\n\r\nThe innovative factor of the glove is the increase in the sensitivity of the fingers that oscillates between 3 to 8 times, due to the combination of the material used for its production and the special oil between the two layers that form it. Its effectiveness has been tested in the Department of Biotechnology of the University of Alicante.\r\nThe study was performed with microspheres between 0.04 and 1.40 millimeters.\r\nBetween 93.2% (right hand) and 100% (left hand) of the cases the sensitivity of touch increased 3.3 times.\r\nBetween 53.3% (right hand) and 67% (left hand) of the cases the sensitivity of touch increased 6.6 times.\r\nBetween 20 % (right hand) and 14% (left hand) of the cases the sensitivity of touch increased 8.3 times.\r\nAnother conclusion that was obtained from the result was that the smaller the size of the particle, the greater the capacity of the Sensifemme glove to magnify the tactile sensitivity, which makes it very appropriate for the early detection of small lumps in the breasts.\r\nRisk factors: \r\nSex: It occurs mainly in women. It can also affect men although the probability is minimal.\r\nAge: 60% of breast cancers occur in women over 60 and the remaining 40% in younger women.\r\nGenes: There are 2 genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, that when mutated can cause the appearance of breast cancer.\r\nFamily history: When a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter) has had breast cancer, the risk of suffering from it is doubled. If it is a more distant relative (grandmother, aunt or cousin), the risk increases only slightly.\r\nMenstrual periods: The sooner menstruation begins (before the age of 12), the greater the risk of suffering from breast cancer, when compared to those that started later. Women with late menopause (after the age of 55) have a higher risk.\r\nLifestyle: Alcohol abuse, smoking, obesity, etc. increase the risk of breast cancer.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Sensifemme:\r\nIncreases touch sensitivity, allowing you to detect more quickly and more accurately any unknown formation, including lumps the size of a pinhead or a grain of sugar. In the case of breast cancer, its early diagnosis increases considerably the probability of cure.\r\nIt facilitates a more uniform palpation without resistance or friction that may affect the touch.\r\nIt magnifies the perception of the breast tissues.\r\nIt allows for a more effective and simple self-diagnosis, within the privacy of the home.\r\nIt detects more accurately changes in the skin or chest structure.\r\nIt is especially useful when touching with the fingers is painful.\r\n\r\nIf you have any doubt about how to carry out the technique, do not hesitate to consult your doctor, gynecologist and/or nurse.",

Volunteers do not provide medical advice. Reach To Recovery is a free program available to adults 18 and older who are living in the United States.\r\n\r\nReach To Recovery supports people wherever they are in their cancer journey. \r\n • Facing a possible diagnosis of breast cancer\r\n • Recently diagnosed with breast cancer\r\n • Considering or have had a lumpectomy or mastectomy\r\n • Considering breast reconstruction\r\n • Have arm swelling (lymphedema) from treatment\r\n • Undergoing or have completed treatment\r\n\r\nWho can join as a volunteer?\r\nReach To Recovery volunteers are breast cancer survivors who have been trained by the American Cancer Society to provide peer-to-peer support to those facing breast cancer. Volunteers must complete required training before joining the program. Volunteers provide support, but they do not provide medical advice.\r\n \r\nWhat information is required to join?\r\nPeers and volunteers provide their name, email address, and state of residence to create an account. In addition, peers complete a section called “Find a Reach To Recovery Volunteer” with the diagnosis and treatment information that is most important to them. Volunteers create a profile with their own diagnosis and treatment information.\r\n \r\nHow do peers find a volunteer?\r\nA peer’s preferences are compared to the volunteer profiles. For example, if a peer would like to chat with a volunteer who had a mastectomy, they can select that in their preferences. Peers can review the profiles of the volunteers who best match their preferences.   \r\n \r\nHow do peers connect with volunteers?\r\nAfter reviewing volunteer profiles, peers can send an online chat request to one or more volunteers. The volunteers can accept, decline, or propose a new time for the online chat. Volunteers typically respond within 24 hours, although it may occasionally take longer.\r\n \r\nWho can see my information?\r\nProgram participants in other roles can see your profile information. For example:\r\nIf you are a peer, volunteers will be able to see the information you provided in the “Find a Reach To Recovery Volunteer” and “Tell Us About Yourself” sections.\r\nIf you are a volunteer, peers will be able to see the information you provided in the “Your Diagnosis and Treatment Experience” and “Tell Us About Yourself” sections.\r\n\r\nWill other participants see my personal email address?\r\nYour contact information is not visible to other Reach To Recovery peers or volunteers. All scheduling and online chats are done on the Reach To Recovery website.  Although other participants will not send messages directly to your personal email, you will receive email notifications from the Reach To Recovery web site about new messages, chat requests, and reminders.",

Reach To Recovery is a free program available to adults 18 and older who are living in the United States.<br><br>Reach To Recovery supports people wherever they are in their cancer journey. <br> • Facing a possible diagnosis of breast cancer<br> • Recently diagnosed with breast cancer<br> • Considering or have had a lumpectomy or mastectomy<br> • Considering breast reconstruction<br> • Have arm swelling (lymphedema) from treatment<br> • Undergoing or have completed treatment<br><br>Who can join as a volunteer?<br>Reach To Recovery volunteers are breast cancer survivors who have been trained by the American Cancer Society to provide peer-to-peer support to those facing breast cancer. Volunteers must complete required training before joining the program. Volunteers provide support, but they do not provide medical advice.<br> <br>What information is required to join?<br>Peers and volunteers provide their name, email address, and state of residence to create an account. In addition, peers complete a section called “Find a Reach To Recovery Volunteer” with the diagnosis and treatment information that is most important to them. Volunteers create a profile with their own diagnosis and treatment information.<br> <br>How do peers find a volunteer?<br>A peer’s preferences are compared to the volunteer profiles. For example, if a peer would like to chat with a volunteer who had a mastectomy, they can select that in their preferences. Peers can review the profiles of the volunteers who best match their preferences.   <br> <br>How do peers connect with volunteers?<br>After reviewing volunteer profiles, peers can send an online chat request to one or more volunteers. The volunteers can accept, decline, or propose a new time for the online chat. Volunteers typically respond within 24 hours, although it may occasionally take longer.<br> <br>Who can see my information?<br>Program participants in other roles can see your profile information. For example:<br>If you are a peer, volunteers will be able to see the information you provided in the “Find a Reach To Recovery Volunteer” and “Tell Us About Yourself” sections.<br>If you are a volunteer, peers will be able to see the information you provided in the “Your Diagnosis and Treatment Experience” and “Tell Us About Yourself” sections.<br><br>Will other participants see my personal email address?<br>Your contact information is not visible to other Reach To Recovery peers or volunteers. All scheduling and online chats are done on the Reach To Recovery website.  Although other participants will not send messages directly to your personal email, you will receive email notifications from the Reach To Recovery web site about new messages, chat requests, and reminders.",

An app is something that stays on your phone so i think you shldve made it a website. I am just shocked kudu ventures decided to invest like 2 million birr on this 😂like whats the bussiness plan here??",

The emphasis is very much on a “how to do” approach, with detailed guidance and advice on the various techniques. The informative text is supported by a wealth of color illustrations, and accompanying videos of procedures are available via the publisher’s website.

This is an extremely helpful app for any surgeon who is studying and/or performing reconstructive breast surgery.

Oncoplastic and reconstructive surgery combines the most up-to-date techniques in plastic surgery with surgery for breast cancer, providing optimal oncologic and aesthetic results by means of a single procedure.

Breast cancer is the top cancer in women worldwide and is increasing particularly in developing countries where the majority of cases are diagnosed in late stages. Breast cancer survival rates vary greatly worldwide, The low survival rates in less developed countries can be explained mainly by the lack of \r\nearly detection programmes, resulting in a high proportion of women presenting with late-stage disease.Early diagnosis of cancer generally increases the chances for successful treatment by focusing on detecting symptomatic patients as early as possible.The consequences of delayed or inaccessible cancer care are lower likelihood of survival, greater morbidity of treatment and higher costs of care, resulting in avoidable deaths and disability from cancer.Early diagnosis improves cancer outcomes by providing care at the earliest possible stage and is therefore an important public health strategy in all settings.",

Breast cancer survival rates vary greatly worldwide, The low survival rates in less developed countries can be explained mainly by the lack of <br>early detection programmes, resulting in a high proportion of women presenting with late-stage disease.Early diagnosis of cancer generally increases the chances for successful treatment by focusing on detecting symptomatic patients as early as possible.The consequences of delayed or inaccessible cancer care are lower likelihood of survival, greater morbidity of treatment and higher costs of care, resulting in avoidable deaths and disability from cancer.Early diagnosis improves cancer outcomes by providing care at the earliest possible stage and is therefore an important public health strategy in all settings.",

        "description": "On estime qu’un homme sur deux et une femme sur trois seront touchés par un cancer au cours de leur vie. Chez l’homme, les cancers les plus fréquents sont : le cancer de la prostate, du poumon et du côlon ; chez la femme, ce sont : le cancer du sein, du côlon et celui du poumon. \r\n\r\nBien manger réduit non seulement le risque de développer un cancer mais l'adjonction d'aliments dits \"anti cancer\" fournit une aide extraordinaire aux cellules de notre corps pour combattre les inflammations et le développement de cellules cancéreuses.\r\n\r\nLe cancer peut toucher tous les organes. Il est dû à la multiplication non contrôlée et la mutation de cellules du corps qui finissent par former une tumeur. \r\n\r\nLe plus souvent la cause est inconnue. Mais certains cancers ont des causes précises : une forte exposition au soleil pour le mélanome, à l’amiante pour le cancer de la plèvre, le tabagisme pour le cancer du poumon… \r\n\r\nNon détruites, ces cellules cancéreuses peuvent envahir d’autres organes.

        "descriptionHTML": "On estime qu’un homme sur deux et une femme sur trois seront touchés par un cancer au cours de leur vie.

        "description": "For a woman, having firm and fuller boobs is a physical asset. This kind of physical attribute is favored to be kept well-maintained. Even the world of beauty and fashion has considered a woman having fuller boob as an asset in these fields. However, the boob being a physical feature can not be kept looking good all the time. Through time and physical activities, the once full and firm boob could become saggy and droopy.\r\n\r\nThis condition of the boob being saggy is described as when the nipple droops below the crease of the boob. There are women who would consider undergoing surgical procedures in order to achieve improvements in the boobs through boob implants or boob augmentation. This procedure makes the boobs bigger but will not lift up the nipples or the boob area.\r\n\r\nIn order for the boob to be lifted up to make it appear firm and full, the procedure that needs to be considered performed on saggy boobs is the boob lift. The procedure concentrates on the tightening the loose skin that caused the boob to droop. However the size of the boob will not be made bigger. For those women considering to enlarging their boobs, the procedure that is right for this problem is boob augmentation or breast implants. Certain fillers are added in the breast parts to create fuller and denser breasts.\r\n\r\nThese procedures are done independently or one at a time. But there are those that want to consider undergoing various procedures. They want to lift up the breasts so a breast lift is done. At the same time, they want to add to the size of the breasts so together with the breast lift, the breast augmentation is also performed.\r\n\r\nFor the woman to determine what surgical procedure to consider for breast problems, it is recommended that certain evaluations be made. If the sagging of the breast falls in the Grade I ptosis stage which is mild, it is best that a breast lift be avoided and just be contended with how the actual breast appearance with no show of any scars from the procedure. If the level of sagging is in Grade II which is in the mild stage, it is best to have the breast lift procedure done simultaneous with the breast augmentation to get the best results.\r\n\r\nHome remedies mentioned earlier are the safer methods to be considered to improve breast sagging. Since the procedure uses all-natural ingredients, there is less complications experienced such as side effects. The faster procedure to improve breast sagging is undergoing surgical procedures such as breast lifts and breast implants. However, there are risks involved in these procedures and unwanted side effects may be experienced.\r\n\r\nTo improve a breast imperfection such as breast sagging can be dealt well by the woman with the right attitude. There are various remedies that are recommended from herbal all-natural home remedies to surgical procedures. The choices however the improvement is done is the woman's prerogative.

        "description": "What should you do to promote breast milk production? Many women experience the dilemma of low breast milk supply. It is not uncommon. This may be due to a variety of factors. Some of the factors may include: poor nutrition, increased stress, the baby's inability to latch properly onto the nipple or his inability to suck hard enough. Sucking, like pumping, stimulates breast milk production. The comfort level of the new mother to motherhood may also be a contributing factor.\r\n\r\nWomen are able to increase milk supply. One method that can be employed is to increase the daily feedings for the baby. Switching your breast during feeding periods should also be conducted. This promotes more stimulation in the back of the breasts allowing the milk to travel to the nipples. Medicinal remedies such as galactagogues can also be administered. These are available in the form of teas or herbal extracts. However, some herbs such as parsley and sage should be completely avoided by lactating women as they are thought to decrease breast milk supply.\r\n\r\nA well balanced diet is imperative. Adequate amounts of calories and good nutrition should be maintained as part of the lactating period of the mother as it promotes milk production. Fresh water and herbals teas should also be incorporated on a regular basis. Motherhood may be uncomfortable for some women and feelings of pleasure or pain may accompany nursing. Finding a quiet place to nurse and bond with your baby can make it less stressful and increase breast milk supply.\r\n\r\nStress may also be a cause of diminished supply in breast milk. Nursing requires a large amount of energy and can lead to postpartum depression in some women. Stress relievers that may work for you should be sought and also talking with someone may help alleviate anxiety experienced.\r\n\r\nBreast milk production can be unknowingly affected by the mother due to the intake of some foods containing anti-galactogogues. Some foods that contain these anti-milk making agents are herbs, decongestants, cabbage, peppermint, sage, etc.\r\n\r\nTo promote breast milk production:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure adequate sleep, relaxation and rest\r\n2. Drink plenty water and/or fluids in general\r\n3. Feed the baby to provide breast stimulation and hence production\r\n4. Add breasting pumping to your routine which also helps in stimulation\r\n\r\nNaturally occurring galactogogues can also be added to the mother's diet. These naturally occurring galactogogues may be found in foods such as apricots, carrots, green beans, sweet potatoes, pecans, oatmeal, green leafy vegetables, etc. These are healthy foods that can improve nutrition for anyone but especially for breast feeding mothers to increase milk production.",

        "description": "Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period.bOther symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause. Approximately 40% of cases are related to obesity. Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive estrogen exposure, high blood pressure and diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk. Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents. Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as \"uterine cancer\", although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as cervical cancer, uterine sarcoma, and trophoblastic disease. The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for more than 80% of cases. Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by endometrial biopsy or by taking samples during a procedure known as dilation and curettage. A pap smear is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer. Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for.",

It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body.

        "description": "How to Make Your Breasts Perkier\r\nFor many women, having perky breasts is a priority. Still, with age, pregnancy, and weight fluctuations, breasts can appear less firm and perky. Every woman's body is unique and especially larger breasts might not seem perky. That's okay. If, however, you want to try for firmer breasts, you can do different exercises to strengthen your pectoralis muscles. This is not guaranteed to make your breasts perkier, but it will give you a more toned chest, and that may support the breast tissue better. Incorporating some lifestyle changes can also help.\r\n\r\nHow to Firm Your Breasts\r\nIt is not uncommon to want to have firm and perky breasts. Unfortunately, pregnancy, hormone fluctuations, and aging of the breast tissue and skin can easily cause your breasts to sag. While you can quickly achieve dramatic results by consulting a medical professional and possibly having surgery, this is not the only route to getting firmer breasts. Adjusting your lifestyle and posture habits will prevent any further sagging from occurring, and developing a normal exercise routine that targets the chest muscles will lift your breasts over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA women’s breasts are very important to her and, of course, it is important for her to feel comfortable and confident with them.

Before we analyze some of the solutions for breast sagging, it is important to understand the causes, so you can specifically direct your preventive techniques or treatments.\r\n\r\nEvery woman desires to have firm breasts especially after childbirth or breastfeeding, but this is not always the case. Although breastfeeding tends to take all the blame for saggy breasts, it is not the lone cause of drooping breasts.\r\n\r\nSagging is actually the result of pregnancy and other influences.\r\n\r\nThey include genetics, age, smoking, size/shape of your pre-pregnancy breast, number of children you have as well as your age. Don’t let saggy breasts weigh you down.\r\n\r\nSagging breasts can actually take a toll on your figure.

        "description": "Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells anywhere in a body. These abnormal cells are termed cancer cells, malignant cells, or tumor cells. These cells can infiltrate normal body tissues. Many cancers and the abnormal cells that compose the cancer tissue are further identified by the name of the tissue that the abnormal cells originated from (for example, breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer).\r\n\r\n Cancer is not confined to humans; animals and other living organisms can get cancer. Below is a schematic that shows normal cell division and how when a cell is damaged or altered without repair to its system, the cell usually dies. Also shown is what occurs when such damaged or unrepaired cells do not die and become cancer cells and show uncontrolled division and growth -- a mass of cancer cells develop.\r\n\r\n Frequently, cancer cells can break away from this original mass of cells, travel through the blood and lymph systems, and lodge in other organs where they can again repeat the uncontrolled growth cycle. This process of cancer cells leaving an area and growing in another body area is termed metastatic spread or metastasis. For example, if breast cancer cells spread to a bone, it means that the individual has metastatic breast cancer to bone. This is not the same as \"bone cancer,\" which would mean the cancer had started in the bone.\r\n\r\nPlease do consider leaving a positive review and rating the App 5 star Thank you",

KASHF also works towards providing information and guidance to facilitate the early detection of many types of cancer, i.e. breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate, melanoma, and colon cancer. KASHF's first project is flagged through the Pink Caravan initiative which was especially designed to raise awareness around breast cancer and to encourage both women and men, residing within the United Arab Emirates, to perform self-examinations and go for regular meChdical check-ups.\r\n\r\nThe initiative was launched under the patronage of HRH Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah and under the directives of HH Sheikha Jawaher Bint Mohammed Al-Qasimi, Wife of the Ruler of Sharjah, Founder and Royal Patron of the Friends of Cancer Patients charitable society (FoCP), Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) International Ambassador for Childhood Cancer, and UICC International Ambassador of the World Cancer Declaration.\r\n\r\nThe Pink Caravan aims to raise awareness around breast cancer early detection and screening methods, lobby for the creation of the first UAE National Cancer Registry, and raise sufficient funds to purchase and operate a state of the art mobile mammography unit. The Pink Caravan ride takes place annually, focusing across all seven emirates of the UAE, including remote and outlying areas. Over 150 experienced equine riders join forces each year, garnering support across different sectors, bringing together schools, universities, corporations, Pink Caravan ambassadors and royalty. The funds raised during this awareness campaign will ensure the availability of the latest technology and highest quality in the early screening and detection of breast cancer, making services accessible to every woman and man in the UAE.\r\n\r\nA novel and unique initiative, the Pink Caravan has garnered widespread recognition locally, regionally, and internationally. To date the Pink Caravan Ride has travelled over 900 km across the seven emirates, with over 250 riders and 200 volunteers helping to ensure its success. Lectures and presentations were delivered at more than 100 schools and more than 250 mobile medical clinics offering early breast cancer detection examinations have been set up with more than 22,877 people, including over 5,450 men, being screened.

        "description": "There are conditions that happen to some physical features that can be repaired when imperfections are seen. The causes may at times be accidental and sometimes are inevitable. These imperfections tend to lower the self-esteem of a person most especially of women. At these times when there is consciousness of how one appears physically, women are driven to always look their best to be recognized and to be admired. Physical features that are considered important to upkeep are the breasts. These are the external assets of a woman that projects confidence for her.\r\n\r\nHowever, physical features undergo changes through time. Some may show positive growth or change but there are those features that tend to depreciate because of certain causes. The breasts of a woman undergo this particular change. For older women in their 50's, the breasts may start to lose firmness and fullness because of the sagging of the skin around the area. Women who have gone through numerous pregnancies and childbirth will experience the sagging of their breasts. Studies also have show that women smokers will have tendencies of breast sagging.\r\n\r\nThe condition of sagging breasts may be remedied or improved depending on how this imperfection is handled. The favored remedy to restore the sagging breast to become fuller and firmer is through a surgical procedure called mastopexy or breast lift. Other women would opt for breast implants to get back the volume on the breast. These are two independent procedures but there are women who would want to get both procedures all at once.\r\n\r\nThere are even confusing beliefs regarding one cause of breast sagging. Others believe that excessive sports like jogging and some outdoor sports may cause the breasts to sag because of the constant heavy movements of the body forcing the breasts to move as well. The pressure that is placed on the breasts to bounce while performing the activities causes the breasts to droop. What is the believable thing to do at this point is for women engaging in such strenuous activities to wear a sports brassiere to act as support for the breasts. This type of brassiere was made in such a way that they are able to hold the breasts.\r\n\r\nThere is still no perfect brassiere that could be considered the best to use during exercises. There are constant experiments and designs made to try to get the best brassiere for support for the breasts. With the current brassieres already for use in the market, it still could not perfectly stop the breasts from movements to refrain it from having pains and stretching of the tissues in the breasts. Still, there is the tendency for breast sagging to happen because of the movements experienced.\r\n\r\nHopefully, experts may come up in the future of the right brassiere to cater to active sporty women so that their breasts will be completely protected from the heavy movements of their sport so as to prevent the sagging of breasts. This will be ease women of the discomfort and pain that they may experience while doing the exercises. At the moment, women should just take extra care to protecting their breasts and just be observant of how they feel. There are also other means to handle the stress felt by the breasts like using some oils and creams and apply a gentle massage on the breast and the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nAre you SICK and TIRED with your sagging breast and jealous with friends who have better breast and nicer cleavage than yours?

Included in this tool are important links to learn more about quitting smoking, lung cancer screening, and to identify lung cancer screening programs that are accredited by the American College of Radiology (ACR).\r\n\r\nFOR PROVIDERS:\r\n\r\nThe rate of lung cancer screening among eligible patients in only 1.9% nationally. The Tamegagi scoring criteria used in this application is an accepted method of identifying patients for lung cancer screening and has been shown to be superior in sensitivity while maintaining specificity as compared with the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrollment criteria. Use this tool with patients to identify if your patient is eligible for lung cancer screening and to show them the impact smoking is having on their risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nWhat is lung cancer and why is lung cancer screening important?\r\n\r\nLung cancer is a cancer that develops in the parenchyma or airways of the lungs and is most commonly related to smoking, which is the biggest risk factor for this disease. Lung cancer is difficult to identify early due to a lack of specific symptoms, and therefore typically presents at an advanced stage where cure is more difficult and sometimes not possible. Recently, two major studies have been able to show an improvement in survival for patients that are at high risk of developing lung cancer and are screened with an annual low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, in 2015 the US Preventative Task Force (USPTF) endorsed a recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This rating was given a “B” grade which indicates with high certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening, which is the same grade given to mammography for breast cancer.\r\n\r\nSeveral groups, including Tammemagi et al and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), have suggested that today’s screening guidelines may be missing patients who are at risk due to other factors than smoking history and age, such as comorbidities like COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, family history of lung cancer, or certain higher risk minorities. In fact, Tammemagi scoring was found to have improved sensitivity of 83% over the 71% of USPSTF while maintaining specificity of approximately 63%. Therefore, it is clear that there are patients who would benefit from LDCT screening that are currently not being screened and that additional information may be necessary to be collected to further refine lung cancer screening.\r\n\r\nThis application aims to empower patients and providers to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening based on Tammemagi scoring criteria by dramatically simplifying the calculation and showing via a large evidence base the impact added smoking is having on the risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAssisted by Dr. Mark Waddle, Mayo Clinic\r\nMarkRWaddle@gmail.com\r\n\r\nGraphics by Kelly Chtcheprov",

We are constantly working on making the content and functionality of our beauty app better for you!",

            "The app works great! Your send you picture in, click what you want done to it, it sends in to a professional who fixes it up in no time and sends it back. You do have to pay tokens to get it sent it and the amount of tokens depends on the amount of things you want done to the picture.",
            "Overall, very very good app! I am a frequent user, new to photography, not a lot of clients yet. So, when clients choose 100 - 300 credits in edits total, it adds up quick. I have the $24 sub and 1000 credits a month, any higher subscription and I cut close to profits. I find myself buying many additional credits monthly. It would be great if it was $24 a month/1000 credits a WEEK, it seems do-able and better for all customers. Devs please respond, is this a possibility for the future? thanks!",
            "5 stars because they are really good artists and super fast but i do have issues with the functionality of the app. There isn't a way to explain things till its been done so you have to pay again if you don't like what they do. Perhaps thats best since it would probably lead to people asking for too much, but also had an issue with having to pay .99cents twice for the same thing. First retouch is free but it costs .99 to take off logo .",
            "This app has gone down the hill in the past few months. If you ask for something specific most likely the designer won't do it, and when you ask them to retouch it, they'll send the exact same image. Total waste of money honestly. I also contacted them and they responded by saying that the image was changed in accordance to my request, when it was not whatsoever. Don't expect to get a fefund for anything. 1 star.",
            "I used it to alter the look of a dnd (fictional/fantasy) character to be more thick and muscular like a barbarian. It cost a couple dollars but do worth of for and quick and easy because they do it for you. Not flawless editing or anything but much better than I could have done on my own"

        "description": "This conscious visualisation with virtual reality for people suffering from breast cancer is an exercise in managing emotions based on the use of the imagination, which activates certain areas of the brain and our mind. Well-trained visualisations are an essential tool when it comes to transforming our emotions, words and actions. \r\n\r\nBy visualising, we activate the same areas of the brain as if the action had already taken place. When the visualisations are done consciously, we become 100% responsible for our own lives. \r\n \r\nMain Characteristics: \r\n\r\nThis is a method for personal development, with simple tools that serve to improve people’s well-being through awareness. It helps those who use it to improve their current life.\r\n\r\nIt impacts the essence of the problem, reaching an unprecedented depth that is difficult to surpass. \r\n\r\nIt’s easy, because all you need to do is see and listen to the visualisation, and get in tune with your being. \r\n\r\nThis is an easy-to-do and powerful habit, because the more you practice it, the more you see and the more you listen, the more well-being you will feel. “When we are consistent and practice Bioconsciencia® every day, our cells, our organs and our entire body achieve their fullest expression for the rest of our life.”  \r\n\r\nEmotions are activated to achieve a healthier life. We go to great lengths to make sure that there is always an atmosphere of well-being in order for people to have fun while they are engaged in improving their quality of life, learning to manage their emotions, their time and their work life. \r\n\r\nThe app is made to work with cardboard virtual reality glasses and the like, but it also provides the option of practicing conscious visualisations without the need for virtual reality glasses.\r\n\r\nAbout Bioconsciousness \r\n\r\nBioconsciousness is a project that handles the different tools to achieve human development. Some of which are: visualization, the use of human voice as a transformational element, and conscious personal training. Bioconsciousness tries to produce a change in interior attitude that allows us to better deal with difficulties of life and be happier.\r\nOur system to strengthen health is supported by academic studies on neuroscience of several American and European universities.\r\nIt is being successfully used to improve the relationships in educational institutions and health centres reducing stress of   its teams members. It also improves human relationships in companies .In general, allows anyone to develop their abilities to harmonize their life using love inside their hearts.",

Breast milk is loaded with antibodies and nutrients that are essential for the immune system, and for proper growth and development. \r\n\r\nMore topics will discuss:\r\n\r\n- Increasing Low Milk Supply\r\n- Foods to increase breast milk production\r\n- How to Increase Breast Milk Naturally\r\n- Best Foods To Increase Breast Milk\r\n- Much More\r\n\r\nFeatures of the app:\r\n\r\nCan Use For Offline App\r\nUpdated regularly\r\nYou can ask questions to us for more idea about content.\r\nSimple app book Knowledge like pocket on your phone\r\nYou can also send us your suggestions and we will add them inside the app For more updates.\r\n\r\nRead here about how to increase breast milk:\r\n\r\nThe mother will also find advantages to breastfeeding, such as quicker weight loss, reduced risk of cancer, and quicker shrinking of the uterus back to its normal size. Here are some tips on ensuring that you have a proper amount of breast milk.\r\n\r\nFeed Often\r\n\r\nThe more often you breastfeed your baby, the more your milk will come in. When your baby suckles on your breasts, it stimulates the production of breast milk. Your body has an amazing way of knowing when it needs to produce breast milk. If your breasts are being nursed often, your body will respond to that accordingly by supplying more milk. Most likely, your newborn will want to feed often anyway in the first few weeks.\r\n\r\nNurse Both Breasts at Each Feeding\r\n\r\nNursing both breasts at each feeding will ensure that you do not end up lopsided. In addition, it will induce milk flow to each breast more evenly. Let your baby feed off your breast until the milk seems to have run out - this will ensure that the baby receives the nutrient-rich hindmilk. Then switch breasts and do the same.\r\n\r\nKeep Well-Hydrated\r\n\r\nYou will find it difficult to produce enough milk if you don't drink enough water. Having enough fluids in your body will help keep the breast milk flowing. Ideally you should drink between 8 to 10 glasses of water per day, but juices and milk should also help.\r\n\r\nMassage Your Breasts\r\n\r\nMassaging your breasts can stimulate the production of breast milk. The action of breastfeeding itself is a great massage on the breasts, which gets the milk flowing. In between feedings, knead your breasts in a similar fashion to breastfeeding itself - preferably in the shower or bath when warm water is on your breasts. This massage will stimulate your body to increase the flow of breast milk.\r\n\r\nPrescription Medication\r\n\r\nIf you've tried everything, and still feel that you are not producing enough breast milk, there are prescription drugs that your doctor can prescribe for you that will stimulate the production of breast milk. One drug in particular that is generally prescribed for this reason is Domperidone. Ask your doctor about it if you feel you need extra help in the breastfeeding department.\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding is a wonderful opportunity for a new mother to provide amazing nutrients to her new baby, and to bond with the newborn. In order to get the milk flowing, there are numerous things you can do to increase its production.\r\n\r\nDownload how to increase breast milk app for get more tips for mom.",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

        "comments": [
            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."
