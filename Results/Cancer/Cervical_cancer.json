        "description": "Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread.",

The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period.bOther symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause. Approximately 40% of cases are related to obesity. Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive estrogen exposure, high blood pressure and diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk. Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents. Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as \"uterine cancer\", although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as cervical cancer, uterine sarcoma, and trophoblastic disease. The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for more than 80% of cases. Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by endometrial biopsy or by taking samples during a procedure known as dilation and curettage. A pap smear is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer. Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for.",

They are a rad bit slower to responding to messages since covid occurred but not by much. I've gotten all of my questions answered since I only started pills last year for the first time. Love it! ♡",
            "Convenient, affordable, accessible. Takes them days-weeks to respond to messages. Another week or so to to put the order through, no option for expedited shipping. But then your card gets declined (bank issues, low income, etc.) they lock the prescription until you change cards/message them to re-up the RX. Birth control is something you have to take regularly and it's ridiculous for them to make it so hard and time consuming EVERY time I try to order. Planned Parenthood is still best.",
            "I used to love this app for bc. I needed an emergency contraceptive and decided to get it through this app. It said $20. I checked out and my total was $35 because of the \"consultation fee\" which is dumb cause it's just plan b but hey I'll pay $35 instead of $50 if I got it directly from the store. I picked it up for it to be the regular $50 plus a stupid $15 consultation fee! Ridiculous! Very misleading.",
            "I used them for a couple of years. I have had to change my password three times over the course of three months. Could not get access to my own account due to an error saying that i did not have permission to access this account (after i already changed my password so i knew that was not the issue). I tried reaching out several times and was told to change my password and nobody has reached out to help me since. I have since changed who i get my birth control from."

        "description": "The m-Shakti App:\r\nThe Indian Cancer Society brings to you a revolution in women’s healthcare — the m-Shakti app. Useful for women everywhere, the app is an easy-to-understand, at-home guide that demystifies breast and cervical cancer — illnesses that plague women of reproductive age commonly, but are seldom understood well. \r\n\r\nDesigned with the aim to simplify and educate, m-Shakti incorporates intuitive and interactive design, simple explanations and comes with an optional voiceover. Currently, it is available in Hindi, with an English version in the offing. m-Shakti is named after its eponymous mascot, Shakti didi, who was created to humanise the app experience.

Currently, it is available in Hindi, with an English version in the offing. m-Shakti is named after its eponymous mascot, Shakti didi, who was created to humanise the app experience.

Warts are the most easily recognized symptom of genital HPV infection. About 90% of those who contract HPV will not develop genital warts. HPV types 6 and 11 are most frequently the cause of genital warts. It is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, usually during oral, genital, or anal sex with an infected partner. While some types of HPV cause cervical cancer and anal cancers, these are not the same types of HPV that cause genital warts. Some HPV vaccines includes coverage for types 6 and 11 and therefore can prevent genital warts. It is also possible to be infected with different types of HPV either at the same or different times. Although estimates of the number of new cases a year vary, HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active people will get it at some point in their lives. A condyloma acuminatum is a single genital wart, and condylomata acuminata are multiple genital warts. The word roots mean \"pointed wart\" (from Greek κόνδυλος, \"knuckle\", Greek -ωμα -oma, \"disease,\" and Latin acuminatum \"pointed\").

        "description": "Genital warts are symptoms of a contagious sexually transmitted disease caused by some types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts are the most easily recognized symptom of genital HPV infection. About 90% of those who contract HPV will not develop genital warts. HPV types 6 and 11 are most frequently the cause of genital warts. It is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, usually during oral, genital, or anal sex with an infected partner. While some types of HPV cause cervical cancer and anal cancers, these are not the same types of HPV that cause genital warts. Some HPV vaccines includes coverage for types 6 and 11 and therefore can prevent genital warts. It is also possible to be infected with different types of HPV either at the same or different times. Although estimates of the number of new cases a year vary, HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active people will get it at some point in their lives. A condyloma acuminatum is a single genital wart, and condylomata acuminata are multiple genital warts. The word roots mean \"pointed wart\" (from Greek κόνδυλος, \"knuckle\", Greek -ωμα -oma, \"disease,\" and Latin acuminatum \"pointed\"). Although similarly named, it is not the same as condyloma latum, which is a complication of secondary syphilis.",

            "The extra filters keep disappearing after a couple of weeks or so. I am fed up with constantly having to reinstall them. Am uninstalling. Haven't the time or patience. A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles.The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Repeated infections of the eyes that go without treatment can result in trachoma, a common cause of blindness in the developing world. Chlamydia can be spread during vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth. The eye infections may also be spread by personal contact, flies, and contaminated towels in areas with poor sanitation. Chlamydia trachomatis only occurs in humans. Diagnosis is often by screening which is recommended yearly in sexually active women under the age of twenty five, others at higher risk, and at the first prenatal visit. Testing can be done on the urine or a swab of the cervix, vagina, or urethra.  Rectal or mouth swabs are required to diagnose infections in those areas.",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",

I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",

The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",

            "I like this game but I don't understand why you have to watch adds to get some clothes. It's so annoying but other than that it's a great game. I like the way you don't get the same clothes for every girl. It's fun because you can use your imagination but I really wish you could move the people around. It's ok for kids but at the start they're all in bra's!! It's cool that you can start with any girl though. So it has a good side and a bad side",
            "Hooray, this update brings a much needed feature - saving your progress. Thanks, devs! This game is enjoyable. So many possible combinations, I've played for months, and still haven't created the same girl twice. Lots of categories - skirts, pants, shorts, long shirts, short shirts, jackets, scarves, jewellery, make-up, hair and more. Plus 4 skin tones for a realistic group of girls. The best dress-up game I've downloaded, definitely worth installing!",
            "This is good enough but my opinion is that you just change the yellow girl cuz she's not my favorite but thank you and she does not have good outfits you need to make more outfits for them and please don't make them extra fancy they all go she's my favorite but she needs more good clothes",
            "Game was okay but I did have a problem with a dressing it up so I could get there while you could only dress it up and you couldn't do anything with it so that's why I gave it to just start reading but I wouldn't really recommend you couldn't get it cuz it's kind of boring.",
            "This game is excellent, fabulous, fantastic, amazing, and interesting. I love this game. I suggest you to also try rhis game to those who will see my comment and I am sure you will also love it"

            "Loved the game from I started to play it. It has taught me patience, respect for others, base designing, to reach your goal which is Masters League im at 3045 trying to get to 3200. This game has just been a big impact in my life. I absolutely love the hero skins. In my opinion Clockwise Queen, P.E.K.K.A King and the Pirate Warden. Now let me talk about what I think you need to improve on is the Builder Base I honestly think that you guys need to look at that side more. In my opinion the walls are way to expensive it takes to long for me to upgrade them. Now lets talk about the normal side now. I think you need to work on people getting attacked and losing a lot of trophies I used to lose 20 to 35 trophies back when I was a TH9 and I couldnt reach Masters League so I decided to upgrade mt TH and I loe 10 to 20 trophies now because I found an anti 1 star. But besides that I love the fact that this game is so old and its not dying and hopefully will not. But thats it for me. GOOD LUCK!!!",
            "One of the greatest games of all time. Clash of Clans was a childhood favorite of mine. Combining amazing gameplay with the ease of playing in your phone, anywhere and anytime, Clash of Clans is the lovechild of some of the best classic CRPG and RTS games. Clash of Clans has an addictive nature, and the game runs flawlessly on almost any device. Battles are exciting and intense, base building is very fun and limitless. You can play the game any way you want - there are no limitations. 5/5.",
            "The game is still Good, no complaints about it. But i do have a suggestion, its about the clan. Why not add a section where we can see who is active in the clan even if were not in game friends. Cuz it'd be a hassle if everyone would have to add everyone that ever joined the clan, which would be kinda confusing i think. Especially for the Lead, and coleads managing the Clan. Cuz in our case, not everyone uses the clan chat when they should. So i was hoping you could possibly consider this?",
            "Sucks !!! After the last update it sucks !!! All my training time for troops is gone back to the time when I unlocked them for example I've upgraded my dragons to the level where they took 3 minutes to train after the update they're taking 3 minutes !! And it's not only the dragons and also not the only bug !! It has ruined the total experience !! And also it's Clan war league going on !! Supercell what have you done !!😒😡 And yeah your in game help and support center sucks even more !😡 Fix it",
            "Love the game came back after 2.5 years and a lot has changed since then. New things have been introduced like th12 and th13 new troops. Graphics are also improved. 4 star because me and my friends are having a glitch since our native language is not english we type in hindi using english alphabet and the game converts in astriks like ****. this pls fix it its really annoying. Rest is fine . Thank you."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "I actually played this since last year. I was happy when the update released but my only request is to bring back the old shield in spearton. It was cool but after the before update, the shield was circle and round. It kinda looked bad for me in my opinion so I just want the old one back. But overall, The game is so good and I love the game modes and levels. I hope soon there will be a new troop called the jet force which it will only defend only the base. I just wanted a flying troop. 😊",
            "I have been playing this game, since you copied the stick war game in Y8 and also since when I was 7 years old, but I still love this game, I know every possible way to defeat every levels without thousands of gems, the other players don't understand what they're playing, because they don't know strategy. So my request is I need 6 lines on my men, not 4, like in the stick war in Y8, I need more men to line in 6 lines, that is only my request, I need 6 lines in a formation.",
            "Its a game that is addicting you leave you think your done with it .....but your not. You just keep seeing it and endup downloading and undownloading again and again untill u just leave it installed to play when ever you wont. One of the game s I have left on and countiue to have in ever new phone I get. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is cause its to addicting.",
            "I love this game. I love how you can play as each individual character, it doesnt make the game feel like an idle game. It would be great if you guys can add more characters which then means you add more campaigns. Id suggest adding a flying character, horsemen, samurais and etc. I like the theme of the game where it sticks to historical and non fiction characters. All in all, great game. Keep it up 👍",
            "The campaign is okay. The tournament & weekly missions are VERY P2W. You can use flawless tactics & the enemy is designed to come with such overwhelming force that after normal mode, if you don't spend thousands of currency to win... You're CRUSHED with impunity. It would be a decent game otherwise. Good for 10 hours of play time. Move along quick."

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

        "description": "You've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\nYou've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\n\r\n1. Don't use tobacco\r\nUsing any type of tobacco puts you on a collision course with cancer. Smoking has been linked to various types of cancer — including cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, larynx, pancreas, bladder, cervix and kidney. Chewing tobacco has been linked to cancer of the oral cavity and pancreas. Even if you don't use tobacco, exposure to secondhand smoke might increase your risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAvoiding tobacco — or deciding to stop using it — is an important part of cancer prevention. If you need help quitting tobacco, ask your doctor about stop-smoking products and other strategies for quitting.\r\n\r\n2. Eat a healthy diet\r\nAlthough making healthy selections at the grocery store and at mealtime can't guarantee cancer prevention, it might reduce your risk. Consider these guidelines:\r\n\r\nEat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Base your diet on fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant sources — such as whole grains and beans.\r\nAvoid obesity. Eat lighter and leaner by choosing fewer high-calorie foods, including refined sugars and fat from animal sources.\r\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, do so only in moderation The risk of various types of cancer — including cancer of the breast, colon, lung, kidney, and liver — increases with the amount of alcohol you drink and the length of time you've been drinking regularly.\r\nLimit processed meats. A report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, concluded that eating large amounts of processed meat can slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancer.\r\nIn addition, women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts might have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active\r\nMaintaining a healthy weight might lower the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon, and kidney.\r\n\r\nPhysical activity counts, too. In addition to helping you control your weight, physical activity on its own might lower the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.\r\n\r\nAdults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits. But for substantial health benefits, strive to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. You can also do a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine — and if you can do more, even better.\r\n\r\nKeywords:-\r\n\r\n1. Cancer\r\n2. Medical\r\n3.

            "I really have nothing else to say. The app is a lost cause. I made a point many years ago when the app was first launched about the app kept messing up the syncing process between the quantity or record of a wine entry with the record at the database server. This problem was never fixed! Today I found the same error with the quantity of a wine I have just couple days ago, and I found the quantity of the wine was unchanged. Can u trust a tech company can't even get its database syncing right?",
            "This should allow two ratings. For looking up wines and getting descriptions and reviews, this app is great. You can even take a photo of the label and most of the time it'll find it. This has kept me away from accidentally buying sweet wines (not my gig). Love it for this use. Then I used Vivino for ordering wine - I have done it twice. Once the order was placed and weeks later it didn't ship. No notice why or if it would be shipped. Cancelled that. Later I tried again, ordering a case of one of my go-to wines from a different sub-retailer in Vivino. The order was shipped in a very reasonable time this order, but upon opening it they had substituted for the entire case with a different wine. No warning, just did it. Were it one bottle, I would be (only) ok with this, but for a case, without warning, this is unacceptable. The thing that has ended my ordering on Vivino is that, having had this happen, I can't get Vivino to even answer an email or respond to the 'contact' tab on their site. I frankly don't know if anyone works there anymore, certainly nobody is manning the email address or contact input. I have reached out both ways for the third time today and will be calling the credit card to have the charges reversed.",
            "Why only 4 stars?! The application is good, pretty sure I'll use it for several times, but the 1st thing I noticed, that the tutorial after the \"see how it works\" button is completely unreadable (at least for me it is..). Light brownish background with small grey text. Please take into consideration to change it. :)",
            "Love it and recommend it often. It's a great way to broaden your palette. I've tried so many new wines based on a decent rating and generally been happy I did. Also helped me to avoid a few bad ones.",
            "Used to be a good app, but now it's just annoying when it takes over your screen to install a non-existent update, that usually comes along a week after the first red screen appears. Suggestions to remove the annoyance have gone unheard (contacted via the app)"

            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right now🤷🏻‍♀️. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",
            "Game is great.. expensive if you want to keep up...but it never ever connects for me the 1st time . and it's not my interent it's your server...One time I have to use my interent then I have to use my data..and most times I have to go back and forth 3 or 4 times to see which it will take...and this is every single day a few times a day .it never is the same and takes forever to load when it finally gets working.. but I do love the game! I am addicted just wish you would fix those 2 things..."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",

So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for.

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "To be honest a lot of post on here about the game(mobile strike) being pay to win is pretty much 80% acurate there are some times your base is better but then there comes the dude that spent $20 more than you and just claps all your troops the game has alot of potentail but is already a failing game just becuase the game devs just want so extra money. So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",
            "Cost to much ti play i have been playing this game for years i spent alote of money on it and the change up to cyber we that were playing before that had to spend much more and the stuff we bought before we cant even use even the game packs have alote of stuff but there is 80%of it is stuff u cant use note that we should have renberse use for what we paid for and lost cause of the change up",

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",

I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",
            "I will say it is good app for those who really want to become cardiologist. I am intrested in these types of activities. I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",
            "The first sentence in the dialog has a typo. Decided to overlook it. It seems the dialog is very poor and controls aren't any better.",
            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

It's useless now; severely disappointed.",

When the name changed I got furious thinking somehow a app installed itself. I opened the app and dit not recognized it. Luckily I had sceen shots of my icons abd this is the only way I figured out that this was a app I installed and used.

I uninstalled and reinstalled ( which resulted in me losing everything ) I could log on again!!! Then, later, when I tried to log on it did the same thing. Pls fix IT!!!!! I wanna play I love it sooo much!!!!! If you don't, it will break my heart",
            "This Game is super fun! I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!! Well we should be a new app from witch we can style our phones. Thank you for such an amazing game! I♥PK XD!!!...",
            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",

Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

            "Game is really good. But it can be taken to the next level. Some things I would really love in the game are - 1. Multiplayer mode, 2. Net shots can be better. It shows ' Perfect ' and still hits the net, 3. Not able to defend the smash but the AI defends the smash, 4. Endurance sometimes doesn't work as it claims. 5. Body language can also be improved in each shot. Apart from these, the game is well made.",
            "This is probably one of the best Badminton game on the market. BUT, there's a huge issues that i need to address... FIRST OF, the \"Frozen Time\" special ability in the game is probably the most annoying part of it. Not only that this ability makes the game much more unrealistic (even though it's just a \"mini game\"), but also it makes the game to become imbalance. SECOND OF, when the player beginning to run out of stamina, then suddenly i couldn't even smash the ball while midair. FIX THIS PLEASE",
            "Guest login gives you a random name, can't change the name even though I have google games installed, no achievement or progress there. I don't use facebook there is no other option. The difficulty is not there at all, The AI is completely predictable after few levels. I reached ACE in a day, still no challenge. Apart from all this, I enjoy playing this game.",
            "I played this game ages ago because I was addicted to badminton and was so impressed by what I thought was an online badminton game. This turned out to be single player and i felt quite betrayed, however coming back to it knowing its single player with everything they've added has made me so happy, the shot selection options is so pleasing from someone who has played for many years and its good to see some variations from hit short, hit long, smash. With drive shots etc. The game is very fun.",
            "Yes I have played this game for 2months it was nice but it has some issues and they are 1. It doesn't support solo vs solo from large distances like a person from another city and another city. 2. Their must be some more controls like places and techniques 3. The abiltes are not too fair . If these were resolved I hope I may give 5 🌟 star to it"

        "description": "Finding information about Medicare coverage is easier than ever now. Download the only official U.S. government Medicare app onto your mobile device.\r\n\r\nWhat’s covered helps you understand the health care coverage offered by Original Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance).\r\n\r\nUse this federal government app to:\r\n\r\n-Answer your Medicare coverage questions\r\n\r\n-See information about your costs\r\n\r\n-Learn about covered items & services\r\n\r\n-See notes & where to get more information\r\n\r\n-Browse free preventive services\r\n\r\nOriginal Medicare Items & Services\r\n\r\nFind out what your Medicare coverage has to offer like:\r\n\r\n- When are mammograms covered?\r\n\r\n- Is home health care covered?\r\n\r\n- Will Medicare pay for diabetes supplies?\r\n\r\nPreventive Health Coverage\r\n\r\nMedicare coverage includes preventive services at no cost to you. Preventive services can help keep you healthy by finding health problems early and can keep you from getting certain diseases.\r\n\r\nWhat’s covered will help you answer questions like:\r\n\r\n- Will my Medicare benefits cover services to help me stop smoking?\r\n\r\n- Can I get a cervical cancer screening?\r\n\r\n- How often will my Medicare coverage allow me to get a bone mass measurement?\r\n\r\nAsk your doctor or health care provider which preventive services (like screenings, shots, and tests) you need to get.\r\n\r\nPart A & Part B Costs\r\n\r\nMedicare Part A and Part B cover certain medical services and supplies in hospitals, doctors’ offices, and other health care settings.\r\n\r\nPart A hospital insurance coverage helps pay for inpatient care in a hospital, inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, home health care, or inpatient care in a religious nonmedical health care institution. Copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles may apply for each service.\r\n\r\nPart B medical insurance coverage supports medically necessary doctors’ services, outpatient care, home health services, durable medical equipment, preventive services, and other medical services. Under Original Medicare, if the Part B deductible applies, you must pay all health care costs (up to the Medicare-approved amount) until you meet the yearly Part B deductible. After your deductible is met, Medicare begins to pay its share and you typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount of the service, if the doctor or health care provider accepts assignment. There’s no yearly limit for what you pay out-of-pocket.\r\n\r\nFor some items and services, you must meet eligibility criteria or you may be responsible for paying all costs. Your doctor or health care provider may recommend you get services more often than Medicare covers. Or, they may recommend services that Medicare doesn’t cover.

Download the only official U.S. government Medicare app onto your mobile device.<br><br>What’s covered helps you understand the health care coverage offered by Original Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance).<br><br>Use this federal government app to:<br><br>-Answer your Medicare coverage questions<br><br>-See information about your costs<br><br>-Learn about covered items &amp; services<br><br>-See notes &amp; where to get more information<br><br>-Browse free preventive services<br><br>Original Medicare Items &amp; Services<br><br>Find out what your Medicare coverage has to offer like:<br><br>- When are mammograms covered?<br><br>- Is home health care covered?<br><br>- Will Medicare pay for diabetes supplies?<br><br>Preventive Health Coverage<br><br>Medicare coverage includes preventive services at no cost to you. Preventive services can help keep you healthy by finding health problems early and can keep you from getting certain diseases.<br><br>What’s covered will help you answer questions like:<br><br>- Will my Medicare benefits cover services to help me stop smoking?<br><br>- Can I get a cervical cancer screening?<br><br>- How often will my Medicare coverage allow me to get a bone mass measurement?<br><br>Ask your doctor or health care provider which preventive services (like screenings, shots, and tests) you need to get.<br><br>Part A &amp; Part B Costs<br><br>Medicare Part A and Part B cover certain medical services and supplies in hospitals, doctors’ offices, and other health care settings.<br><br>Part A hospital insurance coverage helps pay for inpatient care in a hospital, inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, home health care, or inpatient care in a religious nonmedical health care institution. Copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles may apply for each service.<br><br>Part B medical insurance coverage supports medically necessary doctors’ services, outpatient care, home health services, durable medical equipment, preventive services, and other medical services. Under Original Medicare, if the Part B deductible applies, you must pay all health care costs (up to the Medicare-approved amount) until you meet the yearly Part B deductible. After your deductible is met, Medicare begins to pay its share and you typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount of the service, if the doctor or health care provider accepts assignment. There’s no yearly limit for what you pay out-of-pocket.<br><br>For some items and services, you must meet eligibility criteria or you may be responsible for paying all costs. Your doctor or health care provider may recommend you get services more often than Medicare covers. Or, they may recommend services that Medicare doesn’t cover.

Plus they also have phone numbers to contact if you are unable to locate all the information you need.",
            "I was able to find part of the Medicare coverage, but it was a guess because it only examined Advantage Plans. Not mine specifically.",
            "When I saw the display saying \"Is my item or service covered?\" I thought I could look up specific service codes related to my condition. Wrong! I could only locate generic topics with no specific yes/no answer relating to me. To me, the answer to a question \"Is covered?\" is a yes or a no answer. This app did not provide it, only \"Topic not found. \" i am greatly disappointed...",
            "When you type in things like Hip Replacement, Knee Replacement, Shoulder Surgery or any other major issues it either comes back with appliances (passive motion machine or physical therapy etc) or nothing at all rather than if that particular issue is covered by Medicare. In other words, this app is woefully lacking in information about what is actually covered by Medicare or at least the percentage covered.",
            "I appreciate that Medicare is trying to make an app to help us know what is covered and how often. However, I am surprised to see that the app was released at a somewhat early stage of development. Compared with the information available on the web site, this app is lacking much information, thus making its usefulness very limited. I will check back every now and then. If the functionality becomes more like the functionality of searching on the web site, this app has very good potential."

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",

            "This game is filled with ads every few seconds, which is understandable to a point, it's free, but those ads should be appropriate for the target audience of the game. Multiple ads have come up that advertise the keto diet and explain that if you don't go on it your partner will hate you, or that your appearance is the only thing that matters. Others advertise animated characters and zoom in inappropriately on their crotch. This is unacceptable for a children's game!",

Just a heads up, there's a lot of ads in this game, but I'm glad the more inappropriate ones don't appear anymore for the sake of its intended audience. To the devs: Minor note as if writing this, her hair in her Halloween outfit sometimes glitches in her sleep.",
            "Great but there's a few glitches. Like the puzzle game. Blocks get stuck at the top half of the screen and you can't move them. The sky high game - you can't get higher that 10 points even if you got all perfects/ even if you watched an ad to keep going. Makeup that you (in game) buy gets removed if you dance with the blue stars and earn temporary makeup. After a day, Once the temporary makeup ends, the other makeup gets removed even if you didn't use the temporary makeup. Pls fix ♥️",
            "This game is very good,relaxable,enjoyable and many good things about this game I love this game so much ,,,but Can you please fix the bugs. When l go to store to buy sticker for watch ad (data off) and when l turn on the data it will show that 20 diamonds. I RECOMMOND THE INSTALLERS THAT PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS FOR ENJOY, EXICTMENT, RELAX AND FEEL GOOD",
            "This game is very good there is one problem reason for 4 stars. Every time I went out and went back in then it kept on saying go to the previous game or start a new game then every time I went to the previous game it made me start everything overeverything like the sleeping and they're eating and applying and the dancing went to 0%"

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",

May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "I purchased a year subscription a couple months ago. It was great now in this last week it has so many glitches and each item doesn't want to open takes forever! And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "It's and ok game, I just wish there were more mini games and the different areas for animals should be such high levels to get. Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",

When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

            "I loved the game at first I even made it to level 50. However, after months of playing the game investing my time and money it rebooted and made me start over from level 1. They took away my home and Sims family. I was so disappointed. They have since fixed this problem and returned my level and items. I love this game.",
            "Ok. I like this game. But one thing that i really don't like is that they don't notify us of new updates in the game. I would have to go to playstore everytime i suspect there's new updates. Sometimes i would have missed more than a week during an event before i update and i miss good products. So I really hope they would change that and notify us within the game. Otherwise i love it.",
            "I love the game but some things are still quite annoying in it, like the challenges, some are impossible to get unless you make use of real money to purchase sim cash. It think they should make the challenges quite easier to win reward becos some people can't always afford that. I am also hoping to see pets and cars in the game. By the way nice one EA and Maxis",
            "Quite good mobile adaptation of The Sims game. Enjoyable. -- Problem though: My Sim is female but Izzy designed male clothes for me on the first try, and still male on the second try. My starter Fashion Gems all wasted since females can't wear male clothes. Suggestions: 1) make Izzy able to detect the current Sim's gender or allow us to choose. 2) State the requirements of player's name so that we don't have to keep guessing why it gets rejected.",
            "Have all sims in collection. All great only complaint in this game is the loading and the none selling of items in storage.Be good if could add more sims. Over all great game. Am enjoying it. If the situations were resolved i would give a 5 stars. cheers.."

            "I like this app, it's the best scanner and really easy to organise. I didn't give full stars because there isn't an option to edit the name, or edit the documents. Like scan a few more, or delete a few once you have saved it onto the device. If I make a mistake I have to rescan everything. Nonetheless, I am still using this app because there are no ads and it's a quality scanner!",
            "It's a nice app, especially if you have an outlook account. When you save it, it saves directly to your account after you log in once, and you can also choose what to save it as (pdf, jpeg, etc. . .). The only thing is, if you have bad lighting, sometimes the scanner won't pick up the edges of your paper. Which is a given for any scanner, but if you're in a rush it can cost you time. It doesn't have pop up ads like some other scanners I've used so that's also a plus.",
            "This is an amzing app. If we click a photo for scanning from any angle, it automatically makes the photo clear and straight. I could have given 5 stars to this app, if there could be one more feature in it. Today I had to scan the images of my test paper and by mistake, I forgot one page to scan. So I scanned it at the last thinking that *there will be an option to reorder the pages in a correct format*. But I wasnt able to reorder. Please add page reordering feature in this app. Thank you.😊",
            "I couldn't find a proper pdf creator and was in desperate need of one due to my exams. Them I found this and I am so very grateful that I did. Works just fine and captures the document from whichever angle I click. Only one thing, today I forgot to rename the file before saving it. And then I couldn't find any option to rename it. So I had to click the pictures of the pages again. If there is a renaming option, please help me find it but if not, that's an improvement you must make."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Thanks Brothers, I love JW app 💗💗💗 However, recently I am experiencing an issue with it and I am wondering if you would be able to help me please. It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet 🤗💖",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",
            "One of the Best scary apps in android..but u guys have to do some new challenges or new maps i mean bigger maps ..like if u got 20/20 money u go outside and u keep playing to get a car to run away or somthing like that"

            "It is superb game but , at cat 🐈 level it struck and it shows only loding .So ,then I uninstalled it but after some time I install it then I started playing again but at cat 🐈 level it struck again . It's previous levels are super I want to play more level . It has too many glitches .",

            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

            "Great Game, Ridiculous Pricing! I downloaded Paint By Numbers recently and found that I really enjoyed it. They make painting these fun, there's a rewards system and achievements. I liked it so much that I decided to buy it... that is until I saw the pricing. $5 a WEEK!! Or the option for $70 EVERY YEAR! No thanks. Game is great, but pricing model killed it.",
            "Hi, I really really love this game the best, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because when i went today to check my library which is were I finished the pictures, the pictures won't show colored they would show blank and I tried to color them back but when I left the app and came back all my pictures that I painted are blank again! So please fix it then I will enjoy it and give a five star overall I recommend this game its so relaxing and its addictive omg I love this app.",
            "Very relaxing way to spend a few minutes. Pick your pictures right and they come out brilliantly. Only thing I had to change was the highlighter to a brighter one, couldn't see the grey one. Other than that it's great, and addictive, once you have done one and seen what it looks like you immediately want to do another. Finished ones can also be downloaded 👍",
            "Had to factory reset my phone and now all of my purchased gems are gone as well as completed pictures and purchased collections. No ok at all. Further to my review, ive contacted support numerous times to no avail. Ive done everything asked of me, provided sufficient answers to all questions and provided evidence. Ive been fobbed off and told \"we will look into it\" and \"we will fix this\" over and over but nothings been fixed. Either give me my gems back or refund my money. Con artists & thiefs!",
            "I really love this app. The pictures are super awesome! I can however only give 3 stars for now cause everytime I finish a picture it wants to play an ad(which is fine) if the ads worked. With the ads not working I can't move on to the next picture. If that was fixed I would give 5 stars no prob. But I can only do one picture and have to close the app. If you made it so I can continue even if the ads don't actually play I would also give 5 stars. Thanks for your time! Much love."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Like so many reviewers, we paid to remove ads and they are still there. They went away after we paid, but after we closed and restarted game again, the ads came back and aren't going away. DON'T pay to remove ads - it's a scam.",
            "Its a very cute game but i wish they would add more things to do but it an amazing game and if the add are bothering people they should tern off inernet/wifi. Its a great game!😁😁😁"

            "I like this game so much but after the Halloween update, it looks like it needs more data and I can't play a smooth game🙁 Sometimes when I earn so much coins, suddenly it will show like 'Talking Tom Hero Dash isn't responding'. And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Bed wars...kind of fun game but I only have one problem from the game. The joystick, when I always walk on the bridge (The one with wool that players can buy from game) it always go to the right side of my joystick!!! So I fall down when the joystick let me go to the right. Please fix this bug!!!!",
            "Ok so I got this a few days ago and have already seen hackers and people braking the game. Although it's a very fun game and you will have alot of fun playing. It would be better if it had the creatures or ender pearls(preferably both). And make to where it's one of those games where its you die in the first 3 Minutes of the game. If you fix some or all of these issues I will raise my rating. Other than that I enjoy this game very much so. It is worth downloading.",
            "Sometimes I wonder why this game is still up. I can't even count how many people I see hacking, breaking the game, and more clown moves. And the game producers have done nothing to fix it. So it is really annoying playing the game. But I can't stop beneath all the stuff I listed it is a really adictive game which is why I didnt give one star. But if these things dont get fixed I would rather play something else.",
            "I love this game!!!! it's soo fun..in the real Minecraft bedwars the swords,fireball and more cost ALOT of iron ,gold , diamonds and emeralds and it's harder to PvP so this game is better!!! please make more game's I love this too much!! I hope everyone is doing well and happy in carona virus (covid 19). 🙂🙂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🤍",
            "I only tell honest reviews. This is mine for this game: This game is probably one of the best games for android outside of Minecraft for blocky graphics. It has a very Minecrafty feel to it and I really enjoy playing this. Congrats to the developers. It has every basic weapon that ordinary BedWars has and then some. I also enjoy that everything works like it does is real deal Minecraft. Definitely a good pick."

            "Hi NESM.This game is good it is good, but the things are hard to get like hulk and some other weapons I rate it 5 but please be sure to fix this problem for the people who have money it's easy but people who dont it's hard. Plz make hulk cheaper. Thank u.",
            "The game is epic, I'm not gonna lie. The first thing that irritates me is, I cannot see the gauge of other sticks. I just keep on fighting them until I can't fight no more. The second thing is, we can't take other sticks' weapons after they have died. If they die, they must leave the weapons behind so that I can take them and finish the rest of the sticks off. Those are the only things that I wanna see in the game. Maybe you'll add them in Anger Of Stick 6: The End Of The World 😃😃",
            "Very good and additive game but only one problem; can you change the archer control function? It is a bit difficult to aim and yes one thing! I think you should add horse riders BTW very well done ✅ keep updating 🤠 Thank you 😊"

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "This is supposed to be fun, not frustrating or leaving you feeling like you've been ripped off. The new update has changed the payouts on all the games of chance. Even if you get a \"special casino night\" it's a major rip-off. I started out with over 260 diamonds on my \"special\" hour and it took all of my money and my diamonds. I've already decided the \"Star Club\" aint worth it (tried it) The game isn't much fun unless you have diamonds-too expensive -my advice is PASS!! My id is Qpydz542.",
            "I love the game there are no ads in it. You can dress up style yourself your two bff will help you in this journey. Meet many people in the game u can even invite your friends to play with you. But there is 1 thing that I don't like in it that all the things are very expensive gems r less but give amazing dresses that which has to change and there are only 3 eye ball colours and eye shadow colours. Over all it is a lovely and amazing game u should try the game once in your life. 😍😇😁😁",
            "I like it, it's a fun game. I think the price of the clothing cost way to many diamonds, and not enough of them cost cash, mostly everything cost diamonds. And you don't get many with purchase unless you make a large purchase. And the up scale clothing stores should give gift bags. And why do I have to pay for a date? Haha.",
            "I want to take the time to express my thoughts on this very very cool game! I believe that while I am a star member there is really no benefit to it. $19.95 a week is way more then you should be asking for. It is misleading. You still have to spend money to get ahead not to mention the runway battles are REDICULOUS. It is full of cheaters wearing skirts on top of dressed and looking completely silly yet they win. And the ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM IS TO JOIN THEM HOWEVER IT'S not even fun anymore!!!",
            "I'm irritated that everything that can help you in the Fashion Arena cost diamonds!! I'm irritated that I did the download of that stupid chef game and finished the tutorial but never recieved the reward for it so I had to spend 5 diamonds to skip it so I could continue with the storyline. It sucks that everytime you get \"busted\" in recieving gifts from fans the price of continuing goes up. This isnt a game. It's a money pit!!!"

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "I have to say the graphics are really good, but sometimes, the ref gives a foul or yellow card when it is clearly not a foul. But the quality is good and in multiplayer, although it lags, it has exciting gameplay. I was and I am still critical because you have removed DLS 19, but this sort of wins it back. Pl focus on the improvements and add DLS 19 ( if possible)",
            "Easily could've gotten 5 star with the gameplay itself. But ads every half time is terrible. I do watch ads to get extra coins so no need to put it at the half time. Also the cost for stadium is too expensive. You really expect the player to score 10 goals every game? Can't improve the squad and have to watch ads after every game just for the stadium upgrade bullcrap. That's just plain stupid.",
            "So many things to improve. 1. The analog joystick. When my players make a long shot, the ball still move towards the goalkeeper even when I move the joystick to the top corner of the goal. 2. The goalkeeper's reaction doesn't make sense. Even the GK from PES still can be defeated at short range, unlike the GK in DLS 20. 3. The goalkeeper still error. You can review that game again. I don't know how to explain it ~_~",
            "Out of all of the football games I have played, the controls and smooth gameplay that DLS offers is far better than the competition. PES and Fifa struggle to create such a unique and lag free experience, but every year DLS improves their already superior controls. DLS is in no way a pay to win game like Fifa and is a very enjoyable game. Everything about it is a 10/10 from me.",
            "I love this game and wanted to give 5* but damn! Some things really piss me off. 1. Why don't we have control over how we upgrade our players anymore? 2. Why don't we have the options to sell our players for money 🤦 Now the multiplayer experience is getting worse. It will disconnect even if there's strong network connection. And the other person wins. And your team's fitness drops.... Too bad"

            "I enjoyed it alot, but I finished it really quickly. I loves it so much tho. I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yes🤞"

KASHF also works towards providing information and guidance to facilitate the early detection of many types of cancer, i.e. breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate, melanoma, and colon cancer. KASHF's first project is flagged through the Pink Caravan initiative which was especially designed to raise awareness around breast cancer and to encourage both women and men, residing within the United Arab Emirates, to perform self-examinations and go for regular meChdical check-ups.\r\n\r\nThe initiative was launched under the patronage of HRH Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah and under the directives of HH Sheikha Jawaher Bint Mohammed Al-Qasimi, Wife of the Ruler of Sharjah, Founder and Royal Patron of the Friends of Cancer Patients charitable society (FoCP), Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) International Ambassador for Childhood Cancer, and UICC International Ambassador of the World Cancer Declaration.\r\n\r\nThe Pink Caravan aims to raise awareness around breast cancer early detection and screening methods, lobby for the creation of the first UAE National Cancer Registry, and raise sufficient funds to purchase and operate a state of the art mobile mammography unit. The Pink Caravan ride takes place annually, focusing across all seven emirates of the UAE, including remote and outlying areas. Over 150 experienced equine riders join forces each year, garnering support across different sectors, bringing together schools, universities, corporations, Pink Caravan ambassadors and royalty. The funds raised during this awareness campaign will ensure the availability of the latest technology and highest quality in the early screening and detection of breast cancer, making services accessible to every woman and man in the UAE.\r\n\r\nA novel and unique initiative, the Pink Caravan has garnered widespread recognition locally, regionally, and internationally. To date the Pink Caravan Ride has travelled over 900 km across the seven emirates, with over 250 riders and 200 volunteers helping to ensure its success. Lectures and presentations were delivered at more than 100 schools and more than 250 mobile medical clinics offering early breast cancer detection examinations have been set up with more than 22,877 people, including over 5,450 men, being screened.

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "Limited moves,too much money to keep up w/ game you can't plsy ,2out of 3 only 1set at s time. The makers off this game did a really good job at first.but i beat the game without spending money but when you get to the top you play against a supper bot you can't go around over or away it won't let me and blocks are happens out of the blue you designed a game that was indestructible.but i kicked you ass and so you can win .that is full shi_ and your game needs to cheat so you can't win 0 stars.",
            "Interesting but wayyy too slow paced. Theres not enough players online so it take forever to match up in multiplayer to earn coins and the \"story mode\" has a waiting time for every match which is wayyy to long. Both of these make earning credits too hard in the game which makes it too slow to progress and increase your skill in the game. Developers should add another way to earn credits that doesnt have a limit or waiting time.",
            "Ya very good appl. If u are interested in volleyball. It has one most worst point in which it allows to play only at when time arrived in case of offline and another point is that in case of online playing u player won't come soon it Will take lots of time and sometimes it won't connect also.",
            "It's a really fun game If it had more specific players like a libero, a setter n ace then it would be amazing also make getting coins easier if it's through ads or weekly packs n stuff then it will definitly be a 5 star game i really hope you add these features cuz it'll be truly awsome!",

            "Great game! A good time piece for lockdown. However... the new update rolled out today and I am on of the 1 in 5 males who suffer from colour blindness. The new darker colour scheme does not work for me. Will it stop me from playing? Probably not, though the previous version was better suited to my disability. It would be good if the developers could look at winding it back. Naturally there are a few bugs in the new version also, namely trying to play another game. It freezes on my Samsung S10",
            "Really good for the CS fans. Few bugs, about the final tally and lag in the game. Rest, still online game, it feels like AI or computer or bots playing the game. Difficulty level can be increased. Secondly, making squad and playing with friends is the issue.. We have to restart game after every match.. New update, people are hacking it easily.. They are not dying to head shots also.. Nevertheless grt game.. ❤️❤️",
            "Latest update is really bad. It has lot many bugs. Please fix all the bugs soon or Revert your code changes to previous version that was really good and stable. It is not allowing all the players to be in the game. Sometimes only 2 or 3 including CT and T. And sometimes only one player. LOL. How can we play with ourself.",
            "You have ruined the game after new upgrade.. listing down few problems.. - It's taking too much time to join the lobby and teams r not balanced after joining and sometimes no one else is joining. This is most serious problem. U hv ruined it. - Players r joining in mid of the game. - CT has also bomb after team flip..lol - No option to exit the game after joining the lobby. Many issues with UI",
            "Additive game. Critical Review: 1.sometimes don't starts properly saying network issue, despite network is perfectly ok. 2. Latest oct. Fancy UI upgrade made the game slow. Kindly make sure I was using ultra high quality video in previous version and game was working perfectly. In the recent version even high quality lags. 3. Games works at medium quality but it's very irritating for eyes. Feature Request: Add live voice intrection with others if possible."

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "It's one of the best dress up apps out there, there's plenty of items and (so far) there doesn't seem to be a limit on saved dolls. It would be cool if they added a way to sort your characters into folders of sorts so that it's easier to find a character you're looking for. Edit: After the last update I started getting adds on the top and bottom of my screen again even though I previously paid to remove them. Down to three stars until this is resolved.",
            "Oh my!This game is F.A.B,I just really adore the details!YOUR GRAPHICS ARE REAAAAALLY GOOD👍!!! I hope my reccomendations help!: Pls add the ability to choose earings,neclaces,sleeves,shirts,pants etc. and i hope we can change the colors! I want more eye designs and be able to color them+They can blink! If we could add like animations that make the hair look like its flying by the wind it would be cool! 😮 add poses and i wanna be able to make stories with this app,anything pls! #SORECOMMENDED!",
            "I really enjoy this app! It's fun, creative, and has beautiful music.There are only 2 things it's missing: 1: if you could change the colours on everything (eyes, clothes, shoes ect.) that would be great! 2: it would be fab if you could put your chibi doll in different poses, as I think the regular standing pose is a bit boring.",
            "This game is very fun it is amazing it's a creating a character it's just like God's club but very different than go to club I love it so much I love how you can like change the look of your characters so much but I wish they would add somewhere that you can makeup a name for your character but it is very fun it's a very creative fashionable game well not that fashionable 😂😂😂😂😂 Well download it if you haven't",
            "Great game so awesome game 8 year old girl so good I recommend you make more games like this ... I'm a fan of MLP my little pony .. I made a mlp chibi dolls so great hope you upgrade .. the game ..or make more like this game.. 😀😃👍👍👍👍👍......"

I was in one of the top ten alliances, and I've never seen such tribalistic, immature morons, who banned me without warning for speaking out against spammed alliance-wide messages.",

I think the same thing will happen on My Talking Tom 2! I love Talking Angela sooooo much! Even though people say there's a man in her eyes, I never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever see the man. Talking Angela is sooooo cute!",
            "So I was playing I noticed a vid that came up on YouTube ig was on the news too so I went to check it out and when I came back at first I didn't believe it then wen I got back I saw that the makeup was off her face and floating in the air. I when back where you download it and then saw the pictures of a man in her eyes. I went to go crash my phone the I heard something in the woods so I looked the doors around my house. Then my sister was asleep and I fall asleep too.",
            "Omg literally I just played this from I year and I was playing and I notice that the app is haunted but I love the cat so what just happened is that I just open the app today and angela eyes were red and It was like someone is there behind her and I just ran that time to show that to my parents and there was no one in the chair but I though that it may be some problem of phone and I told hi angela she told hi I am a devil ,i am a devil,and that time i was very scared and i dont want to keep that",
            "I haven't played this game yet I did this ad before I started and going in the game but I heard it's very creepy and if you zoom into the eye then you can see a manner something then yeah I just look on YouTube and I saw a bunch of pictures I mean and then I see that someone is watching you when you play the game so I'm very scared to start of the game right now so yeah wish me good luck so I won't die okay",
            "I was playing and I noticed that there was something or someone in her eye. I saw some things that looked like an and a couch. I screenshoted the eyes and saw those. I thought it was really creepy. I instantly deleted the game after I discovered the things in the eyes. Kids don't download this game without your parents. I think the person that made the game was the person in the eyes. I rate this 1 star cause I thought it was creepy and uncomfortable having someone just staring at you, thats all"

            "For being one of the largest television providers, your app is hot garbage. Not easy to navigate or find what you're looking for. But the DVR functionality is the worst. The whole point of the app is to be able to watch what I pay for on the go, and be able to access my DVR. The app syncs to my box but as soon as I leave my wifi I can no longer access my DVR shows. Fix this immediately!",
            "1. Difficulty logging on! 2. While watching a TV program. A commercial comes on. After the commercial the program puts me back to the beginning of the show. Then you have to toggle and try to find where you were. If you don't hit the right spot you go to another commercial and you have to wait again or go back to the beginning of the program. 3. The toggle to forward or reverse your position in a TV show is very sensitive and hard to use. I'm very surprised at DirecTV with such a sloppy program.",
            "Absolutely the worst app ever. Every show I try to watch restarts from the beginning after the first set on endless commercials. When I try to return to where I left off, the app either freezes, starts fast forwarding, plays picture with no sound, or sound with no picture. Rediculous! And I'm only giving 1 star because you're forcing me to before letting me post.",
            "I suppose it works to watch stuff On Demand if you missed something yesterday, same thing you can do on a computer. But, I don't comprehend how this app, for years, still has some sort of problem when watching your own DVR. It fails all the time. Today, I download an episode of a show. It finishes within 10 minutes. I open up my Downloads, it's not there. I download it again, the 10 minutes pass, again, and then it's finally marked as downloaded and ready. And yet. I click play, and it crashes.",
            "Does a lot of buffering even when connected to wifi. Drives me nuts that it doesn't keep track of where I am in previously watched shows. Then if I try to skip forward to find where I left off, I have to sit through 3 mins of commercials. No matter if I skip forward 20 mins or 2 mins. Again, this could be avoided if the app did a better job of tracking previously watched shows."

            "Hella lame. It's less of a game and more of platform to serve ads. After each level where you help prisoners escape, you're forced to build them a mansion, can't skip it, which just serves to force 3 ads instead of 1 on you. And then it gets stuck on an add, you have to restart the game to get out of the add. Not playable",
            "I won't give less than 1 star.... That's why, I'm giving this game 1star. If there is any option to give less than 1 star then, I'll definitely choose that option. Don't download and waste your time. Please move on another game. The only thing that you can enjoy in this app is Ads. But they are also boring. Just think twice before you download this app !!!!! I have wasted my precious time. But you can save your time, by simply uninstall or don't install this app. Very boring game 😏😒😬",
            "I won`t write alot, but ths game is goooooooood! It is soooooo fun and amazing. Using a laptop makes this more easier to play this game(to me). The thieves run,and you can just hold down on the screen,swiping wherever to clear out the dirt....... I really suggest you guys to download this game!",
            "This is a outstanding game. You can play this game without ads without giving money to the game or whatever but if you have no problem to turn off your mobile data or the wi-fi which you are connected to or if you are using a broadband. I am playing the game with an ad free service kinda with turning off my wi-fi and etc. It's my first day of the game and I am enjoying an 'ad free game'. Thank you ------- Chandraja Saha",

Do NOT download this app for your own safety (confirmed by laurenzside, police & other youtubers)",

I LIKE IT...<>",

            "Okay I buy this when I was nine and right when I got in it I freeked out I saw a man with a thing on his mouth I did play this I was not scared first i read the comments about this game...But Im vary dumb kids do not buy it.My legs shaked when I saw his eyes 0-0 Just do not buy this game pls!!♥",

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",

You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "I think this game is amazing! Definitely recommend! 👍The graphics and flow of the movement is very good! And yes there's ads. (Obviously) But unlike most other games like these, the ads barely even bother you! The only trouble I'm having is sometimes when I collect keys or coins it lags just a bit, not enough to mess up the entire \"round\" though. Also anytime I'm trying to buy something (With in-game coins) It will switch to another thing like toppings or food items and buy those instead.PlzFix",
            "Game is fun but the levels actually only repeat it's self, i got all the foods with in 2 days, i got the unicorn in 1 day and the space cat in the 2nd day, i reccomend this game if u like saticefying games, add a longer and better level every now and then it would be great,i gave 3 stars because of the repeating levels and the quick ones to and because it is not very creative 👍🏻🙃",
            "I just downloaded this game and I already like it!Its very fun and reminds me of when me and my mum were baking together!It is hard to keep the cream on the foods,yes but besides from that I recommend downloading it! Also something pretty Annoying can happen where there is too many adds but the game 'yes that dress'(wich I'll recommend downloading to)has adds every next button so the game 'yes that dress'has more adds",
            "To say it's kinda boring but normally it's a very good game it's so much fun and it has a bit of slow motion when I ice the cream on top of the strawberries and waffles and just installed this game today!I'm 8 years old but this is 3 stars it's kinda boring",
            "I saw this in an ad ao i decided to try it. The idea itself sounlds not to bad, but it turned out to be a bit laggy and had this vibration everytime i squeezed the cream? I think the vibration is the point but i think the vibration feeling is annoying and bothering"

            "I loved playing this game but for some reason the fortune wheel & extra 2 lives is not working after the last update. Also having done all the levels it has become boring.",
            "No other issues since your help. Great game, was wondering if you are adding more rooms. I have just about finished all the rooms available completely. Are there going to be any more rooms added, I have almost finished the rooms completely even getting the 100 gems in each room.",
            "So far it seems pretty good but I really wish there was a design game like this one with word games instead of matching.",
            "It would have been worth 5 stars if you hadn't added the votes section. It's a match 3 game! If I wanted to be forced to vote on other people's designs I would be playing redecor which I also have on my device! When I play match 3 Renovation games I want to play by myself without other people! But since you added this feature I will be permanently deleting this game as you have ruined the experience for me! You should be ashamed of trying to turn a match 3 game into a sad version of design home!",
            "I love this game I really can not complain I know that I have just installed it but I have no problems with the game so that is why I gave the game 5 stars I would seriously advice people to install this game because you can play it without data(offline) 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💓💓"

            "I'm very picky with games, and this just managed to get past that barrier with stunning graphics and controls, its just a couple things that caught me off-guard. 1. Please add an arachniphobic option for those who need it! 2. Its hard to really progress when the banner keeps coming. 3. I feel like there isn't a good way to get farther. Every time you uninstall it or stop playing for a certain amount of time, it will wipe your data! 4. Everytime you jump, sometimes it pauses it for some reason :\\",
            "The graphics are incredibly amazing for a game that does not lagg very much. I like how tjere are a lot of things to do and you can live either indoor or outdoor and can raise a family too! Though the adds banner does get reaaallly annoying. It comes like everytime I go to sleep. And the skins are quite expensive. I understand you want some money, but maybe you should lower the amount of times the banner shows up.",
            "I underestimated this game. At first, I expected it to be a low quality game like most other simulators, but I was wrong! The graphics are great, I love the family feature and the customization, and especially the house area! Of course, the game can start to feel repetitive and slow, sometimes it just depends on your mood. I think it would be interesting to have more areas (like a modern world, a park, stores), or have more landscapes, like desert and snow. Overall, this is a great game!",
            "I love this game it is the best no bugs or gitches but i do want ,new places like the basement in the house and more mushrooms not amanitas , and you can add upstairs in the house or a grocery store and i wish the cats in the game could have kittens and for the mice more babies at 1 time pls, and add humans! well nice game!",
            "Still too sensitive and now the game is way too difficult. you spend all your time gathering instead od exploring like before. and by the time you half finish one quest you're too tired and hunrgy to get much farther. in short, this game got worse since I last played it in 2017"

            "I'm giving it 3 stars just because it is a very fun game and I play it fairly often. The lack of a 4th & 5th Star is simply because it is heavily geared (pun intended) towards pushing one to spend on IAP's. There are campaign zones, arena missions, PVP (this last is pointless once you get past the tutorial stage), and each zone or stage calls for certain weaponry, armor, perks, etc, which will cost you a lot of money as you upgrade equipment and buy better along the way. Fun game, but costly.",
            "I do like this game, nice and challenging at times and fun to play, but I think grenades should be added to the game. Do this and I'll give 5 star. (Update); Demoting to 2 star as I'm confused with lvl 27 on the third campaign map (Road Block Rumble) as I've seen a few vids on YouTube, it shows an armoured vehicle next to the guy on the left. But for some reason on my game, that vehicle is not there and is next to impossible to do. If this is a glitch, please fix and I'll give 5 star.",
            "It's amazing and I couldn't think of anything else it's challenging it makes you think it's like a puzzle every time and when you do his shooting part it sad that you're shooting other people lessingham the game is like you're saving a country and an existing secure in the army or you're a soldier saving its family or everything is just gonna be so much fun and it's really interesting when you play, and I just I love it so much! And it's just amazing So this thing's amazing!!!",
            "I have enjoyed this game greatly although there is a definite advantage to those who wish to spend a small fortune but it is what it is game on. I have not stated the game could not be played merely that there is a distinct advantage to those who wish to spend cash on the game. I do enjoy playing it just wish there were atleast some better options for obtaining premium weapons. Like completion of special levels to earn say a premium alien weapon or zombie weapon that would be more beneficial",
            "PVP is a waste. You play against the computer times I played. Developers will tell you otherwise, but they're lying. I quit playing it for the most part. No real sense playing when you're spotted as soon as you enter. You've no idea where they are, but they watch you for a few seconds then kill you. Or they'll disappear and appear elsewhere and get you. Better yet, you'll have one in your scope, he's looking down, as you're about to shoot, he looks up and shoots you. So the developers are lying."

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",
            "Some of the fonts in other apps have change to outline after using this spp. I like help but not unnecessary changes. It is hard to read outline words. Hope you can look into this matter. Will things be back to normal should I uninstall this app.",
            "I have always downloaded the CM Apps...Launcher, Security, Cleaner, Booster, Locker...etc Before I activate any new phone I make sure my CM Apps are in place. I have had very good results with the CM Guys and Gals and keep up the Fantastic Job !!! Colleen",
            "Terrible, terrible app. Unlock your phone and see an app. Unlock your phone to see the weather you never asked for. Whenever you plug it in to charge, it locks the phone. More of an inconvenience than useful"

It can also just be fun and silly. It all depends on what you're looking for. I only have one real complaint and it's that I wish you had more characters to write a comment with. I'm an extremely long winded person and the limit makes it feel difficult to communicate efficiently for me. I haven't had the app for very long though. 🤷🏾‍♀",
            "This app is amazing !!! It keeps you very entertained and you can spend hours on it without being bored , but there are lots of problems , minor problems and big problems. A big problem for example would be Tik Tok deleting random videos which really annoys me , some of my favourite videos have been deleted for no reason , and another huge issue is the community , the people in the comments always say mean stuff to the creators of that video and it really bugs me because I feel so bad for them.",
            "I really enjoy the app, very much, but there are a couple/few of things I would love to see updated: *1. Make it possible to edit a video after posting (too many times I have made a last minute change, which (for whatever reason) changed the placement of an embedded text. SO IRRITATING); *2. While in the editing process, make it so the timing duration doesn't disappear; *3. Disclose how one can become \"verified\" (this actually may be in the app somewhere, but I haven't been able to locate it);",
            "I love tiktok. But sometimes the app freezes and its sorta annoying. And why should we have to link our phone number? I can't text like that. And we should be able to have multiple accounts with the same phone number. I know that could be dangerous but you could notify the other account(s) with the same number to see if it is the same person. And until this is fixed I will rate one less star every month.",
            "I like TikTok a lot and it is very addictive - I've found a lot of pages I really like, thanks to the excellent algorithm. However, I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) It'd be nice if there were a setting that allowed you to have the video either be paused or muted when you first open the app , so it wouldn't just start playing out loud in public when you don't want it to. 2) It'd be great if you could make an auto-scroll feature so you could do other things while watching videos."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

Theres clearly lots of towers in the game but i dont want to have to play for 6 months to get them all, at this pace, for me ill probably uninstall.",
            "One of the last updates brought with it an Bad change. One which uses a Ludacris amount of gems. And that would be... The Tap & the idle time upgrades. Which are Essential to the progression of the game. I must ask. Why the change from coins to Premium currency? considering there are 10 Tap upgrades PER Floor. Multiplied by 3 Gems Plus 5 or 6 idle time upgrades If the idle upgrades were Always 5 gems a piece that TOTALS 55 PER FLOOR! ASSUMING the idle upgrades Stay At 5. A piece which is FALSE",

            "I love the way Baby Bus apps have back to back 30 second forced adverts that my 2 year old gets to watch. No way to skip them, but hey, i guess it's okay if you get 2 yr old kid to click and mistakenly install some app. What do you make, 1 cent per install? You guys make quality software, but your attempt to get revenue is horrendous. Let me give my 2.99 to buy an add free experience so that my kid can play in peace, PLEASE."

            "I have no problem with this game. Others say it has about 50 million ads every day, with a 3 star rating or under. The only thing I dislike, are the glitches. But that one problem isn't going to put me off this game for life like it will with all the other whimps out there. I have had tonns of apps and games with ads, but the only reason I felt like deleting them is to download other more fun and popular games I see thanks to the games with lots of ads. So, ads aren't really that bad after all.",
            "Nice casual game. When I have nothing to do i simply open it and it entertains me. But man by every update they are increasing the difficulty. So i want to tell the developers that this game has an image of refreshing and casual game. So the more difficulties you add the more people will not play it. So better for you guys, Make it more entertaining not difficult.",
            "This is such a relaxing game! The ads aren't so bad, cause well, which game doesn't have ads? The only issue I have with the game is that the sounds play whenever the media volume is raised, and they don't stop despite muting them in the settings bar. That's really annoying tbh, and the only reason why I wouldnt give this 5 stars",
            "It is an amazing and addictive game. Really easy to use and child friendly. There are games in which their ads show that the game is like this and this how to use it but then it is different to use.In this game, it shows the true usage of this and the ad is true. This is the most favourite of all time.😘😘😍😍",
            "Ads are one thing, but what they do is after you finish a level, they will offer you a free upgrade if you watch an ad within 10 seconds of clicking it. But even when you decline it, when you try to manually upgrade your character, you are given a free upgrade and you can ONLY upgrade if you FORCEFULLY watch an ad. Get that trash out of your apps you plugs."

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",

            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",

We didn't know we were paying for broken junk. Fix it. 6/20 Playback still bugged. 6/1 Playback still bugged. Still hasn't responded to email. Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",
            "This App became USELESS. It was so good 2years ago, so easy to connect and view the cameras. Wth happened, since I did the update it seems the app has issues connecting. I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. 😡",
            "Was great at first. Now after 3 days of using it the notifcation have stopped. Ive when into app notifaction menu and set to urgent high priority and still nothing. I thought maybe no movement is being dected. So i check playback and sure enough its catching and recording movement but fails to notify me.",
            "The app will not load all my cameras and it's so glitchy. Great cameras and monitor but what's the point of having a app if you can't use it!! Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",
            "All of a sudden, getting no push notifications. When I try to check alerts, I get a message that says \"Failed to get alarm message\". I've checked the settings on my phone to make sure I can get the notifications and every thing is fine. Is this an update issue? Very irritating!"

            "It is a very good game, for when you probably worked on this for months or even a year. One thing I would love is where you can drive cars and drive through cities and housework missions, where you can go to shops if you want it more realistic, you can keep the tablet. Then, you can have other drivers with turn signals that work properly because some games have horrible drivers, I'm telling you. If you want to, look at my comment. Update: Okay, thanks for the respond, I like your game.",
            "This game is good for wasting time and is rather relaxing. I do however have some negative points to share... 1)the controls are awful. I have the sensitivity turned almost down to nothing and it's still super sensitive. It makes it difficult to place furniture as one small knock and the item is out of line again. 2)the same tasks over and over again. 3)lack of furniture colour and details. 4)dirt and rubbish don't always load in and is hard to find.",
            "Absolutely love this game! It's so addicting and I've been playing nonstop for weeks, my only serious issue is The very last house, the most expensive one, I've reset the game 3 different times and every time as soon as I buy that one house and move to the property automatically I can no longer leave the screen of the yard. I can run around the yard, but I can't open my menu, my settings, can't use any of my tools, can't open the shop, or even any doors to actually enter the house.",
            "Pretty good overall. A good time killer. I have a few critiques, however. #1)Add an option to tear down and/or put up walls. I want to be able to move where my windows are, or put in a door from my bedroom to my bathroom. #2) Make a search option so you can find what you need to put in for a job. I kept finding myself looking over the catalogue over and over again trying to find something. Also maybe make subcategories for furniture so it's easier to find stuff. #3) Make dirt easier to find.",
            "Very good game, easy to use and simply explained. Spent many hours on this game. My only 2 minor concerns are, when it's dark it's near impossible to find all of the dark, a torch option would be good. And also another way of making more money would be good, it gets quite repetitive when working on a bigger house. Maybe daily rewards would be good, or more money as you progress. Other than that it's a great game"

The game also glitches and lags alot sometimes so much that I have to exit the app and lose the design, so I have to redo what I just did. This only happens after I have been playing for a little while and it usually glitches because of an ad. I also think that it could be more fun if yiu could design your own stuff and sell it or just to design it, so you can be more creative.",
            "Its an AMAZING game!!! I love it sooooo much. There is one problem. When I had been playing for quite a while I just had to repeat previous shirts, skirts, ect. Other than that its one of the most AWESOME games in the world. I hope you will add some more design's into the game.😘😘😘",
            "I've been playing this game for a long time . I maxed out all my upgrades and unlocked everything . I was playing for over 100 days then all of a sudden it started me again from DAY ONE.. Im super pissed because I never cared about all the stupid ads I just enjoyed the game then after all the time I've spent into this game for it to restart me to day one is a smack in the face...I will most likely be deleteing the app...VERY disappointing.",
            "Fun but needs more options. It would be great if you could make your own designs and have them for sale on the side, either auction style or in the shop. Also the way the ads are set up is not ideal for offline users. Unfair you can only get new things if you watch ads.",
            "This tie die game is so cool because like you just can do it like anything you want you have to make you close and everyone so cool like you can see all these world's there picture you have t-shirt pants skirts and all the people out there I think you should play this game is absolutely amazing OK bye see you guys later thank you for making this game I can wait to do it again😍😍😍"

But what makes me give this game four stars is because you have useful map and sprint and web and laser. I LIKE THIS GAME, TRY IT OUT!",
            "Hi !

You could also talk with friends, I say that it's a nice thing of them to put different servers in different areas, so it's better for some player's lag. The only problem I'd see is that black holes or any kind of hole spawning on your blob. Also, when you die from being really really big your screen still stays zoomed out. Great game!",

            "This game is so cool and fun but the problem is that we cannot unlock hairstyles, frocks and so many things. It just made annoyed and disappointed 😔. And when we try to unlock it, it asks for money. Please fix this and make it all free with no money. If fix this problem I WILL GIVE 5 STARS. But overall this game is good and I love it 😊.",
            "I absolutely HATE this game, it's just terrible, I haven't even had it for 1 hour before I deleted it. The game has an add every 10 seconds, literally. It is also very laggy, and when I tried to create the skirt it makes you pull the entire fabric over and in the end it looks like trash, so I would rate this a 0 star if I could, You are Welcome.",
            "Hello...Myself Nidhi... This is a very nice game....Only the problem is toooooo much of adds and if google add will come then we can't go again to the game...we should clear that game and then go again...Plz update and fix this problem...I dont need adds.... Is it online....Plz tell me.... If this add problem goes then it can be 4 or 5 stars.... Nice game then👌",
            "This game is interesting.. The only problem is that you can't unlock any of the accessories or designs and they seem to be locked forever.. There isn't even an option for unlocking them. I am at 1st position, and still I can't use that hair-dressing place. I have a suggestion, that it would be great, if there would have been an option that we can earn money in the game, and we could unlock those items, by spending that money. Because they ask for real money to unlock them. But overall 👍👍",
            "Its fabulous ! No much ads! Best part we can post our diy videos! Feel like i have a social media or youtube channel since i don't have it provide 98% like youtube similarity! Just pls for me add an option to comment the commenters bots! Then it will provide 100% youtube or any channel like bots says\"wow! Im on it!\" So there should be an option of writting back them too! No matter if they not reply but it will be my heartwinning! So pls add it! Overall i love it!but 4 stars cus we get bore early"

I have tried multiple times but entering my email is impossible. Edit - The above issue seems to be resolved. But now instead of entering email, it auto fetches email. Which is alright but the auto fetched email has a \"\\n\" before it. Which makes the email invalid. Will appreciate if this issue is resolved asap.",

This time while I was trying to do a fund transfer access, the app popped up an error msg to empty my payee list. Interestingly the list is decent. Still when I wanted to view it, the error message box just stayed on, letting me to do nothing but force close the app. Somehow this ICICI bank app seems always full of bugs.",

Devs, you did a good job of screwing things up. Way to go.",

It's easy to scan the photos, and even if you do tilt your phone, you can adjust the corners easily afterward. I've had a lot of success scanning hundreds of pictures already. Thanks for the great app!",
            "Well . . .! I am having a fair degree of success unlike some other reviews. I reduced glare by repositioning the photo relative to my light source. Have had this app for several months but only used it today for the first time on my new phone which has a good macro camera. I note scans are saved to phone, not external card, why not? Seems to overwrite my preferred camera save location so I have to jump through hoops to then transfer files to external card. Not so good 🙂",
            "The sreps the steps taken in order to Scan are more frustrating, than they should be. Holding the camera to the four corners of the photograph \" without tilting the camera\" allowed the while holding steady was frustrating if impossle with a smart phone. The resulting images were very poor. I tried just using the stocked functions that came with my androids camera and got easer shots with sharper images. I'm sorry guys, I feel generous giving it 2 stars. You're google you should be No. 1 !/",
            "First time use was okay. Then it began not get the scan. You have to move the phone to the four circles to complete the scan. An you only have about 30-40 seconds to do. Which is difficult since your not supposed to tilt the phone. Was unable to find any settings to increase the time frame or adjust the scan time. I am looking for another app that is easier to use.",
            "Terrible quality scans of photos. I got much better quality and higher resolution by just taking a picture of the old 4x6 photo with the camera on my phone. Great idea but poor execution. Hopefully it improves with time because usually I love stuff by Google."

All in all, get this app installed on your phone now, it'll be the best move you make all day... You can upload files to your Dropbox account directly from within the app also to Google Drive, plus you can also upload directly to your website from the app too. Plus there's 5GB free storage",
            "The app had always been my go to File Manager since I can remember. But, I get it!! I am not on Premium. The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable. But now, after every one or less that five actions and there comes a pop-up to buy the Premium and an ad thereafter? Will I get any work done on it surely? It's annoying and a waste of the users time!!"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

It will kick me out of the call completely, but discord is great overran. And it usually is ok with calls!",

The premium features are certainly worth it for anyone that spends a majority of their time within the app. However, all premium features are a monthly, or yearly payment. This is not very convenient for those who don't have a steady source of income. There should be an option to get minimum parts of premium for a single payment.",
            "Most of the times it doesn't work without headphones, however if I use it in another smartphone it does work. Something that I've experienced is that while you're in a call, it mutes or something like that, so I have to get out of the call and get in again, this \"mute\" happens while I'm not touching the phone and quitting the call is the only solution i've found",
            "Hello. Whenever I have discord open (browser or app), I completely lag out of games and my discord client, and it causes my web browser to stop responding. Without discord open, I never experience lag. Also, while in both browser or app, I'll suddenly be completely unable to speak in discord, but can hear everything that other people are saying. Has anyone else had this issue? I'm dying for a fix. I love discord, but it's been basically unusable for the last couple weeks."

If I could recommend one thing however, maybe implement a feature that would allow you to transfer worlds? I would be very curious as to what the world I spent hours making looks like.",
            "Very good game, good graphics. D game is cool cuz u can go to other dimension its so cool like this is d best game ever. But am rating it a 4 star bcuz in other mine crafts u can fly but this one u can't fix that and also make a setting to on/off d zombies and creepy things so u won't be scared when playing. If ur reading this download d game cuz its cool download u won't regret it.",
            "Excellent Game . But there are some problems- 1. The blocks are disappearing whenever i am visiting the snow fields 2. Today i have brought a empty milk bottle from the shop at day and went to get some milk from cow , but after going a distance from my house the game had automatically cutted ❌🚪 when i again start the game it is night ,I was in my house and there is no bottle with me ! Please let me know why it is happening🙏🙏",
            "Old Minecraft gamer- Needs auto filling in the chests so you don't get left with 5 things that can go in one stack, the bow is pretty useless even if you get amethyst bow... It doesn't shoot far enough and takes too long/awkward to draw. Other than that it's pretty awesome, although a world map would be very very useful along with having the compass."

            "I have no real issues with this game. Was going with 4 stars as it was very simple but I felt that didn't deserve losing a star. You shoot at trees and make rings while avoiding blocks. It's that simple. There are ads occasionally between stages or levels but lately I've been playing this on wifi so most of the ads are ones that I've told it to play to get more points, or extra points, or open chests. No idea how this game gets so addictive but I just keep coming back!",
            "I don't understand why I keep losing my save or current score if I close the game. shouldn't I be able to just pick up where I left off? also, with the shooter thingy, can't I just simply not use the new shooter that I won or something? this game would've been a lot more fun if these things are fixed",
            "I love this app it is absolutely amazing really fun to play and its entertain so I really like this App I know I've already said that but it's amazing it's perfect for kids and I give it a 5 Star but it sometime get hard that's what I am saying done by have online class",
            "This game is so great that I just can't stop playing it is not too easy nor is it far too difficult it is just perfect The ads are not that many and they are not that long than you expected You should install this app you know because it can too be really relaxing Both kids and parents can play this game and by the way I am only ten years old THANKS VERY MUCH FOR MAKING THIS GAME THANKS VERY VERY MUCH",

            "Challenging and great pictures. Very clear and interesting photography. Zoom is helpful and pictures don't blur when using it. I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",
            "Fun game, pictures are great. Would love if it told you where the pictures were taken. I would recommend this Find the Differences game",
            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "My experience with this app was really great. Its the perfect app for online study and calls. I just have one suggestion. Sometimes when we are asked a question which has a yes/no answer but its not always possible to unmute and answer so if its possible can we get a yes/no option for fast and direct response.",
            "Works very poor on mobile phone app when it comes to Teams calls. One can only listen and not speak well on a Teams call while using the mobile app. Also when searching for a message, it takes to the latest messages in the conversation and not that particular message being searched. Works on heavy data transfer.",
            "It is a really good app. I hope you continue to update it and make it better. But there is one problem. Since the starting of this week, there is a glitch for the teachers in the school that disallows them to join the meeting and sometimes even the app. I have given it Four stars cause it is very annoying and we students can't study properly. If this situation is fixed I will give it a five I swear.",
            "Great Online Meeting App.. But there is this thing that I would like to request the developers to add in Teams that there should be an option to delete an entire conversation with a specific person. We have to delete every single message to vanish the whole chat. Try to add this feature also to make it work more flexibly Overall nice application.. keep it up 👍🏻🤟🏻",
            "Teams is a good app. But there is a problem with the app. The app was fine but after the latest update, I can't join any meeting. I have a stable network. I tried signing out and signing in, but that also didn't work. Whenever I click on join button, it is showing that, \"Your call dropped and we couldn't reconnect\". So, I deleted it and installed an old problem free version. Edited : Now there is no problem after updating to the latest version. Thanks for solving the issues."

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

            "This is a good app for kids and need of learning of how life works and how pain fits yeah I know like why would we need a hospital game but it does teach kids not to do what the characters did in order not to get what the characters had it's really fun actually though it's it helps kids in need of learning L 😭",
            "This game is nice but in this game there are only three characters and they come with the same problem I am bored by doing the treatment of the same character with the same problem but still I like it some that is why I have given two stars",

            "Pay to play. Only lets you play with 2 dinosaurs before charging $3 to continue. If you have tons of money, go for it, because otherwise it is great for amusing kids. I like the game, but you deserve a one star rating for the deception. You know what you did.",
            "My son loves it. You get 2 dinosaurs for free, allowing you to trial whether your child likes it, and the remaining 6 for £2.99. My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."

            "Terrible. Awesome to kill time, but the forced ads after just about every single round is a real buzz kill, especially when its after dying instantly to an AI spawned with really fast 1-shot projectiles killing the instant you spawn in. Not only do they spawn with unbeatable set ups sometimes, they have up to 6,000HP is as high as I've noticed. I have 717HP, still a 1-shot with anything let alone this. Update brought literally changes whatsoever. Game is more frustration than entertainment.",
            "The description says you can play this online, you can't. You can turn airplane mode on in any match and keep playing. Even players named \"player 2726\" are bots. Never once have i seen lag either",
            "This game is so fun I can not stop playing it. It is the most finest game on google play I have ever played. I have never played a game this fun it is really fun super super super fun game I hope every body rated 5 stars I hope who ever looks at this if they don't have the game I hope they will downloaded it so I hope you give it 5 star please.",
            "Good game! However please take this review seriously...I have had it for quite some time now and, It definitely needs some improvements. When you are playing the game and you are near The spikes but not even close to them to where they should hurt you, they decrease your damage anyway That is something that needs to be fixed. Also, please bring back death Battle, I'm not even sure why you got rid of it in the first place It was actually a good feature to this game!",
            "Too easy,I beat it all within a week,there should be more leagues. But overall,a good game."

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players..

Update 10/15: daily bonus fails - check in same time every day - never get to day 7 award any longer. On top of incessant ads to just play, this is going on my 'only if I'm desperate & totally bored' pile. A real shame it has deteriorated to this.",

This posture is sometimes called \"Text Neck\", \"Scholar's Neck\", \"Wearsie Neck\", \"iHunch\" or \"Reading Neck.\" It is a posture problem that is caused by several factors including sleeping with the head elevated too high, extended use of computers and cellphones, lack of developed back muscle strength and lack of nutrients such as calcium. Neck pain when head forward and possible negative effects include tingling and numbness in the arms, headache or migraine, and a burning pain between the shoulder blades . Incorrect forward head posture can lead to chronic pain, numbness in the arms and hands, improper breathing and even pinched nerves. This is because for every inch your head extends forward, your neck has to support an additional 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of weight! How to tell if you have forward head posture ? Many people do not realize that they have poor neck posture, so you will want to test your posture to see if prolonged computer use, television viewing or incorrect sleeping positions have affected how you hold your head. Stretch and strengthen your muscles with specific exercises to reduce tension and other symptoms of poor neck posture. The misunderstanding of what the “head forward and up” direction means. The idea of this direction is to prevent the head pulling back and down, a very common and harmful habit causing compression and tension in the neck and throughout the body.

With OfficeSuite's Document app, this never happened, Word only went to editing. This was true for my personal desktop version too, went strait to editing with out any idication of issues. I am a Samsung DeX user and this also gives the best desktop experience. Just wish Aqua Mail was not seperate!",
            "I love the OfficeSuites! I was a hardcore user of Microsoft's Office for over 20 years. I started using OfficeSuites two years ago and I haven't looked back! I have used all the suites including Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Word, and Mail. They all run smoothly and without issue every time. I would like to see the Mail suite get more options like the option to mark the email \"important\" or \"urgent\" for sending and the ability to change the fonts inside the columns and rows, but these are not deal breakers for me. I am so glad I found OfficeSuites!",
            "i just bought a new Samsung tablet, installed this believing it wouldn't have bugs associated with old ones, bought a year's subscription and it is full of glitches. It will not create new documents. It gives me a blank screen, no way to type a number or letter, i can type letters but they do not show or store. So i have to create documents from my Word program and import them in. It boots me out of my document often while i access a web page so not multi-tasking.",
            "Just a rip off. You can't open any existing documents unless you pay for a subscription. So you pay it then you find that it doesn't come with the usual, everyday fonts, such as Arial, Times New Roman etc. These are part of the \"Extended Font Pack\" apparently 😮. If you want to use any documents that have these fonts (and you probably will, these are the standard, boring, day to day fonts) you'll have to pay another £13.99 for the font pack to get your documents to open properly.

            "Was a great game until the developers doubled the ad content. Not only that, but now the game is freezing after I make my final move to win the level, especially if I use a rainbow ball. If I use a rainbow ball in conjunction with another booster, regardless of what part of the level I'm at, the game freaks out and closes. When it does this, I have to redo the level again. If this continues, I will uninstall and reflect this in an update.",
            "I like this game because it is very relaxing. I also love the choices it gives you to work with. I personally love modern i think it is a cozy and cute inviorment to live in. I also love the matching game it gives you a way to get money. It is like a win win because you get to design and you get to match and overall i think this game is very good and that is why i gave it a five and if i had one complant it would be for a little bit more choices for the fashion sence. I will have my friends play",
            "Stupid & FULL OF ADS. Initially it was pretty good with not many ads. Now it's gotten so bad that there's not just 1 30+ second ad after every game, but 2 or even 3! It is beyond ridiculous how many ads you're forced to sit through in this game. On another note, it annoys me how the characters have been portrayed. The man looks strong and composed, hands folded across his chest. The woman, meanwhile, always has her mouth open, head bobbing, eyes squinting, looking like a silly child-like bimbo.",
            "I like this game because its direct. I mean other renovating games they ask us to earn stars to complete tasks. And those tasks include stupid ones like call a person, look under the bed, etc. But this only involves renovating and nothing else. No wasting time in listening to the people talking. I hate matching games but I'm putting up with it just because o this game is direct. I simply want a renovating game which doesn't have matching games, which doesn't have any stupid tasks and less talk",
            "I like this game because its quick. The graphics are good (not tiny little triangles squares and circles) Also you don't have to play loads of games to get furniture. The prices are pretty reasonable.so you get through rooms quicker"

            "Interesting game, graphics and sound good but, inability to move to the next stage though I was qualified, by winning in the previous stage and also investing the needed amount, is a put off... So please I hope you would work on it ASAP. Then I will give 5 stars",
            "Well the game is petty good but when i get a wide open 90% it misses and i cant stand that and when you go for a dunk it automatically just like looks like you're doing a layup but like why does it have to be in slow motion and when I go to unlock character I mean a new ball it just new ball action or or closed it just says new ball a lot and then he doesn't even show nothing like the game and then I'll give you a 5-star rating because this game should be like NBA 2K 20",
            "This is great, but I don't like the graphics of this game ,I'm dizzy by it's movements and the worst of all even I'm gonna dunk,shoot in 3 it won't shoot please fix it. So for now I'm giving it a 3. Until you fix it.",
            "The game is good and enjoyable but when ever I want to pass I will send it to my men but it will go to the other team please fix it but it is a good game i am sure that people will like it"

I honestly dont mind the ads, most of the time they're just skip able pictures unlike other apps with 30 second non-skip able clips. Thank you for making this app! 💝",
            "Ok at first but then I couldn't even choose a picture to erase the backround from. Im trying to renstall it. It didn't work. About a month later I reinstall it and after another 15 uses the same thing happened. I have to keep reinstalling it because when I choose the file it closes every one in a while . But it gets another star from last time I used it.",
            "Background Eraser is a great app! if you use the auto setting while erasing you can very easily erase the backround of a photo. but there is a downside, for some reason the adds that pop up are too big and I can't click off them, and the only way is to get off the add, is to close the app and restart. Is there anyway to fix this?",
            "Its really good! I love how its really easy and has the right tools for me,( im sorry if i dont spell right its my broken keybored) but theres one problem, when im done removing the background for a video, it just kicks me out. And also the ads, there are to many, ( sorry if im annoying) but i love ghe app so far! Keep up to work! :3",
            "Its good but there is to many ads,i would give it a 4 but theres way to many ads please fix the ads problem,but if it doesnt i might have to give it a 2 or a 1 if this gets better i will give it a 5 or either a 4 star that is all,but other than that its nice ..just please fix it"

Horny sounding and looking animated girls narrate the game progress. Whatever floats one's boat...",

After deducting the above amount, it simply says it cannot be done due to some kind of boundries.
