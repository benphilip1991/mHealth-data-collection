It will help you decide whether to go for further tests and discussing the implications with your GP or hospital doctor. It is possible that prostate cancer will not be found even if you have an elevated PSA. However, it may be present even if your PSA level is low.\r\n\r\nIf you have doubts or questions about your health, you should always contact your GP or urologist. This is particularly important if you have questions which arise from the use of one or more of the prostate cancer risk calculators.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the Indonesian Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (IPCRC) cannot be 100% accurate at predicting the presence or absence of prostate cancer. It is designed to help calculate your risk, not give a definitive diagnosis.

It will help you decide whether to go for further tests and discussing the implications with your GP or hospital doctor. It is possible that prostate cancer will not be found even if you have an elevated PSA. However, it may be present even if your PSA level is low.<br><br>If you have doubts or questions about your health, you should always contact your GP or urologist. This is particularly important if you have questions which arise from the use of one or more of the prostate cancer risk calculators.<br><br>Please be aware that the Indonesian Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (IPCRC) cannot be 100% accurate at predicting the presence or absence of prostate cancer.

The PSA test is used primarily to screen for prostate cancer. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. \"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\" will enable urologist to calculate PSA density (PSAD), PSA doubling time (PSADT), and PSA age volume (PSA-AV).\r\n\r\nThere are several features of \"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\", namely:\r\n🔸 Simple and very easy to use app for urologist.\r\n🔸 Precise calculation of PSA density, doubling time, and age volume.\r\n🔸 Useful for management of prostate cancer patient.\r\n🔸 It is totally free. Download now!\r\n\r\nScreening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) alone leads to unnecessary biopsy and overdiagnosis. PSA density is easily accessible. PSA density was calculated by dividing serum PSA concentration by gland volume. Using a PSA density cutoff of 0.15 as recommended in the literature enhanced specificity but at the cost of missing half of the tumors.\r\n\r\nPSA doubling time (PSADT) has been studied as a survival measure in prostate cancer. PSA doubling time, or the change in PSA level over time, has emerged as a useful predictive marker for assessing disease outcome in prostate cancer. PSA doubling time can be an indicator of biochemical and clinical progression of prostate cancer. This \"Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer\" app predicts the changes in PSA levels over time.\r\n\r\nThe PSA-age volume (PSA-AV) score was calculated by multiplying the age and prostate volume and then dividing the total by the prebiopsy PSA level. A PSA-AV score less than 700 had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 15%, respectively to predict prostate cancer. The PSA-AV score was more sensitive in younger patients and in patients with a small prostate volume.",

PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. &quot;Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer&quot; will enable urologist to calculate PSA density (PSAD), PSA doubling time (PSADT), and PSA age volume (PSA-AV).<br><br>There are several features of &quot;Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer&quot;, namely:<br>🔸 Simple and very easy to use app for urologist.<br>🔸 Precise calculation of PSA density, doubling time, and age volume.<br>🔸 Useful for management of prostate cancer patient.<br>🔸 It is totally free. Download now!<br><br>Screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) alone leads to unnecessary biopsy and overdiagnosis. PSA density is easily accessible. PSA density was calculated by dividing serum PSA concentration by gland volume. Using a PSA density cutoff of 0.15 as recommended in the literature enhanced specificity but at the cost of missing half of the tumors.<br><br>PSA doubling time (PSADT) has been studied as a survival measure in prostate cancer. PSA doubling time, or the change in PSA level over time, has emerged as a useful predictive marker for assessing disease outcome in prostate cancer. PSA doubling time can be an indicator of biochemical and clinical progression of prostate cancer. This &quot;Urology PSA Calculator Pro - Prostate Cancer&quot; app predicts the changes in PSA levels over time.<br><br>The PSA-age volume (PSA-AV) score was calculated by multiplying the age and prostate volume and then dividing the total by the prebiopsy PSA level. A PSA-AV score less than 700 had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 15%, respectively to predict prostate cancer. The PSA-AV score was more sensitive in younger patients and in patients with a small prostate volume.",

The evaluations presented represent our best efforts to conveniently assess cancer risk. However, as significant controversy and widely different study results can persist around the impact of even a single variable in a strictly selected population, this is based on a large number of assumptions, extrapolations and estimates.

        "description": "A prostate infection (prostatitis) occurs when your prostate and the surrounding area become inflamed. The prostate is about the size of a walnut. It’s located between the bladder and the base of the penis. The tube that moves urine from the bladder to the penis (urethra) runs through the center of your prostate. The urethra also moves semen from the sex glands to the penis.\r\n\r\nSeveral types of infections can affect the prostate. Some men with prostatitis experience no symptoms at all, while others report many, including intense pain.\r\n\r\nTypes of prostatitis\r\n\r\nAcute bacterial: This type is the least common and lasts a short time. It can also be life-threatening if left untreated. This is the easiest type of prostatitis to diagnose.\r\n\r\nChronic bacterial: Symptoms are less intense and develop over several years. It’s more likely to affect young and middle-aged men and cause recurring urinary tract infections (UTIs).\r\n\r\nChronic prostatitis, or chronic pelvic pain syndrome: This condition causes pain and discomfort around the groin and pelvic area. It can affect men of all ages.\r\n\r\nAsymptomatic inflammatory : The prostate is inflamed but there are no symptoms. It’s usually discovered when a doctor is diagnosing another problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer : How to Get Rid of Prostatitis - Prostate Treatment App is for informational and education purposes only and are not a substitute for professional medical or health advice, examination, diagnosis, or treatment.

The main function of the prostate is the secretion (fluid) production, which is part of the sperm and dilutes it to ensure normal sperm motility.\r\n\r\nProstatitis as a disease is most often encountered in the practice of a urologist. It can occur suddenly (acutely) or gradually, and its manifestations are constant and prolonged (chronic). The chronic form is much more common than acute.\r\n\r\nVery often, pathological conditions of the prostate gland, such as cancer or benign hyperplasia, are detected in elderly patients.

            "Honestly, this app is more of a discouragement to keep going than anything else. There multiple key features missing that are available on the site and not on the app. you cannot post your moves to facebook when you make them (thus you're just posting to no one/your mospace when you do your move). You can take a picture, but you cannot save it, or post it, or do anything with it. If you tap randomly on your screen though, you might be able to get the app to save the picture to your camera roll. The time to post moves is in 24-hr format for no apparent reason, it defaults to KM and does not save your choice in the future. There are a slew of other issues too. Most of all, it really sucks that you cannot post your moves to FB as that, personally, would be my main way of spreading the word about the cause.",

While upgrading my operating system may not be an option, hopefully by MOvember 2019 I will have upgraded to a new phone altogether :-{",
            "This app is rubbish, it is hard to use, no clear way to save photos (for some reason I can't save photos I have posted to my page...) I can't get a link to my page anywhere on the app. This really needs some serious work! Here is hoping people don't use it as an excuse not to raise funds for this awesome cause. Luckily I am just going to the web page on my phone.",

It recognizes me via FB log in as well as welcoming me back using email instead but either way, it absolutely will Not let me log in (Android) so it's pointless either way I try. :( I've used this app every year for years but remove it between uses and have never encountered this serious of a problem with it before now."

Men’s App muestra contenidos de interés para todos los grupos de edad. Obviamente, las enfermedades de transmisión sexual preocupan más frecuentemente a varones jóvenes, y el cáncer de próstata a varones más maduros, pero todos los temas son de interés general. ¡Nunca está de más aprender!\r\n\r\nTradicionalmente las mujeres siempre han sido conscientes de la necesidad de revisiones ginecológicas desde una edad temprana ¡pero no los hombres! Es cierto que el riesgo de cáncer de útero para las mujeres comienza antes que el riesgo de cáncer de próstata para los hombres, por eso las revisiones urológicas no se recomiendan hasta la década de los 40. Pero, ¿son los varones conscientes de esto? Definitivamente no, los hombres están muy lejos de las mujeres en esta faceta.\r\n\r\nPor eso en Men’s App el objetivo del  Dr. Juan Pablo Burgués es concienciar y divulgar información sobre problemas de salud que afectan a los hombres, con un lenguaje sencillo y entendible por cualquiera. También econtrarás algunas herramientas útiles:\r\n\r\n- Tienda de productos para el hombre, con artículos cuidadosamente seleccionados por su calidad y su garantía de compra segura.\r\n- Obtén la opinión de un experto.\r\n- Test de autoevaluación sobre alcoholismo.\r\n- Cuestionario de síntomas prostáticos.\r\n- Haz un seguimiento de tu PSA.\r\n- Calculadora de IMC.\r\n- Deja de fumar.\r\n- Sexo seguro.\r\n\r\nPuedes usar Men’s App como una herramienta para entender, aprender, prevenir o seguir recomendaciones, pero si tienes un problema nunca debe sustituir a la consulta con tu médico.\r\n\r\nLa actividad de Men’s App consiste en tips cortos de salud del hombre en www.mens-app.es, en las redes sociales (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin) y en la app. Además, cada cierto tiempo el Dr. Burgués desarrolla un nuevo tema en profundidad que queda para su lectura off-line en la pestaña \"Temas\" de la app. Estos son algunos de los problemas de salud del hombre que se tratan en Men’s App:\r\n\r\n– Hiperplasia benigna de próstata\r\n– Déficit de testosterona\r\n– Impotencia\r\n– Infertilidad\r\n– Eyaculación precoz\r\n– Cáncer de próstata\r\n– Enfermedades de transmisión sexual\r\n– Cáncer de testículo\r\n\r\n¡Únete a Men’s App!

The CPC Risk Calculator has been validated in two large institutional cohorts from Denmark and USA.\r\n\r\nThe dataset is based on 3.746 men who were followed for 20 years after surgery for prostate cancer without receiving any adjuvant treatment at Copenhagen Prostate Cancer Center, Denmark and Stanford Urology, CA, USA.

Initial analyses were performed using time between date of surgery and whatever came first biochemical recurrence (outcome of interest) or death without biochemical recurrence (competing risk). Patients without biochemical recurrence were right-censored at latest follow-up. Two multiple cause-specific Cox proportional hazard regression models, one for biochemical recurrence and one for death without recurrence were combined into estimates of the absolute risks of biochemical recurrence. The analyses include preoperative PSA, pT-category, surgical margin status, and radical prostatectomy Gleason score.

For instance, every man should know that prostate cancer is one of the most common prostate problems out there. It tops the list of cancers that afflict men, happening in nearly as many men, roughly speaking, as breast cancer in women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProstate cancer doesn’t get the press that breast cancer does, however, probably because most men would rather not speak about what’s happening down there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second thing most men don’t, but should know is exactly what that prostate is. A prostate is actually part of a man’s sexual organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocated just below the bladder in a man, wrapped around the urethra, the prostate is about the size of a walnut. Its main job in the birds-and-bees scheme of things is to add fluid to your sperm during ejaculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd most of the time, men don’t even realize they have a prostate because it’s a hidden internal organ, but all men find out quickly what and where their prostate is when they suffer a common prostate problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor instance, all men should know that prostate issues aren’t just for older men. Men under 50 can get prostatitis, or an extremely painful infection of their prostate. This is a swelling of the prostate that can cause fever, a burning sensation during urination, and fatigue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd all men over 50 should be aware of their number one most common prostate problem, which is an enlarged prostate, or benign prostatic hypertrophy. This benign, or nonfatal condition, is actually far more common in older men than prostate cancer, which should give some relief to older men when they know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMen should all be aware of the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, such as leaking and dribbling during urination, a weak urine stream, trouble getting started with urination, and even small amounts of blood in the urine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd though benign prostatic hypertrophy is more common than prostate cancer, men should be aware that the two can go hand in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s not always the case, and many men with an enlarged prostate will never develop into cancer. But it’s good to keep your eyes out for both, because they can have similar symptoms.",

This benign, or nonfatal condition, is actually far more common in older men than prostate cancer, which should give some relief to older men when they know it.<br><br><br><br>Men should all be aware of the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, such as leaking and dribbling during urination, a weak urine stream, trouble getting started with urination, and even small amounts of blood in the urine.<br><br><br><br>And though benign prostatic hypertrophy is more common than prostate cancer, men should be aware that the two can go hand in hand.<br><br><br><br>It’s not always the case, and many men with an enlarged prostate will never develop into cancer. But it’s good to keep your eyes out for both, because they can have similar symptoms.",

        "description": "How to Do Kegel Exercises for Men\r\nIf you do Kegel exercises on a regular basis, then you can substantially strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. By having strong pelvic floor muscles, you may be able to reduce urinary and bowel incontinence and improve your sexual health.[1] Before you begin practicing the exercises regularly, you must learn how to do them correctly. If you are unsure, then contact your doctor. Like any exercise, start out slowly and gradually increase your stamina over time.Do Kegel exercises before receiving treatment for prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nHow to Do Pelvic Floor Exercises\r\nThe pelvic floor is a group of muscles--in both men and women--that support your spine, help control your bladder, and help with sexual functions. By identifying your pelvic floor, performing Kegels (a popular pelvic floor exercise), and practicing other pelvic floor exercises, you can rehabilitate these muscles. In time, you can gain the benefits of a strong pelvic floor, including reduced urinary incontinence, less back pain, more control of your core, and better sex.\r\n\r\nHow to Do Kegel Exercises for Women\r\nKegel exercises can improve your sex life and help with pelvic floor problems, including urinary and fecal incontinence. The key is to get in the habit of doing them every day so you start to see results.\r\n\r\nKegel Exercise Description and Routines\r\nBasic Kegel Exercise Descriptions\r\nBeginner Kegel Exercise Routine\r\nIntermediate Kegel Exercise Routine\r\n\r\nHow to Do Reverse Kegels\r\nKegels are well known for their ability to tighten the pelvic floor, reduce incontinence, improve sexual enjoyment, and help with childbirth. Reverse kegels can also help with these goals. Each time you do a reverse kegel, you relax, lengthen, and stretch the pelvic floor, which may help to relieve pain or tension in the area. Men and women can perform reverse kegels, and you can do them anywhere without any special equipment!\r\n\r\nHow to Do Kegel Exercises for Pregnant Women\r\nKegel exercises, like other exercises, help strengthen muscles. The muscles that are strengthened by the Kegel exercises are located in the lower section of the pelvic region and are responsible for holding the pelvic organs in place as well as controlling the flow of urine from the body.[1] Both of these are important for pregnant women. Due to the increased size of the uterus and the weight of the growing baby, this area of the body is under stress, which can sometimes lead to bladder leakage and other issues, To do Kegel exercises, you will need to find the muscles and then practice engaging them.\r\n\r\nHow to Treat and Prevent Incontinence with Kegel Exercises\r\nKegel exercises can strengthen a woman's pelvic muscles and ligaments. For best results, more than three sets of Kegel exercises should be done every day.\r\n\r\nHow to Do PC Muscle Exercises\r\nThe pubococcygeus (PC) muscle is the muscle that stretches from your pubic bone to the bottom of your spine. Strengthening the pubococcygeus (PC) muscle can help both sexes treat urinary and fecal incontinence, as well. PC muscle exercises are easy daily exercises that will help strengthen your PC muscle.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises: A how-to guide for women\r\nHere's a step-by-step guide to doing Kegel exercises correctly.\r\n\r\nKegel exercises for men: Understand the benefits\r\nKegel exercises for men can help improve bladder control \r\n\r\nKegel exercises (also called “pelvic floor exercises”) strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.\r\n\r\nWhat are Kegel exercises?\r\nWhy do Kegel exercises?\r\nFinding the pelvic floor muscles in women\r\nFinding the pelvic floor muscles in men\r\nGoals and benefits of Kegel exercises\r\nHOW KEGEL EXERCISES WORK\r\nHOW TO DO KEGEL EXERCISES - A STEP BY STEP GUIDE\r\nSIGNS OF PELVIC FLOOR STRENGTH IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nI will be so gratefull if you download this app and give it 5 star and share it with your family and friends. via rrnshams@gmail.com\r\nThank you.",

            "Great app! You should add the a way to count your workouts for that day. That way I can try and beat the workout count every day, or least figure out how many workouts is best to do. I really love this app, incredibly well designed and effective. Also very user-friendly",
            "Absolutely love the App. So easy to use and so much more fun than doing it on my own. I had lots of fun exercising with different voices all the other languages too! But the English one is the most natural, less robotic and even a bit naughty, especially when he says 'final squeeze ', love it!",
            "I started trying kegels due to semen retention practice. I am realising that the only way to do this consistently is to separate ejacultion and orgasm. I heard kegels help alot so tried to do them but wasn't consistent as I had no programme to follow. This app is great as it gives you daily exercises to do. I'm starting to feel a difference down there! 😉",
            "So, Ive been experiencing some bladder control issues recently and it was suggested to me I try kegals. This was the first app I came across and I'm glad I did. 2 weeks of daily use and I'm out of bladder leak undies. 10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend.",
            "I needed an app that could remind me daily to do Kegel after the birth of my son and this is it!! I used it while nursing him and it takes no effort! The level 1 would definitely work for beginner and it seems that it goes gradually.. Looking forward to see how the next levels go.."

I only wanted the free version. I am not sure it let me. Will be very upset if I am charged anything after stating I didn't want to renew or charged.!! Not sure yet as they have not confirmed!!!",
            "The app is good. It also works like a booster and cleaner. My games also running fast after using this app. It gives both protection and efficiency to my phone . But the disadvantage is it uses lot of RAM! . I think my game would run more faster if this app use less ram. This app take nearly 500 mb of ram. Even though I love this app 👍👍👍👍 . I have been using this app for years and also recommend to anyone who thinks that their phone is feeling unsafe . It is useful",
            "Great app with no problems in security. I am using the app for free but also it works very very.... great.my phone was lagging before and it solved my problems and i hope the app will always be like this with full security.(\"i dont know what phone do anyone will have but this will work on your phone\"---for them who are searching for antivirus)",
            "I got the upgrade seems great. The only thing I'm not happy with is the VPN doesn't start manually. I use same network. It's a pain to remember to have to turn it on. Thank you for the link. 1 more thing in menu at bottom in red it says get VPN. So I clicked it took me to a VPN Avast. Am I safe with the VPN included with my AVAST? 5 ⭐ The VPN should start automatically when I'm home on the same network at all times, not using mobile data.",
            "The home page can be a little confusing or overwhelming at first. Especially for a New user like me, who's NOT good at All with technology!!🤣 But I'm getting much more familiar with it, by the day! And, I'm just So relieved to know... that I Do have more protection of my devices and my personal info!! TY 😁"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I love this game. You have a pay to win option, but you can still win without paying, and I like that. You can defeat a vastly superior enemy with tactics, perfect naval landing game. Graphics could be better, but who cares about graphics when you're watching a million riflemen storm the beaches? Great game. It's fair, too. No such thing as chance in the battles, it's all about the tactics (mostly).",
            "Awesome game! I'm really into the strategic games and that's what this is. Only thing I dont really like is you can only upgrade one building or item at a time, which makes maxing out and upgrading things really slow and hard. Heroes are fantastic and have different powers you can use in battle and there are very unique soldiers you can use, too! Overall fantastic game, really, I cant put my phone down when I get on. Super awesome!",
            "It's been a fun game since its release and developers try to keep you wanting more. Like any software product they have their fair share of updates. Sometimes they hit it and works fantastic and others that don't. Where I think they miss completely is rewarding players. An example would be to login everyday you get extra diamonds. Something along those lines. Other games do it and some even get outstanding press for it.",
            "This game could do way better. Training troops takes too long, the matchmaking is a joke and you only have one builder, you could buy another temporarily at least give us an option to buy another builder for gems permanently and not temporarily and the for the people who don't want to use money this game is going to take too long and it will take too much of your time",
            "Enjoy playing the game. However it takes way to long to upgrade. Had played a few years ago and was maxed on about every thg ing but did not have game saved and I pad too a dive. So am starting all over. It will take a long time to get back to where I was but I am taking moving up levels at a slower pace. But it takes a long time to upgrade troops etc."

            "The problem where everytime I open the app I can't login for the first time. I click it again in order to get me in. I reinstall the updated version of the app, then the problem was resolved. I choose 3 stars because I'm observing the behavior of the app. I am looking forward someday that I'll rate this app at the highest rate possible, if the stability is okey. Thanks, I hope I can help others that are experiencing just like mine.",
            "Of all the many different antivirus apps I trust Kaspersky the most I have never had my computer get infected using them. Currently I'm only running the free one and I'm using it on my phone and my computer both desktop and laptop I will be upgrading soon I had the full paid for but finances were tight and I had to cancel that and go with free and it is doing an awesome job thank you so much",
            "Fingerprint app-lock fails on Galaxy S20. Went through Kaspersky support, used the debug version, sent them the results. Then they gave me another version to try that also failed. Now they say they're working with Samsung to sort this out. So I put a 3 star review up describing the problem. Now I get a review response to contact support to investigate the problem... That's poor, someone hasn't checked. Downgraded to 2 stars. 6 months on, fingerprint app-lock still isn't working.",
            "Bought premium for an year (Sept 2020 to Sept 2021) but it won't show up even when I had it on my Google play subscription. Edit: I contacted the support team and the solved it within a matter of hours. I'm really glad and grateful for the services and dedication towards the customer. Thank you!",
            "Really great protection that makes me feel safe! I do have two complaints which is why I deducted two stars. For one, there is a lack of variety for Internet security - why is Firefox not on this list? This I can learn to deal with but I much prefer to use Firefox. The second issue is with the app locker service - it makes me feel really secure, but every time I unlock, as soon as I start scrolling or if a new tab shows up within the app, I'm forced to re-authenticate. It's really not usable."

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

            "I love this game and have been playing pretty much since it came out,however I have some concerns,I have gotten the short end on some plays,for example birds will sometimes go away sooner than they should and have lost out on points,jewels,etc,one of my biggest issues is items landing on pigs without popping them,this happens ALOT,and certain levels you get 3 feathers etc.and just weird numbers,rewards should be more, but do love game,look forward to improvements.",
            "Normally a great game but the levels (500 or more) are all ki generated and then its not really fun anymore. You loose in a game, try it again and it's built totally different than before. It's like you're playing the same level every 20 levels again and that really takes the fun, sadly :/",
            "Very nice game. Some individual free hats are stray&poisonous. Like Park Ranger Hat(update in sept).U willn't get hats for all birds, remaininng hats U have to buy frm hat shop at very higher cost( black gems). This hat set will not rise power of Ur sungshot by 3, only by 1 & birds power by 1. Now 'Calavara' hat started. (See hat shop). Also rewards are poisonous. After playing, U search for rewards, but in vail. U just download & play. I have 2 games in my mob, so 2 five stars. TC Suresh.",
            "Way way way too many updates. And every update is a requirement to play the game. That is a lot of bandwidth you force people to use, instead of a simple patch. So you either wait for an opportunity to use wifi, or eat the data usage. Besides that, the game is fun to play, but there are now way too many facets to it. You can opt not to play all of it, which is nice, but the interface is extremely cluttered now.",
            "This game is actually really fun and addictive. But the fact that to really progress you have to spend money is a drawback. Hats to strengthen the slingshot/birds cost black pearls which are won mostly in small increments. Gems are the same, if you want to continue in any element of the game you have to pay. Continue once 60 gems, twice 180. You get 5 lives, run out? Pay gems. Stamps? Can't even win in game have to buy. Other than that, it's fun."

            "Loved the game from I started to play it. It has taught me patience, respect for others, base designing, to reach your goal which is Masters League im at 3045 trying to get to 3200. This game has just been a big impact in my life. I absolutely love the hero skins. In my opinion Clockwise Queen, P.E.K.K.A King and the Pirate Warden. Now let me talk about what I think you need to improve on is the Builder Base I honestly think that you guys need to look at that side more. In my opinion the walls are way to expensive it takes to long for me to upgrade them. Now lets talk about the normal side now. I think you need to work on people getting attacked and losing a lot of trophies I used to lose 20 to 35 trophies back when I was a TH9 and I couldnt reach Masters League so I decided to upgrade mt TH and I loe 10 to 20 trophies now because I found an anti 1 star. But besides that I love the fact that this game is so old and its not dying and hopefully will not. But thats it for me. GOOD LUCK!!!",
            "One of the greatest games of all time. Clash of Clans was a childhood favorite of mine. Combining amazing gameplay with the ease of playing in your phone, anywhere and anytime, Clash of Clans is the lovechild of some of the best classic CRPG and RTS games. Clash of Clans has an addictive nature, and the game runs flawlessly on almost any device. Battles are exciting and intense, base building is very fun and limitless. You can play the game any way you want - there are no limitations. 5/5.",
            "The game is still Good, no complaints about it. But i do have a suggestion, its about the clan. Why not add a section where we can see who is active in the clan even if were not in game friends. Cuz it'd be a hassle if everyone would have to add everyone that ever joined the clan, which would be kinda confusing i think. Especially for the Lead, and coleads managing the Clan. Cuz in our case, not everyone uses the clan chat when they should. So i was hoping you could possibly consider this?",
            "Sucks !!! After the last update it sucks !!! All my training time for troops is gone back to the time when I unlocked them for example I've upgraded my dragons to the level where they took 3 minutes to train after the update they're taking 3 minutes !! And it's not only the dragons and also not the only bug !! It has ruined the total experience !! And also it's Clan war league going on !! Supercell what have you done !!😒😡 And yeah your in game help and support center sucks even more !😡 Fix it",
            "Love the game came back after 2.5 years and a lot has changed since then. New things have been introduced like th12 and th13 new troops. Graphics are also improved. 4 star because me and my friends are having a glitch since our native language is not english we type in hindi using english alphabet and the game converts in astriks like ****. this pls fix it its really annoying. Rest is fine . Thank you."

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

This inbalance forces the player to have to develop specific characters. To do so quickly requires paying to make this happen. There was always a pay to play aspect but you could get bu without paying, but that is becoming harder with each OP'd character created.",

            "So many people say that it's way too hard to get brawlers. I think that this game is perfect and it is nicely balanced (except for amber). If people are getting brawlers once a week, then it won't be as exciting when you get a new one. I have 15k trophies and 39 brawlers. That is kinda low for my level, but other than the fact that I want a new brawler, this game is 5 stars.",
            "Lots of different and interesting characters, hampered by an unbelievably toxic community. I have had countless matches where people are sitting in the spawn, doing nothing for the entire game. Or they gather up a bunch of gems and sprint into the enemy base to hand them over. There is no way to report them, so they just keep getting away with it. And that is if you don't get matched up with your level 1 and 2 team against some level 8 opponents, who can one-shot-kill you every single time.",
            "Honestly I'd give them 5 stars but the internet connection is SO BAD!!! (At least not all the time) even when I'm in a room with full connection it still lags like crazy and I'm unable to play. However everything else is AMAZING I would definitely recommend it, it has amazing updates every month and a cool youtube channel where we can follow their development the only thing that is bothersome and prevents me from giving them a 5 stars is the lag of course.",
            "The game itself is good but the \"Brawl-o-ween\" skin challenge skin should be changed to unlimited tries because sometimes when you loose its not your fault that you loose. Also, if you handing out a free skin that \"everybody can get\" why have the 4 looses and your out? It kind of defeats the purpose of handing out the skin in the first place. The fact that im not able to get the skin is making me want to uninstall it.",
            "POOR MATCHMAKING. (Example: Teammates with low power level vs Enemies with Level 10 power level). SHOULD ADD REPORT SYSTEM. I've encountered many teammate in brawl ball just to throw the game. (They take the ball and shoot it at our goal, that would make the enemy win.) Do the developers know hoe frustating that is? AND! they will be your teammates again in the next play!! 🤬 Please don't just add more events or skins. Please add some features that would make the game better."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

        "description": "You've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\nYou've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\n\r\n1. Don't use tobacco\r\nUsing any type of tobacco puts you on a collision course with cancer. Smoking has been linked to various types of cancer — including cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, larynx, pancreas, bladder, cervix and kidney. Chewing tobacco has been linked to cancer of the oral cavity and pancreas. Even if you don't use tobacco, exposure to secondhand smoke might increase your risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAvoiding tobacco — or deciding to stop using it — is an important part of cancer prevention. If you need help quitting tobacco, ask your doctor about stop-smoking products and other strategies for quitting.\r\n\r\n2. Eat a healthy diet\r\nAlthough making healthy selections at the grocery store and at mealtime can't guarantee cancer prevention, it might reduce your risk. Consider these guidelines:\r\n\r\nEat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Base your diet on fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant sources — such as whole grains and beans.\r\nAvoid obesity. Eat lighter and leaner by choosing fewer high-calorie foods, including refined sugars and fat from animal sources.\r\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, do so only in moderation The risk of various types of cancer — including cancer of the breast, colon, lung, kidney, and liver — increases with the amount of alcohol you drink and the length of time you've been drinking regularly.\r\nLimit processed meats. A report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, concluded that eating large amounts of processed meat can slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancer.\r\nIn addition, women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts might have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active\r\nMaintaining a healthy weight might lower the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon, and kidney.\r\n\r\nPhysical activity counts, too. In addition to helping you control your weight, physical activity on its own might lower the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.\r\n\r\nAdults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits. But for substantial health benefits, strive to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. You can also do a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine — and if you can do more, even better.\r\n\r\nKeywords:-\r\n\r\n1. Cancer\r\n2. Medical\r\n3.

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "This update will give you seizures. I have no idea what you are thinking Response: when running. The screen appears to be twitching more than the character running. Made my eyes water up , I can't play anymore : good luck 🤗 And to all future players. If you see VGA:top or any other. Just leave. I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",
            "Love the game can't seem to put it down. No problems with my iPhone! The graphics on this game is amazing its clear not blurry like those othe war games. You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

            "I like this app, it's the best scanner and really easy to organise. I didn't give full stars because there isn't an option to edit the name, or edit the documents. Like scan a few more, or delete a few once you have saved it onto the device. If I make a mistake I have to rescan everything. Nonetheless, I am still using this app because there are no ads and it's a quality scanner!",
            "It's a nice app, especially if you have an outlook account. When you save it, it saves directly to your account after you log in once, and you can also choose what to save it as (pdf, jpeg, etc. . .). The only thing is, if you have bad lighting, sometimes the scanner won't pick up the edges of your paper. Which is a given for any scanner, but if you're in a rush it can cost you time. It doesn't have pop up ads like some other scanners I've used so that's also a plus.",
            "This is an amzing app. If we click a photo for scanning from any angle, it automatically makes the photo clear and straight. I could have given 5 stars to this app, if there could be one more feature in it. Today I had to scan the images of my test paper and by mistake, I forgot one page to scan. So I scanned it at the last thinking that *there will be an option to reorder the pages in a correct format*. But I wasnt able to reorder. Please add page reordering feature in this app. Thank you.😊",

Works just fine and captures the document from whichever angle I click. Only one thing, today I forgot to rename the file before saving it. And then I couldn't find any option to rename it. So I had to click the pictures of the pages again. If there is a renaming option, please help me find it but if not, that's an improvement you must make."

No option to program it not to block those numbers so I have to turn the blocking off. Also everything prompts you to go premium...I thought the last uncarrier move said this would be free? Now it just feels like a additional ploy to get money out of us...sneaky.",
            "It's been a long time coming for this app and finally its here Thank you T-mobile I no longer have to go through phone call after phone call. I would get more phone calls from scammers more than my own personal calls on a daily I never wanted to answer my phone cause I just knew it was probably a scam of some sort I can't explain how annoying that is. So thank you so very much T-mobile....",
            "**Response to developer: Scam block is already turned on, it just doesn't work very well. Make the app better instead of blaming your customers please.** Doesn't block very many calls, but has blocked calls from contacts. That can be fixed by adding them to favorites, but it's still annoying. I liked it better when the TMobile system would say \"scam likely\" which seems to have been discontinued after this app launched. It sounds good but doesn't work very well.",
            "Useless, reroutes spam callers to voicemail. Basic app notifications are locked behind paywall. Just download Google Phone cause unlike this it's free, it works, and you can mark callers as spam from the phone app immediately, unlike this where you wait hours . App has a problem where voicemail calls and unknown numbers call don't appear, so you cannot mark them as spam. The entirety of this should be free for all T-Mobile customers. Better yet opensoure it, so people can fix it.",
            "At first this worked great. I wasn't getting any calls that ever said scam likely. Until the last few weeks I have been receiving four or five calls a day from a number that has the same area code and prefix as my number. I block the number, just to get another call from the same area code and prefix. Of course I don't answer. I block, they change the last four digits in their number and call again within 10 minutes."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "I don't know how people are giving this app one star!, I have had just ONE problem plus, I think it really works because I'm getting these spam messages and it's stopped the spam. I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",
            "It be happy to assist you with your background closure ,extended battery, help finding your loss of your product, phone 📱 or any other product you have been working on with anti theft protection 😉 😀",
            "This app is great with helping to clean files and monitoring apps using up your battery and/or memory. I have only had them for about a week now."

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

I don't care for the redesign, but it's not as much of an issue.",

It's a overall a great app otherwise I wouldn't pay for all the bells and whistles, however its missing a dark/black theme, if it had that it would be the perfect dictionary app 👌😎.

Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Some things I noticed + compared to CR:OB 1) Story. It's...mediocre at best. Pretty simple; guy comes in, steals candy, you gotta go get it and restore the place. CR has many originals. Take inspo.! 2) Gameplay. Almost exactly like CR's. Same mechanics and almost the exact same power ups. Even the jelly/candy collecting is the same. Some lag, you get hit once and you're done, jumping animation is a bit long. 3) Characters. Multiple characters to choose from like CR. Needs more variety.",
            "Very good game... like the other outfit 7 games, it is also interesting... just before I was playing the \"Talking Tom Friends\" and that game became boring after playing it during around 70 days.. therefore I installed this game as I know the talking games are very much simple and fresh minded... Continue your God blessing work.. 🧚🌼👼👼. My favourite character is angela because she runs smoothly and her look is overall very good. The music of the game is also perfect.The graphics is awesome.",
            "( who are reading this comment please read fully)i have many tom games ,because i like the grapics , the characters and they are sooo cute and concept are nice ,but in the tom hero dash it takes too much time . the game is soo nice but it takes lot of time to load . i posted this in tom hero dash also but no response so posting in this fun game. ok please check it . bye",
            "It is so cute wow the the graphics it is greatest game till now I loved it cutie. Thankyou so much for making it offline I love the fact that when if one player out than other player continue running I will definitely recommend it to my friends too. I was in search of such game these days I keep downloading games and after 1hr or so I delete them I am never satisfied with games but this game is so amazing. 😘🤩🤩"

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",

            "Fun and addicting game! I really dont like the first person camera view. I see more vehicle then anything else. I also noticed a glitch when taking a log, rock or car to a build or challenge circle. Sometimes it won't release the item in the circle. The turning controls, especially on the helicopters, could use some work too. But other then that! I love it! Needs more maps!",
            "Good game. With only 5 maps, unfortunately, need more maps to make this game more interesting. Wide terrain for each map, with so many mini games inside each of map. To bad we only get to hold 3 card slot, with so many out there to collect. Take too long to get another vehicle unless we paid, but all and all, this game make me want to play every time.",
            "This game is one of the best off road games and yes it looks better then you think too it has really good realistic sounds and lots of things to do and the truck you start out with is a some and sounds good it also has a realistic damage model on all the cars and all I can say is a game like this is hard to find on the play store it's like something you would get on a PC or game system",
            "Nice game, but it needs some simple additions such as adding some people to the game because I feel lonely in the game. Or I feel that it lacks some natural things, such as some animals, such as some birds. And make the weather in the game change with time. And something like day and night will make the game more beautiful. It misses some simple things, but those things will give more beauty to the game",
            "This games honestly got a lot packed into it for a free game and although the grinds do force you to become a grinding sloth it's still fairly enjoyable. no idea how I'm going to collect 300 let alone 2500 cards for a vehicle when there's at least 60 vehicles and you only get 5 or so cards for a vehicle at a time (and it takes 8hrs). would be worth it for a once off 6.99, even $12 purchase. Catch is, you're gonna have to cough up 6.99 every month if you want to try all the vehicles \"for free\""

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",

The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

Stopped working and never resumed. Customer support takes days to figure out anything. Sent me the wrong message about Kaspersky kid troubleshooting. Stear clear from this service, especially if you are in China.",
            "The VPN always turns itself off. I find myself always checking to see if it's on. So many times I've noticed that it's off and I get to play the \"how long has my data been un secured\" game. Definitely won't be renewing my subscription as this app isn't trustworthy. Such a shame, as I've been using Kaspersky for years.",
            "I've been using this app for a while with no problems on my S9 Plus, recently I updated to the Note 20 and it's not working on the Note 20 but still working on the S9 Plus. It says it has connected to said location but I still cannot access blocked content from the country I am in using my Note 20. Please fix this problem.",
            "If you are paying for only getting this service on Android phones, don't waste your money. It only works on Windows and Android app is useless as it always fail to connect. For a whole year of subscription , it worked for few days on Android no matter what the device I use. They would reply that service is blocked in country while it works well on Windows all the time. Inexperienced support on mobile platform indeed.",
            "Edit: already fix it, thank you.. First the app was working good and then (don't know when) the app fail to connect, try to restart my device but failed, then try reinstall but failed connect my subscription account, please fix it. Note: my another device just fine using it,"

I can't even rename a file within the app! If it doesn't get resolved soon I'll have to stop my subscription. Edit: Also urgently needed is the option to 'flatten' documents so as filled in forms can't be changed by someone else later. Even free apps allow this. Now cancelled my subscription until Adobe sort this.",
            "This is useful for editing PDF files i have to edit. But there is some problems that makes it annoying to use: 1.using Fill and Sign Text sometimes undoes itself for no reason. So you must save alot of times which is annoying. 2 sometimes saving also undoes some text 3 there is no copy and paste (well you can paste but you cannot select a text to copy it.)",

There is just no way around Adobe if you want to get the best out of it, especially on the creation side. But seriously, make your applications faster again. They are becoming bloated and slow.",

        "description": "Keeping up with the latest genetic testing guidelines for hereditary cancer can be challenging. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app helps healthcare providers quickly evaluate a patient's personal and family history to determine whether a genetics referral and/or testing is warranted. For quick reference, the app is organized by cancer type. For instance, if your patient has colon cancer (or a family history), the colorectal guidelines indicate the age cutoffs and significant family history features that warrant a genetics evaluation. The guidelines are based on national and professional society criteria that are often referenced by genetics professionals and the health insurance industry. Did you know there are dozens of genes and hereditary cancer conditions to consider when assessing your patient? A family can have many different types of cancers, all linked to a single inherited cancer gene. For example, your patient may have a personal history of prostate cancer, and a family history of breast or pancreatic cancer (as seen in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome). The app is designed to guide your questions as you discuss your patient’s family history. You will be able to determine if your patient meets referral criteria for HBOC syndrome, or another cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is available. Referral guidelines by cancer site: breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, blood (hematology), brain, endometrial, endocrine system, ovarian, skin, stomach, kidney (renal system), lung, and sarcomas. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app also provides quick links to information about labs and genetic testing options, local genetic counseling services, and web-based telegenetic services. Our goal is to create tools that make it easier for you to help your patients take advantage of the latest advances in genetic testing.",

            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",

When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "It's and ok game, I just wish there were more mini games and the different areas for animals should be such high levels to get. Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

Players protect their base —— the Bed, and use all the resources they have to destroy others' beds to win the final victory.\r\nHere are the rules for this game:\r\n- It will divide 16 players into 4 teams.

            "Bed wars...kind of fun game but I only have one problem from the game. The joystick, when I always walk on the bridge (The one with wool that players can buy from game) it always go to the right side of my joystick!!! So I fall down when the joystick let me go to the right. Please fix this bug!!!!",
            "Ok so I got this a few days ago and have already seen hackers and people braking the game. Although it's a very fun game and you will have alot of fun playing. It would be better if it had the creatures or ender pearls(preferably both). And make to where it's one of those games where its you die in the first 3 Minutes of the game. If you fix some or all of these issues I will raise my rating. Other than that I enjoy this game very much so. It is worth downloading.",
            "Sometimes I wonder why this game is still up. I can't even count how many people I see hacking, breaking the game, and more clown moves. And the game producers have done nothing to fix it. So it is really annoying playing the game. But I can't stop beneath all the stuff I listed it is a really adictive game which is why I didnt give one star. But if these things dont get fixed I would rather play something else.",
            "I love this game!!!! it's soo fun..in the real Minecraft bedwars the swords,fireball and more cost ALOT of iron ,gold , diamonds and emeralds and it's harder to PvP so this game is better!!! please make more game's I love this too much!! I hope everyone is doing well and happy in carona virus (covid 19). 🙂🙂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🤍",
            "I only tell honest reviews. This is mine for this game: This game is probably one of the best games for android outside of Minecraft for blocky graphics. It has a very Minecrafty feel to it and I really enjoy playing this. Congrats to the developers. It has every basic weapon that ordinary BedWars has and then some. I also enjoy that everything works like it does is real deal Minecraft. Definitely a good pick."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Keep improving. This game needs a \"heat check.\" If you make 3 shots with the same player, the player should catch fire and gain a boost or special ability. Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",
            "For the love of God fix the damn game crashes... it just doesn't stop. I dont know what happened on the last update but damn guys. The game keeps crashing and logging me off. I cant watch the ads to earn beef because they either won't play or they get stuck and im left with a black screen then have to close the app and start it over to try again. I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."

The game is enjoyable and addictive for the conflict style of game. It's by far the best that I've played of it's style......It's a pity IGG is more interested in making money than the players. Expect to get a \"dah\" response to any real review of the game where they try to promote themselves in spite of your review.",
            "I've been playing the game for a few years, yes is can be grinding at time. And yes, the giant players are pay to play. Buut, it's been a great expereince. I've made a lot of friends, had a ton of fun and keep coming back for me. Also, full disclosure I've probably spent 50 bucks on in game purchases over the last 3 years so I didn't have drop a ton on money to have fun. Mainly spent it on Monster Hunting so in my opinion worth it to have more fun in game.",
            "The game is fun, no doubt about that. The in app purchases seem lackluster at best, as they seldom offer you what you need. Also, if you are willing to roll the dice with the \"chest of chance\" that they offer you, be prepared to spend some money because buying less than 100 of them will leave you as disappointed as a kid on Christmas with no gifts. However, as I mentioned before, the game is fun to play. Customer service ultimately killed this game for me though. Uninstalling now.",
            "What I like about this game are the cool heros. It can be addictive. This is the only game in which I have ever had my hands trembling in anger and anxiety. When my castle gets attacked; screen flashes red making me panic. Then the stupid popups when you open the game gets in the way of you quickly activating your sheild, b/c every second counts in this game. This game also attracts the worst kind of people and also a few nice(guild) people. This game is too demanding so I'll be uninstalling."

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

Ads, ads and ads EVERYWHERE. This is a pet peeve, and i need to turn off my internet just to have peaceful gameplay. Secondly, the bots. Its suprisingly EASY to get past all the stages. Maybe add game modes? Like battle royale mode, a hard mode. Make it challenging once in a while. I don't find this app good or bad, its pretty decent.",

Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

I'm not saying that this problem is on you guys end but, when it logs me out of an online match I lose money each time and can't get it back. I enter these online matches to get more virtual currency but when I'm getting logged out I can do that. So basically I'm losing money and can't gain it.",

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "Great game, lots of fun. Just like Game of war, mobile strike, and all the other games like this though. Fully pay to win. People spend hundreds of dollars a day and then a handful of whales makes all the kingdom rules and do whatever they want. You can spend thousands of dollars and then wait a month or 2 and be obsolete. Unless you can afford dropping 10-20k in the next year, find another game. F2p will dump thousands of hours into this game only to be dominated and crushed by bullies.",
            "Leave this one alone. 2 years into game. Most expensive game ever. It's just to expensive. Ive put a few 1000 $$$$. In the last month alone around $800 into this game and cannot compete. The developers are money gouging. The game has no enjoyment any more. If you do not spend big you will not thrive. And the cost of healing troops is phenomenal. Do not attack or let others attack you, it will send you broke. Dominated by Asian players.",
            "Decided to download after seeing hundreds of this game's ads, and instantly became addicted. This game is easy to pick up and hard to put down because of the fact that, unlike similar titles like Clash of Clans, this game constantly gives you a feeling of accomplishment and progress through everything you do. Rarely is progress slow either, it's a steady climb of power from the moment you start. Also, people in alliances ACTUALLY help eachother grow and everyone can contribute. 10/10.",
            "I love this game. Much more involved as far as team work goes. That's what I like most. THAT, was two years ago. Now whales have taken the game. If you are not willing to spend time (like 2years) playing mostly if not free. Then stay away! There are actual people here who have spent over 10k USD just to be huge. You don't own the game. They can pull the plug any time they choose. And you gain nothing. I am quitting after playing a loyal and honest game. Those qualities will get you nowhere.",
            "The game is good but some little things can be added to make it better. Also alliance members should be allowed an option to give arrows of resistance. it takes to long to get to the last age. And it should be easier to get legendary commanders like Richard the 1st. They need to work more on the game. It should not take 1 year to get to 10 million power, this game out last your device. It should only take 2 months to get to 5 mill not 9 months. Also your verification system is very annoying. 👍"

            "Ridiculous to limit the number of words look up to ONE per day, the app was available for 150INR and is now charged at 800INR/year, very very greedy. Time to uninstall... Hundreds of other options are available . Goodbye Greedy developers. We don't want your service for free and offcourse you were making money from the advertisements, it should be priced at a reasonable price. The earlier One time payment of 150INR to 800INR/year is not justifiable pricing, kindly stop giving lame responses.",
            "Frustrating. Loved the app and used it regularly until the one word limit. Can understand the need for funding but the sudden change is a massive bummer. Have large collections and can't even see the definitions of the words I've stared. Should be free to revisit words I've already saved with 1 limit to new words. The drastic change from unlimited to one word a day is awful. If you do nothing else then change the app description because none of this is free.",
            "Their most recent update made the free version unusable. You can only look up one word a day, unless you pay $10/year. They changed their set up so that they could make more money off of users, but hopefully they'll realize soon they're only lossing money this way and go back to ads. If that happens I'll come back and they'll make money off me again. But really, like everyone else who uses this dictionary I have it out of convenience, I can just Google a word and look it up that way instead.",
            "How disappointing that this app lets users look up ONLY 1 WORD PER DAY all of a sudden! For years, I'd have rated it 5 stars. I was able to look up unlimited words while my device was connected to the internet provided I watched occasional adverts. Also, it used to cost a one-off payment of £9.99 for ad-free access, but now it costs £18.49 per year for any access whatsoever! I own a hard copy of the OED and have it free on my Mac, so this app was purely for convenience. I shall uninstall it now.",
            "I am seriously disappointed by the single word per day. I hate to see this happening, I thought that shouldn't install the third party dictionaries because they may be unauthentic. But, I think I would prefer those than this app. I would prefer to the devs myself that they should at least add a ten words per day policy. That would be much better"

            "The best non intrusive translation app I've ever used thus far. Translated text, SMS, photos, and the new features as of Sept I1 is translating spoken languages. I'm very happy with the app. You can also click on an application and it will translate the app before you even get started using it. Now you tell me how great that is??? Exactly!!! person found this helpful Was this review helpful",
            "This application needs a few adjustments to be a lot better, in my opinion. Translations being more accurate, more languages/more of them available offline, having more voice types where you can change the accents and gender, and a dark mode. It would also be great if the voices were fixed to be more understandable, but some languages do not have voice output whatsoever. One language which I can say does not support voice output is Zulu, which is also a language which cannot be used offline.",

            "Sometimes, this app works very well. It gives me perfect translations. But most of the time, when I try to translate kannada or hindi to english, it gives me only half the words I select. It doesn't even translate it correctly! Like, if I try to translate a poem or a paragraph, it will only give me a few words. And most of the words won't even be translated correctl, it remains the same!",
            "I am using Google translate for more than 5 months and I find it very useful. It is very helpful for my studies also. I can find any translation in the app. Even I can translate my book pages by just showing it to the translate camera. The conversation feature is the best in the app. We can now speak to different people from different languages using that feature. I am very happy with the app. Thank you Google😊😊😊"

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Works great as a vpn but the only reason i didnt give it a five star is because the vpn will randomly turn off wothout notifying you. This becomes a problem because it happens very often. And its not time based either so there is no way to predict when it will happen.",

I would give it a low rating but because it's a decent VPN and a free one ill give it the benefit if the doubt.",

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "The gameplay is good, but for the love of dogs, RANDOM POP UP ADS, WITH SOUND, AFTER EVERY MATCH? SERIOUSLY? Come on BearBit Studios, you're better than this. I know you can fix it by playing with wifi off, but what if i want to stream music while playing? For un online game I'll put up with short ads, as servers cost money to run, bust smashy road has NO online and thus NO SERVERS. this is outrageous.",
            "I play this game a lot, and it is really fun. But i have some suggestions for a future update. 1, the tanks are too fast, 2 the tanks reload speed is also too fast. 3 the car f1 needs something else, like a 5x faster cash, because it dosen't do anything but go fast. 4 please make it so that the cars don't slow down when they are in the grass. I also want to add a new car in the game, it would be a car that when u get arrested, you turn into a cop car and get 5 seconds to get away.",
            "I love this game i absolutley love it the chase speed cars etc is a lot of fun but theres 1 problem. When you get exploded by an oil truck sometimes you get thrown under the map which causes you to fail and i think that should be fixed but other then that 10/10 thank you.",
            "In my personal opinion smashy road wanted is in okay game however I have witnessed a few glitches during the gameplay your probably going to ask what glitches am I discussing about allow me to explain your driving on the road right? then suddenly you crash into a gasoline truck falling threw the map another thing when accidentally bump into one of the bigger police vehicles when you try to back up the car proceeds to go forward eventually you get arrested I do not recommend this game"

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted.

But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",

The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

No use of having great photos if the camera itself cannot be used. I've tried many ways to recover.. but it seems like nothing can be done to fix it. I've read many comments stating the same issue. Dear developer, please do something or you may lose more Pixel user..",
            "Updated phone in October after waiting as long as I could to not update it, and now the camera app no longer works. When I click it just shows a black screen with the camera interface over it, wait a few seconds, then it closes. I tried restarting phone, disabling app, removing other apps, shutting down phone entirely and waiting a while, and even a factory reset. Nothing has worked. Great timing for my trip to Yosemite. Thanks, Google.",
            "Google updated to androoid os 11 and camera won't work, just black screen like every one else. I've done a lot of research on this and it seems to be a widespread problem on not only the early pixels but also the new pixels. Google has had a class action law suit because of problems like this. Google does not care about you or else they would of resolved this. I was going to by the new pixel but now there's no chance in hell will I support the company.",
            "Took my first pictures with my new Pixel 5, the cool 2nd full moon of the month. The pictures are fuzzy, grainy, out of focus. Was excited to try night site. What a disappointment. My Pixel 1 takes better photos. Is this a bug?. Also, where did HDR+ go? No option to toggle or use, obviously didn't work for my moon photos.",
            "Camera stopped working completely after the last update. Tried everything to get it to work. Google was zero help and told me to go use a third party fix it service.... It's THEIR software that needs fixing. Extremely frustrating because my phone is in great condition but now it is useless. A smartphone without a functioning camera??? Do better, Google."

I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yes🤞"

        "description": "Children's doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. \r\nWe present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). \r\nIn this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals.

            "It's great for toddlers! But hey, parents, please PLEASE monitor you kid while playing this game. Ads pop up and they easily could tap on them. They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",
            "Slows down tablets and crashes constantly. So much lagg and crashes it starting to get old fast. About to uninstall this game after 3 days of trying to play."

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

            "Easy to load. No ads. Works as advertised. Not a five -yet. If it's still going good a few months from now, I'll come back and upgrade my rating. Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",
            "Have had this flashlight app for a while and love it! It does what it's supposed to do, without all the unnecessary extras, no annoying adds, and it doesn't glitch on me. Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",
            "I've been looking for this app off and on for roughly 7 years, now. All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",
            "Update 10.10.20: Still just one ad, once in a while, to Rate 5, even if its already a 5, just one click back and i'm back to no ads on the screen & Best Light!... THANKS Developer! [ ... 1st day rated5] ... installing... I have been looking for years for a better light and mine is still Awesome... THIS FLASHLIGHT IS SO BRIGHT, YIKES! (btw Previous lights had pop-ups sending me onto Browser etc! NO POPUPS, so far... So Thanking Now! Simple! Sleeker! Brighter! Awesomest,SoFar...",
            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."

            "This game is actually very fun to play. The controls are prettyty easy to understand and it is perfect for people who wants to play a strategy game while also thinking of how to manage their movements and timing. Just one thing. I suggest a new trap to be added into the game. Maybe a yellow guard where it moves diagonally instead. Overall, exelent game. 5 stars!",
            "As a strategy maze game, it's fun, but only when actual human beings design the mazes themselves. There are several dungeons/mazes that were clearly not conceived by a real person, & there's no way to report this. Also, the game forces you to take a three hour \"time-out\" if it thinks you've been playing too much. There's absolutely no warning, no countdown clock, no \"five minutes to go, wrap it up\", nothing. AND you only get 45 minutes of protection after being raided. Other games give 16 hours.",
            "I put 3 becuz I have new ideas to make this game perfect... I wish, u can control the thief on ur own and I wish there's more traps so it's more challenging, and the last is, I wish I can edit the ground like an obstacle course so it would be amazing. and that is all, bc that was i thinking when I installing the game but it wasn't... :( I still play it tho, I just want some changes to the game. I was going to put it 5 but I put 3... So I really wish u can change the game a little bit.",
            "Was fun at first, but you can tell where people fudged their dungeons to always win. Also the fact that you can't see that some people have it already a sliver of a chance to win before you start. It's kinda a waste of keys. Idk how they get it that small but I'm seeing why I Uninstalled it a couple years ago. Plus the fact that if you respin you almost never get the gem even if it's a 50/50 chance. I spent was too many trying to get one and it's stupid. I've already spent too much money to try.",
            "whenever you watch adds, it still say watch add to do something even though you already did and you also dont get the award most of the times you watch adds. also it takes forever to save a hard base and to save you have to do it two times in a row"

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

Also, and this has happened more than 3 times, it would say I still have to hit a few more cans but there are no cans left to hit. Please fix this. It's very frustrating esp for the harder levels when you're so close to winning.",
            "There are alot of ads running and is very pathetic.. Its like not playing the game but watching the ads.. As i have downloaded it just to watch the ads. Not Worst but it is more then that..",

Only had a very short little go at playing, and that wasnt all that either. There's dozens of bubble shooters much better than this, ones where you actually get to play the game too instead of sitting thru ad after long, boring ad!!",
            "I have been playing this for a long time and loving it. Now I can't get into it. All I get now is a black screen. I've been through all settings trying to fix it. It's been like this for about 2 weeks. I've also uninstalled and re installed at least 3 times with no luck. Help. After reading reviews, it looks like others are having the same problem"

            "It's a good app, but need to be better. There is some problems with this app. My phonetic language is English but whenever I open it, it supports Bengali. It settings,it is showed that FB Lite's language is my phone's language. Another problem is it's network speed. It uses less data, this is good enough. But it takes too much time to load some results (like someone's profile or news feed) please try to solve this problems. Thank u",
            "My opinion about FB lite :- Mobile useres think that LITE is for only common smartphone and for those useres who have poor network. Now I am using Samsung Galaxy tripple camera phone. I also have 4GLTE connection. I have FB Lite app. This is far better than Data & Store consume Giant FB App. Lite is really lite. Store very tiny data and store. It have 100%same quality like FB App. Lite is slim and Fast. And also take my First piority to maintaining Social connection.",
            "The last few months, on my tablet and my phone and my other half's phone, there have been many problems. When you start to post, it crashes, and it goes back to the open where the stars are and the same 2 stars keep flashing. Or the post hangs and you can't post it. Yesterday I couldn't get into my memories all day (10/17) and he has this deal where it says you can't post that. One was my picture. It was my face, not political. This is stupid!",
            "Good but still some bugs. Not possible to save any searches in Marketplace. Since update the search option in Marketplace doesn't work properly. When looking through categories the back button sends you back to the beginning of the category so that you have to scroll forward all the way each time! Sort things out please!",
            "Been using lite for 4 yrs now. The latest update has a problem when it comes to searching. It always repeats the first word or statement that I searched. It doesn't update to the next word I searched. It's annoying when I'm watching a series. Ex. If I already done with \"Naruto ep 1\", I'm just gonna change the \"1 to \"2. And when I'm in ep *3 and want to edit in search tab. It's still in number 1."

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

I use it to turn my screen red at night so it doesn't ruin my night vision. Don't pay attention to the negative ads that say the developer is misleading. The description is one of the best you will read.",
            "Incredible! Bugs attract-repel to the phone screen, wavelength dependent. Then spray them with insecticide as they hover. (Some bugs) they walk the cell screen until I change it to LIGHT BLUE.--They stop walking! Or walk the perimeter of the screen and avoid to L. Blue. This app is the Agar for bugs. Awesome! Developer: Can you program a few buttons to Recall the wavelenghts saved? Thank you so much!",
            "It works... The ads kill the vibe from time to time... But that's why it's free. Unless you have different colored LEDs on your phone. The color change occurs in the screen. Taking showers with the lights off with a colored screen light on... Definitely sets a mood. But the white light from the ads kill the vibe.",
            "This is a useful app. I miss the possibility of paying to stop ads. It's very easy to accidentally touch the banner ad, and then the app disappears and there comes an add you never intended to open. It gets in the way of the usefulness.",
            "i cant say i didn't expect it to make my flashlight shine different colors except white, but you shouldn't mislead people into thinking the flashlight itself would change colors and not just the screen. if you want your flashlight to be a different color then use a marker on clear tape and put it over the light."

A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",

I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

            "Paid for subscription that renewed in June but when I open the app it stills says I need to upgrade to pro. Try to link it says no subscriptions found and yes I made sure it was the right Google play account. Stupid when my Google play specifically says I have a subscription but AVG protection app doesn't even acknowledge it. Waste of money, canceled the subscription.",
            "I don't usually install apps from other sites than Play Market, thus my chances to face viruses and prove if the app is reliable have not been high to this moment. Though, I used the PC version of AVG and it prevented some attacks. So, I think, it is effective. Still, there is an actual inconvenience: \"Web Shield\" stops working from time to time and user has to renew its permission to work in the settings of the mobile phone (Sony Xperia). P.S.: Thank you, I followed your advice.",
            "Generally happy with the app, but not happy with adverts popping up, when I am trying to select apps to hibernate. Some of these ads, spring up, with no obvious way of cancelling them, and can easily be activated, by accident. I am a pensioner, using the free version, as I cannot afford the de-luxe version"

            "I originally got this app because it managed to enhance photo quality of photos over stock camera, it doesn't anymore, in fact it's now the other way around. Navigation to features is quite difficult to use and some sub menus where you wouldn't expect them, making taking a photo time consuming and difficult. Don't download it if you're looking to improve photo quality.",
            "It says the limit size is reached ...and I cannot play atleast a video with 30 seconds ....it was good when I first tried ...I could shoot for 23 mins ..but now it's a trash . And the quality has changed after 2 days I installed. ...I don't find a good quality camera .and I want my front camera to be as a mirror but when I take a photo it gets mirrored again ...the photo looks bad . I don't even have an app with a better camera ..can anyone recommend one for me? It's one one the worst app ...",
            "Not good for video, the adjustments for the video settings are right on top of the start/stop button, I couldn't make any adjustments for color temp or white balance, nothing in video mode. For still shots it's fine but look elsewhere if you want to shoot video.",
            "awesome camera was until it quit saving my photos. I get a circle now with 3 triangles and a dot above them. Says my photo storage is full. But I still have 15.0 . Left in google photo, google drive . There's no reason for it to be storing my photos",
            "At the time of capturing a photo,it Increases the display light and it looks great.But it captures photo as like my phone camera,which is not good..Also there is no option to blur the background..Disgusting.."

I advise you to put the mark erase all text instead of pushing the user to do long press. Placing a paste button. About quick translation, the user does not want to translate every text he copied, here I advise you to use the Google Translator method by showing a floating icon. Often user want to purchase app with one-time payment, add this option and set the price you want.",
            "I really love the app. However, not following the chat option. If I could add someone to chat with from contact list and the other person talk in Spanish and I see it in English and vice-versa that would be optimal. I dont understand who I'm chatting with? What am I missing? I understand now this is a person next to person item. Real time face to face. If you could work with slatch.io and mix in a realtime translated chat you would take over the world.",

But i do have one major flaw thats been bugging me. When i go to redownloading this game on other devices & log back into my account via facebook & google play the game has depleted half of my progress that I had few years back & i know this because i was over level 100 I believe & now Im back at level 45.",
            "Ridiculous that you have to pay real cash to get character mods. You can't pick what character you want to battle with. Takes forever to level up characters unless you want to spend hundreds of real dollars. New update...now gem levels green, purple, and orange have a ground shake that kills any character within 10 seconds of play. Not fun to play if you can't advance power ups. No explanation or any way to beat level.",

The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",

            "This app is great! I always have a hard time locating my phone when I put it down and sometimes even miss the call. NOW I'll receive an incoming call with the Flash going plus the phone ringing so now I have a much better chance locating the phone and answering the call before the caller decides that after three or four rings they've had enough waiting and hang up. I even turned a couple of my friends on to this feature which they are also benefiting from. (I recommend this feature to all) TY..",
            "I love this app. The flash let's me know when I have notifications or call when I don't here the ringtone. Easy and simple to install and set up. 👍👍👍👍👍",
            "Very interesting indeed. I love the application because l never miss a call.",
            "Ok not bad. Wish it had unlimited blinking; it only flashes maximum 10 times. Not 100% reliable though",
            "Best yet. Never miss a call even when youre on silent mode or busy in a meeting. Love it !💯"

            "Tiny Flashlight seems to have everything but the flashlight. I've have this app on another device and I love it. The flashlight, the temperature and percentage of battery charge are what I use, but on this device it doesn't seem to have the flashlight, that's what I need most on this device. I guess that I will have to Uninstall and choose a different one. Sad.",
            "There are many imposter apps, I only use the original Tiny Flashlight. My favorite feature is the light can be default on when the app icon is tapped, no 2nd tap needed to turn on light when the app opens. I only use the TF: classic widget for this app. I like that widget icon because it looks like a flashlight unlike the widget for Tiny Flashlight. TF widget can be turned on/off from the homescreen without the app opening, TF widget turns the light on/off quicker than the app.",
            "Please somebody recommend me any flashlight app. My phones camera flash is very much brighter than inbuilt torch light. I was using a flashlight app which used camera flashlight ,until recently it is using phones inbuilt light which is pretty dim..i installed this tiny flashlight but the problem is still there ,its giving dim light only. Anybody plzz suggest an app that uses camera flashlight",

            "So far, I love this. Easy to play,relaxing, short ads! Graphics are sharp, great levels, progressively more difficult. Especially love the little helper dragon who blasts you out of tough blockades, in fact, his little magic wand slowly refills and allows you to blast through rocks over again. This is so much more satisfying, some games arm you with the wrong color bubbles, forcing you to buy bombs. No thank you! So far this is #1 for me great job to this app maker, thank you!",
            "Would've given 5 stars but certain ads (yatze) do not let you exit the ad and continue game play. Have to exit the game and reload. Very annoying. Also, there are some disturbing ads containing sexual content. I have requested these ads be removed numerous times but they keep showing up. I will probably uninstall this app because of this even though I really enjoy playing.",
            "What a great way to pass the time It's a good game for the whole family, easy enough for the younger or inexperienced. And yet it's challenging enough for the more experienced 'gamers'. But most importantly is the fact that my family really enjoy this game which, of course, makes for a more enjoyable game night. We're looking forward to other apps by this same company.",
            "You all have way to many advertisement s and then try and force a person to spend money. Not all people that play these games gamble. This game is the first that I have seen this many advertisements. Turns a person off to something they may have really tried if it hadn't been pushed on them. I'm going to uninstall because you have turned me off to a lot of things. Thank you. Happy sailing."

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

            "It's fun in the beginning, but gets boring pretty quickly. All the courses seem to be randomly generated, but only between the few different obstacles, so everything is repetitive. The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

Maybe you could fetch the best-fit-pic from a free image repository, like Anki or YouGlish are doing. But packing words in 40 words packages and assigning pics manually [as it sounds from your comment] is too much work and will affect the quality of the content. I'm only talking about the lock-screen options, But I like the app, it is well done and beneficial.",

            "This is a very well designed app. It's clean, uncluttered, & easy to use. I downloaded it for the system tools, but it comes with an awesome wallpaper gallery where you can download them for free. It would be one of the best wallpaper apps on it's own (5⭐) so it's remarkable it's free. There are many high quality wallpapers & a lot of variety so I think there's something for everyone. Just checked out the File Manager app. 5⭐! These guys know how to design & develop software! Rockstars!",
            "I liked this app. I don't mind ads at all. I understand you game developers need a paycheck. But, they were making the app very hard to use. So, I and I image many others wrote feedback, and it is now fixed. Thank you for caring about us & fixinf the issue.",
            "Was wonderful for a while and then ads covering the screen. Scare tactics ads and others. I have never seen so many ads on an app. Makes it hard to use now.",
            "Seems to be doing a satisfactory amount of useful things. I don't rate 5 stars, nothing's perfect and I haven't had it but a short amount of time. So.... rates are rates. That goes for Motels, rental cars, and even apps... as is the case in this example. Also, it offered a rare chance for me to speak eloquently and feel important. Ha ha! After all, it's a great value for FREE.",
            "Very, VERY HELPFUL APP!!! Does exactly what it should. No gimmicks, just straight to the point, VERY easy to use by anyone. I highly recommend this app as a MUST HAVE for any smart phone. Even if your phone is already working well, this app will improve on that with only a couple of taps!! 10 out of 10! 5 out of 5! %100 recommended!!! Perfect app!! Its truly a must have!!!! Try it! You have nothing to lose with this amazing app!!!"
