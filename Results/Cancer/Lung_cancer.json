        "description": "Lung cancer: key points\r\n\r\n    Lung cancer or bronchial cancer develops most often from bronchial cells. There are two main types of bronchial cancers: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. They represent approximately 80% and 20% of cancers, respectively.\r\n    Three types of treatments are used in the management of bronchial cancers: surgery, radiotherapy and medical treatments (chemotherapy and targeted therapies).\r\n    The choice of treatments is adapted to your situation. Several different specialty doctors meet to discuss possible treatment options for you. They are based on recommendations of good practice.

        "descriptionHTML": "Lung cancer: key points<br><br>    Lung cancer or bronchial cancer develops most often from bronchial cells. There are two main types of bronchial cancers: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. They represent approximately 80% and 20% of cancers, respectively.<br>    Three types of treatments are used in the management of bronchial cancers: surgery, radiotherapy and medical treatments (chemotherapy and targeted therapies).<br>    The choice of treatments is adapted to your situation. Several different specialty doctors meet to discuss possible treatment options for you. They are based on recommendations of good practice.

The Tamegagi scoring criteria used in this application is an accepted method of identifying patients for lung cancer screening and has been shown to be superior in sensitivity while maintaining specificity as compared with the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrollment criteria. Use this tool with patients to identify if your patient is eligible for lung cancer screening and to show them the impact smoking is having on their risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nWhat is lung cancer and why is lung cancer screening important?\r\n\r\nLung cancer is a cancer that develops in the parenchyma or airways of the lungs and is most commonly related to smoking, which is the biggest risk factor for this disease. Lung cancer is difficult to identify early due to a lack of specific symptoms, and therefore typically presents at an advanced stage where cure is more difficult and sometimes not possible. Recently, two major studies have been able to show an improvement in survival for patients that are at high risk of developing lung cancer and are screened with an annual low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, in 2015 the US Preventative Task Force (USPTF) endorsed a recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This rating was given a “B” grade which indicates with high certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening, which is the same grade given to mammography for breast cancer.\r\n\r\nSeveral groups, including Tammemagi et al and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), have suggested that today’s screening guidelines may be missing patients who are at risk due to other factors than smoking history and age, such as comorbidities like COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, family history of lung cancer, or certain higher risk minorities. In fact, Tammemagi scoring was found to have improved sensitivity of 83% over the 71% of USPSTF while maintaining specificity of approximately 63%. Therefore, it is clear that there are patients who would benefit from LDCT screening that are currently not being screened and that additional information may be necessary to be collected to further refine lung cancer screening.\r\n\r\nThis application aims to empower patients and providers to determine eligibility for lung cancer screening based on Tammemagi scoring criteria by dramatically simplifying the calculation and showing via a large evidence base the impact added smoking is having on the risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAssisted by Dr. Mark Waddle, Mayo Clinic\r\nMarkRWaddle@gmail.com\r\n\r\nGraphics by Kelly Chtcheprov",

It offers advanced modeling techniques, with a strong focus on performance and interactive computing. It is a powerful, simple to use, and free software, available on Windows, Linux and Android. Moreover, its graphical user interface is fully responsive and adjust for all kinds of screen sizes, including phones, tablets and computers. Furthermore, all the nomograms included in RadioModels share a consistent design that allows for a pleasant and unified experience.<br><br><b>Mission statement:</b><br>The goal of RadioModels is to organize and make more accessible relevant prognostic and predictive models for patient management into a single application. Such models provide useful information and assist radiation oncologist in making decisions about cancer treatment. While there are many models published on medical journals, only a small part of them are implemented on mobile devices. An application allowing quick access to these useful tools during clinical routine was required, and RadioModels was designed for that reason.<br><br><b>Eye-catching charts:</b><br>RadioModels comes with an advanced graphical calculator for visualizing interactively data in a way that is more easy and intuitive to understand the results.<br><br>The following models are included:<br><br><b>Breast Cancer:</b><br>- Breast Fibrosis Risk after Radiotherapy<br>- Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence (boost versus no boost)<br><br><b>Esophageal Cancer:</b><br>- Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation<br>    <br><b>Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma:</b><br>- Post-Operative Chemoradiation<br>    <br><b>Gallbladder Cancer:</b><br>- Post-Operative Chemoradiation<br><br><b>Head &amp; Neck Cancer:</b><br>- Conditional Survival<br>- Post-Operative Radiation for Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Cancer<br><br><b>Lung Cancer:</b><br>- Post-Operative Radiation for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer<br><br><b>Pancreas Cancer:</b><br>- Post-Operative Chemoradiation<br><br><b>Radiobiology:</b><br>- Linear-Quadratic-Linear (LQL) Cell Survival Model with Corrections for Damage Repair and Repopulation Effects<br>- Normal Tissue Complication Probability (Lyman-Kutcher-Burman)<br>- Isodose-Based Morbidity and Mortality Methodology<br><br><b>Radiogenic Cancer Risk:</b><br>- Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII Phase 2)<br><br><b>Rectal Cancer:</b><br>- Conditional Survival<br><br><b>Thyroid Cancer:</b><br>- Cause-Specific Mortality for Differentiated Thyroid Cancer<br><br><b>Supported Operating Systems:</b><br>- Windows 64-bit<br>- Linux 64-bit<br>- Android 4.1 (API 16) or higher<br><br>Builds for Windows and Linux are available at http://oncodesk.com/radiomodels.html<br><br>Important Consumer Information: The Software has been designed for research purposes only and has not been reviewed or approved by the Food and Drug Administration or by any other agency.

        "description": "On estime qu’un homme sur deux et une femme sur trois seront touchés par un cancer au cours de leur vie. Chez l’homme, les cancers les plus fréquents sont : le cancer de la prostate, du poumon et du côlon ; chez la femme, ce sont : le cancer du sein, du côlon et celui du poumon. \r\n\r\nBien manger réduit non seulement le risque de développer un cancer mais l'adjonction d'aliments dits \"anti cancer\" fournit une aide extraordinaire aux cellules de notre corps pour combattre les inflammations et le développement de cellules cancéreuses.\r\n\r\nLe cancer peut toucher tous les organes. Il est dû à la multiplication non contrôlée et la mutation de cellules du corps qui finissent par former une tumeur. \r\n\r\nLe plus souvent la cause est inconnue. Mais certains cancers ont des causes précises : une forte exposition au soleil pour le mélanome, à l’amiante pour le cancer de la plèvre, le tabagisme pour le cancer du poumon… \r\n\r\nNon détruites, ces cellules cancéreuses peuvent envahir d’autres organes.

        "descriptionHTML": "On estime qu’un homme sur deux et une femme sur trois seront touchés par un cancer au cours de leur vie. Chez l’homme, les cancers les plus fréquents sont : le cancer de la prostate, du poumon et du côlon ; chez la femme, ce sont : le cancer du sein, du côlon et celui du poumon. <br><br>Bien manger réduit non seulement le risque de développer un cancer mais l&#39;adjonction d&#39;aliments dits &quot;anti cancer&quot; fournit une aide extraordinaire aux cellules de notre corps pour combattre les inflammations et le développement de cellules cancéreuses.<br><br>Le cancer peut toucher tous les organes. Il est dû à la multiplication non contrôlée et la mutation de cellules du corps qui finissent par former une tumeur. <br><br>Le plus souvent la cause est inconnue. Mais certains cancers ont des causes précises : une forte exposition au soleil pour le mélanome, à l’amiante pour le cancer de la plèvre, le tabagisme pour le cancer du poumon… <br><br>Non détruites, ces cellules cancéreuses peuvent envahir d’autres organes. On parle alors de métastases.

        "description": "How long is the human colon?\r\nThe human large intestine (colon) is about 6 feet long.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is colorectal cancer?\r\nCancers of the colon and rectum (colorectal cancer) start when the process of the normal replacement of colon lining cells goes awry. Mistakes in cell division occur frequently. For reasons that are poorly understood, sometimes mistakes occur that escape our editing systems. When this occurs, these cells begin to divide independently of the normal checks and balances that control growth. As these abnormal cells grow and divide, they can lead to growths within the colon called polyps. Polyps vary in type, but many are precancerous tumors that grow slowly over the course of years and do not spread. As polyps grow, additional genetic mutations further destabilize the cells. When these precancerous tumors change direction (growing into the wall of the tube rather than into the space in the middle of it) and invade other layers of the large intestine (such as the submucosa or muscular layer), the precancerous polyp has become cancerous. In most cases this process is slow, taking at least eight to 10 years to develop from those early aberrant cells to a frank cancer.\r\n\r\nOnce a colorectal cancer forms, it begins to grow in two ways. First, the cancer can grow locally and extend through the wall of the intestine and invade adjacent structures, making the mass (called the primary tumor) more of a problem and harder to remove. Local extension can cause additional symptoms such as pain or fullness, perforation of the colon, or blockages of the colon or nearby structures. Second, as the cancer grows it begins the process of metastasis, shedding thousands of cells a day into the blood and lymphatic system that can cause cancers to form in distant locations. Colorectal cancers most commonly spread first to local lymph nodes before traveling to distant organs. Once local lymph nodes are involved, spread to the liver, the abdominal cavity, and the lung are the next most common destinations of metastatic spread.\r\n\r\nColorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer in the U.S. in both men and women. It affects almost 135,000 people annually, representing 8% of all cancers.

        "description": "The easiest, least expensive way to reduce your risk for cancer is just by eating a healthy diet. When it comes to a diet rich in cancer-fighting substances, most experts agree that it should consist of a predominantly plant-based diet. \"If you have two-thirds of plant food on your plate, that seems to be enough to avoid excessive amounts of food high in saturated fat. That seemingly simple advice could mean a drastic change in diet for many people.\r\n\r\nPeople who are thinking that this is like a diet, and are trying to choke this stuff down, it's never going to last. You're looking at creating something for a lifetime. If it takes you awhile, but each month or so you enjoy [one more vegetable], then that's great.\r\n\r\nThe extracts from cruciferous vegetables as well as those from vegetables of the genus Allium inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines whereas extracts from vegetables most commonly consumed in Western countries were much less effective. The antiproliferative effect of vegetables was specific to cells of cancerous origin and was found to be largely independent of their antioxidant properties. These results thus indicate that vegetables have very different inhibitory activities towards cancer cells and that the inclusion of cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive strategies.\r\n\r\nTranslation:\r\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies stopped cancer growth.\r\n- Commonly consumed vegetables did not work as well.\r\n- The antioxidant content of veggies was not a key anti-cancer factor.\r\n- Different vegetables work for different cancers.\r\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies should be eaten to prevent cancer.\r\nSo the most commonly consumed vegetables in Western countries had very little effect on cancer cell growth. The top three (potatoes, lettuce and carrots) account for 60% of the vegetables we Westerners are eating. 32% of our vegetable intake is potatoes, and half of that is actually french fries. Dark greens, cruciferous veggies and garlic account for less than 1% of our Western diet!\r\n\r\nRadishes were shown to stop tumor growth by 95-100% for breast and stomach cancer, but had no effect and may have even increased tumor growth by 20-25% in pancreatic, brain, lung and kidney cancer. Definitely something to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nYou may want to start with some of the following food substances, all of which show promise as cancer-fighting agents.\r\n\r\nTake this list to your next grocery visit, and stock up on these cancer fighting ingredients. And remember to make fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains the biggest part of every meal. Add some of these healthy foods to your diet to help prevent cancer and keep other diseases at bay.",

High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos.\r\n\r\nAsbestos exposure and the onset of cancer are generally separated by about 40 years. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the tumor. \r\nReferences Official:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma\r\nMesothelioma\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\n\r\nAsbestos Cancer\r\nIt’s made up of silicon, oxygen, hydrogen and other metallic ions. Asbestos fibers are strong, flexible and won’t burn. They also insulate very well and don’t break down easily. Asbestos was used in old plastics, paper products, and floor tiles. In most cases, asbestos fibers are combined with a material that binds them together, producing asbestos containing material, otherwise known as ACM.

Proper classification and staging of cancer is essential for the physician to assign proper treatment, evaluate results of management and clinical trials, and to serve as the standard for local, regional and international reporting on cancer incidence and outcome.\r\nUsed with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois. The original source for this information is the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Eighth Edition (2016) published by Springer Science+Business Media.\r\n\r\nSignificantly expanded and developed by international disease site expert panels, the Eighth Edition TNM Cancer Staging Manual brings together all the currently available knowledge on the staging of cancer at various anatomic sites. In this edition, evidence-based TNM staging is supplemented, as appropriate, by selected molecular markers and newly acquired insights into the molecular underpinnings of cancer.

It is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. \r\n\r\nIs there Cancer cure through Baking Soda?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage your Cancer is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in managing Cancer with alternative techniques.\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments. \r\n\r\nIs any of your loved ones suffering from Lung, throat, skin, breast, prostate, colon, bladder, ovarian, liver, cervical Cancer, or testicular Cancer..? Do you want to know the signs, symptoms or Cancer survival rate? \r\n \r\nThis app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your Cancer and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care.

Patients need the information stored in this app and if their connection to the app is gone there should be a way to retrieve it. There is no back up of information.",

I don't trust pop-ups like that so i immediately uninstalled it. It's a shame because it did look helpful and I hadn't been able to find anything else like it. I'm waiting to see if this pop-up occurs again anywhere else. If it turns out to be unrelated I will definitely try it again."

Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\nYou've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\n\r\n1. Don't use tobacco\r\nUsing any type of tobacco puts you on a collision course with cancer. Smoking has been linked to various types of cancer — including cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, larynx, pancreas, bladder, cervix and kidney. Chewing tobacco has been linked to cancer of the oral cavity and pancreas. Even if you don't use tobacco, exposure to secondhand smoke might increase your risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAvoiding tobacco — or deciding to stop using it — is an important part of cancer prevention. If you need help quitting tobacco, ask your doctor about stop-smoking products and other strategies for quitting.\r\n\r\n2. Eat a healthy diet\r\nAlthough making healthy selections at the grocery store and at mealtime can't guarantee cancer prevention, it might reduce your risk. Consider these guidelines:\r\n\r\nEat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Base your diet on fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant sources — such as whole grains and beans.\r\nAvoid obesity. Eat lighter and leaner by choosing fewer high-calorie foods, including refined sugars and fat from animal sources.\r\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, do so only in moderation The risk of various types of cancer — including cancer of the breast, colon, lung, kidney, and liver — increases with the amount of alcohol you drink and the length of time you've been drinking regularly.\r\nLimit processed meats. A report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, concluded that eating large amounts of processed meat can slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancer.\r\nIn addition, women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts might have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active\r\nMaintaining a healthy weight might lower the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon, and kidney.\r\n\r\nPhysical activity counts, too. In addition to helping you control your weight, physical activity on its own might lower the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.\r\n\r\nAdults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits. But for substantial health benefits, strive to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. You can also do a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine — and if you can do more, even better.\r\n\r\nKeywords:-\r\n\r\n1. Cancer\r\n2. Medical\r\n3.

A report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, concluded that eating large amounts of processed meat can slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancer.<br>In addition, women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts might have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.<br><br>3. Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active<br>Maintaining a healthy weight might lower the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon, and kidney.<br><br>Physical activity counts, too. In addition to helping you control your weight, physical activity on its own might lower the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.<br><br>Adults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits. But for substantial health benefits, strive to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. You can also do a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine — and if you can do more, even better.<br><br>Keywords:-<br><br>1. Cancer<br>2. Medical<br>3.

In a panic, you fork over 20 dollars because what else are you gonna do? Anyway your paper ends up late, AND you're out 20 bucks. The kicker? They then ask you to rate the app. The only clickable option? 5 stars. These guys are dirtbags.",

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

It doesn't want you to log in to your social media. It doesn't want to know your location. It only wants you to quit!\r\n\r\n• Time-tracking: The app tracks your time free of smoke by the second, giving you detailed info of the chemicals you've avoided by quitting, as well as the money saved. Save money AND your health. Heck yes.\r\n\r\n• Lets you smoke (sometimes): The app allows you to smoke if you REALLY need to. You can smoke up to 5.5 cigarettes per day. The app will use video ads to deter you from doing so.\r\n\r\n• Health-tracking: It shows your health benefits according to when you last smoked. Ever wondered how much Acetaldehyde you've avoided since you last smoked? Check! Isoprene? Check! Tar? Check! In addition, the apps shows you the peer-reviewed papers it bases its calculations on (e.g. Cancer risk, insulin resistance, inflammation markers, etc).\r\n\r\n• Money-tracking: Tracks the millions* you'll save by quitting. You can show your wife/husband that you've saved enough for that huge TV you've been thinking of getting without* getting yelled at. All thanks to SmokeQuitter.\r\n\r\n• Lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral cavity cancer, insulin resistance, carbon monoxide poisoning, inflammation markers... it tracks it all.\r\n\r\n• Tips: SmokeQuitter gives you craving \"tips\" as well as allowing you to smoke if things get too ugly (it tracks this too!). It promotes the usage of validated smoking-cessation techniques/products to help improve your chances of quitting (This App does NOT replace a medically assisted cessation therapy monitored by a specialist).\r\n\r\n• Friends: SmokeQuitter allows you to keep track of friends that are also trying to quit.

I have high hopes for this and have started vaping at the same time as installing the app. Edit... What might be cool is if you could add something to keep track of spending on nicotine replacement and vape. Just to keep the saving numbers straight Also. I cannot see any way to admit to a slip up. I dont intend to slip but don't want to have a total reset if I did",

Doesn't make much sense. So when I do quit I have to start the app all over. Otherwise great app.",

I selected vape for my booster and it shows up on the dashboard. Thank you for making an app that actually works and allows the user to quit cigarettes the they want or need to."

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "challenging & interesting game. Certain levels are too challenging for the simple minded like me! Tempted to give up many times as it's too time consuming! 😢Don't understand why the gold bars are not available for use even though the piggy bank has been full many times. Getting too difficult to complete a level, impossible in fact for hours on end. Very tempted to give up all together & try other games. Getting to a stage where it's too time consuming to complete a level. Losing interest.",
            "This game is fun sometimes, until you have one left and you lose. This game is rigged. Cause they can give you what you need if there is only one left, but they want you to spend money, and when you do spend a little money, you would expect to get cheaper prizes and better prizes. Y'all need to do something about it because im getting annoyed when that happens after I've spent $30 or $40, im expecting better results with my spending",
            "Been Playing for 10 years and I'm obsessed with this game. I love the animals and the challenges, I have gotten all of the animals in the game w/o really putting 5$ in and playing on/off for so many years. So Its a great game with great side games you can play for hours. To the Developers I would like to see more of the level streak boost. For every level you pass you get boosters on your next like the candy crush sagas have. Thank You if you made it here!",
            "Great game until you reach the pay wall level. Move the sheep to the hay.. yeah when the game decides that you're allowed to. No information provided on how to move the sheep, thought I'd got the last sheep to the hay with my last move but NOOOO.. game decides that the same move I'd made with the previous sheep was not allowed. 100% designed like this so you spend money. Well not me. Deleted. As with candy crush take your game and SHOVE IT!!!!",
            "fun till it started cheating😡When it starts cheating again I will uninstall it again. It is ok for awhile then it cheats. Funny that the cheating starts when a player reaches higher levels. I am not going to pay for gold bars I have \"WON.\" A lot of time is wasted on ads and other nonsense. I spend mote time watching dumb ads than playing...boo!"

I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

            "I purchased a year subscription a couple months ago. It was great now in this last week it has so many glitches and each item doesn't want to open takes forever! And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "Constantly crashing...... this app would allow you the odd video for a booster or extra few moves, but every video link crashes the app which means you lose where you were, and can't progress anywhere. I get the whole idea is to encourage you to buy etc, but the app should still function. Really tempted to just give up. Shame, had been a good boredom buster up to this point.",
            "Candy Crush Soda Saga is the best and fun game i've ever played...it has so so many levels that you can play...some are hard and some are easy to play...i really never thought that i could play this game as i'm playing it now..level 920 isthe hardest level in the game but is fun to play it again and again...",
            "I used to enjoy the game. But, as you progress the levels, the fish are of no use. It seems like they deliberately go to the wrong places when you are in the final moves of any hard level. This leads to the loss of streak as well. Why are the fishies acting all weird?!!",
            "At first is a interesting game, but once you've got to hard level, became really bad and boring for that reason your lucky that i give you 1 star. ..but I won't spend my money buying, life's, this game really this game really sucks cause freeze every time once you reach higher level. ..fix the problem if you're charging all those gifts..what about golden reward? I I hate it when I get to higher level past 100 it freezes and I have to uninstal the game..",
            "Its like when you are playing the game, it wants you to use their moves, which may be way up at the top of the board., and its ludicrous to use their moves, that they are trying to make u use. Thats using up your tries. Makes no sense to use their moves suggestions. And if you don't use their suggestion, they make it difficult to try your own moves, it will get stuck until u use their moves. Almost said their dumb suggestions, because they want you to fail. I earned 13 gold bars, r gone. ."

Then when you go to use gold bars, if then boots you out. There is still the mini game from lock down too on there that if you push the wrong button, freezes the app and you have to come out and restart again. It's not lack of memory as when I tried it on the tablet I have the same issue...",
            "it is addicting and lots of fun to play. Never gets old! It gets more challenging the higher you go in the levels. Im nearly to leel 500 and its still fun. has gotten really strategic now in levels 500 and above. Now at level 720, it has become much more difficult and at times can be not so much fun but I seem to stick with it to keep going to higher levels. I will find myself on the same level for a while and then suddenly get it and that keeps me interested. I am in level 958 now",
            "I love this game. The only thing that makes me mad at it is the fact the the fairies are dumb af. I mean instead of helping they just don't... how many times have I lost a level cause there are 3 bubbles, one of them is going to fall, but the fairy still chooses that one... other than that yes. I love the game.",
            "Love it! Been playing over 2 years, lol... and I'm on level 2,433! It's very addicting. I love playing it when I'm bored and in my breaks at work. I also like how they change things up and the bonus levels! Keep up the good work!",
            "Immediately unplayable for me. Every shot makes the screen briefly flash and shake. No idea why games want to alienate anyone with motion sickness, migraines, seizure risk, etc. No reason why you can't have a nice looking game without the constant movement, flashing, sparkling, shaking the screen."

            "Fun game...longest I have ever kept a game on my phone. LOVE that I don't have to sit through commercials in order to play or anything!! A few years, when I first started playing, I had the ability to win time...I miss that. Made it more fun to win an hour (up to 24 hrs) of free play time. Guess they lost too much $$ on people not buying items to help them pass a level. Oh well.",
            "I love this game. Great way to pass the time. I do have a couple of things. What if for every 100 levels you get one of each boost and 25 coins? Maybe bring back challenge of unlimited lives for a 24 hours? Sometimes it sucks when it takes 3 days to complete one level, it gets frustrating and boring. I have spent many hours playing this game and spent some money and do really enjoy it.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until it got to the higher levels (im on level 3564) I have spent plenty of money on this game because once you only get 5 free lives and when your out it takes 20 minutes to get another life. I understand the levels will get harder but I think its ridiculous to only get a new life every 20 minutes. I don't want to have to delete this app but I can't continue to spend $1.99-$12.99 just to be able to play continuously.",
            "I actually really love this game. there's no ads (!!!!!!) and there's really no need to spend money if u are patient. it's pretty much entirely luck based so as long as u are patient and keep trying u can pass any level. my only complaint is some of the levels seem unnecessarily hard which can get very frustrating but other than that I would highly recommend this game",
            "Play game all the time my only problem is that you have to continuesly have to update after doing 50 levels beyond 4000, and my Facebook friends dissappeared. Hey Doodle Bob I am a real person playing this game and yes I passed level 4000. I can honestly say, I have NOT spent any money on this game and do not plan on it. Just wait for lives to add up and continue to play."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

I wanted to wait until I got along further in the game to comment my honest reply. I'm currently on level 331. At first yes it's VERY EASY, but as it goes on the levels do get harder, but the hints are very helpful!!",

            "Third review: BORING. Too hard. Requires insider knowledge of how to beat each level without mistakes. Spent weeks on one level. Without insider knowledge, you must pay a LOT of money to keep going level after level, using multiple helps per level. This is an excellent way to keep people from coming back to the game. Once it becomes impossible, people simply uninstall. No other King Game is this bad.",
            "I'm giving it 1 star because you decide to remove the only task (collecting flowers), that can help us gain powerups to help us get through stages with your new update. There is no other way to get extra gold like the other games. So disappointing. I'm considering uninstalling this game. After playing after 1000 stages it is very disheartening. You promise events and none has appeared to date. You remove the only fun thing about this game. Now there is no challenge so disappointing.",
            "Hi I've been stuck on the same level for two months now. It's impossible to get through. I have used some of the resources already and nothing is happening. Game now also more for children with the bad craffics. Maybe I should just delete it. Now no more fun and freebies anymore. Get felt the same rubbish over and over. please do something.",
            "I used to absolutely love this game and have played it for years. The new update looks like actual garbage and I don't even want to play it anymore. It looks childish and I miss the beautiful graphics. I keep opening the app because I loved the game but one look at the graphics makes me close it again. This useless update made me lose all interest in playing and I will be deleting the app.",
            "The recent unavoidable mandatory update removed High Scores for no good reason, removing the very reason for even HAVING a scoring system, and thus the Point of the game, to GET Points. Do the game Programmers actually PLAY their own games, i am guessing they do not or they would know this is a big Problem. King has a habit of changing their games once they become very popular and always makes them WORSE. Why do they keep removing the one thing that made their games fun and challenging ?"

        "comments": [
            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

(we are able to share only one document at a time from the app.) And next point is 2. give us an option to reorder the pages and mark the number on the page. 3.if we select one filter for an image, it should automatically select the same filter from next time.",
            "I like this app, it's the best scanner and really easy to organise. I didn't give full stars because there isn't an option to edit the name, or edit the documents. Like scan a few more, or delete a few once you have saved it onto the device. If I make a mistake I have to rescan everything. Nonetheless, I am still using this app because there are no ads and it's a quality scanner!",
            "It's a nice app, especially if you have an outlook account. When you save it, it saves directly to your account after you log in once, and you can also choose what to save it as (pdf, jpeg, etc. . .). The only thing is, if you have bad lighting, sometimes the scanner won't pick up the edges of your paper. Which is a given for any scanner, but if you're in a rush it can cost you time. It doesn't have pop up ads like some other scanners I've used so that's also a plus.",
            "This is an amzing app. If we click a photo for scanning from any angle, it automatically makes the photo clear and straight. I could have given 5 stars to this app, if there could be one more feature in it. Today I had to scan the images of my test paper and by mistake, I forgot one page to scan. So I scanned it at the last thinking that *there will be an option to reorder the pages in a correct format*. But I wasnt able to reorder. Please add page reordering feature in this app. Thank you.😊",
            "I couldn't find a proper pdf creator and was in desperate need of one due to my exams. Them I found this and I am so very grateful that I did. Works just fine and captures the document from whichever angle I click. Only one thing, today I forgot to rename the file before saving it. And then I couldn't find any option to rename it. So I had to click the pictures of the pages again. If there is a renaming option, please help me find it but if not, that's an improvement you must make."

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",

            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results! I hope everyone who screwed up the yelp app to make more money instead of being actually a useful app dies of a horrible disease!"

            "I really love this game. I love the variety of songs. I did not give a 5 star because of the gameplay. You can't click two notes at once which is kind of frustrating, unlike other music games. As much as its kind of challenging, I find it really annoying and bothersome. I hope this can be improved. Likewise, this game is 10/10 if ignoring the problem",
            "It's not a bad game; in fact, it's quite fun. However, every few notes, the note won't register a tap or will glitch and will register too late, causing a level to fail. Now, this would be fine if it happened every once in a while, but it happens predictably and can be incredibly infuriating when you're super close to finishing a level and don't want to watch an ad only to have it happen again.",
            "This game is fun to play if you're interested in songs and musical things and better than most piano music games, well this is only my opinion so if you are reading my comment/review on this music app I recommend to go ahead and download this app and give it a go! If you do dislike it or find something not to your liking then you can comment/review (Like me) on what you want the creators to fix or add. It's free and you can always delete it anytime! So give it a go! Who knows you might like it!",

I love it bcs it have so many anime and kpop song that I wanna play in piano so bad ^^ also can u please add Haikyuu openings and endings song? thnk you (/^-^)/ ( sorry if my english is bad (^～^;)ゞ )",
            "This is the most best experience I had in a game if your thinking on downloading it I hope you do cuz this is one of my best and favorite experience ever this is a very nice and wonderful game there's nothing wrong with it I absolutely love this game in any way hope you find so to ♡´･ᴗ･`♡"

            "You should also add an option where users can sell their unused equipments to add in their funds so that it won't turn into waste after upgrading. And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

            "It is an amazing game and it is really relaxing. I was fully depressed last month when the exams came, for 2 days I played this and then it was just so smooth. In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "I've played this game for years; since first introduced. I literally had accumulated over a 1000 of the various boosters. The update at the end of Sept completely screwed up my game. It set me back 12 levels, & every single booster I had was gone. They sent another update a few days later with 10 gold bars. Big deal. I tried reaching out multiple times, with no reply. I uninstalled the app, & tried logging back in with FB, but it had saved me at the \"bad\" version, so no help. Garbage developers.",
            "None of the cards in the feckmatch the cards in the playing field and the key is always gone always ! This used to be a good game to play ,now you have to buy joker's and other boosters just to pass the level , not so much fun as it is aggravating . really just really ! ! ! Guess that it's time to uninstall this game. Once again ,the cards in the deck math none in the playing field ,been on this level for 2 week's F$&k this game !",
            "I have to say that after I voiced all my complaints and problems the Pyramid folks have really stepped up to the plate & listened. I have never had such great interactions and speedy fixes. I hope that this continues and that they continue with the fun and challenges by continuing to create more levels. Thank you Pyramid folks, keep up the good work. ❤",
            "Fun game but would be nice to receive daily boosters. Some of the levels are pretty difficult and once you've used what boosters you had to pass you're basically out of luck. I've deleted the game several times for that reason. I do come back in hopes that maybe they've changed so that a person can receive a daily booster but nope. Thinking of deleting again. When you have issues they don't get back to you either.",
            "Was really enjoying this until it insisted I updated. When I tried playing it again it had wiped out everything I'd done including saved levels and gone back to the first level. Really not impressed. Won't be bothering to start again, so wont play it again. Have it three stars as I did enjoy the game and would have given it more but would give it a big fat nought for wiping everything out."

I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

Some levels are also very difficult to pass even when boosters are used. I'm under level 1700 at the moment and I do want to give up the game due to the frustration of taking so many attempts just to clear a stage. Sometimes even stuck at one level for hours, despite wasting several boosters for said level. Avoid this app",

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

            "The game is quiet fun, but my first impression of the game was that it was slow. Within the first hour of playing, I got bored. An \"optional\" increase in speed (×2) could be good. People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

I wished there could be more flavors, costumers and fruits added in the game, and that we could make used of the extra heavy cream and condensed milk because i think it's a waste. I also won't forgive that panda with a blue tie.",
            "Nice game i love it from the time i download it but the reason why i did'nt give this full star was because i just need to repeat the same thing again and again make popsicles as usual and sell thats it, you can buy other flavours and fruits by selling the icecreams and getting money from it but still than youll get boring after sometimes espically grown up people but this game is not bad nor good its midium other than that you can download it good game.",
            "Great,fun the baby bus games in these kind of graphics are more fun and better. I'm 8 years old I know that these games might be for baby's because it's from baby bus but it's still so fun I'm sure that this is the best baby bus game in all of Play Store!!!!!

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",
            "I have reached out to support team multiple times still no results. I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

            "Challenging and great pictures. Very clear and interesting photography. Zoom is helpful and pictures don't blur when using it. I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",
            "Fun game, pictures are great. Would love if it told you where the pictures were taken. I would recommend this Find the Differences game",
            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

            "I love this game, but, they only allow you 12 free tickets every 40 minutes or so. It costs at least 4 tickets to play 4 cards in a round. So, this 12 tickets yet burned up pretty fast. And, who wants to stop playing and have to exit the game and wait 40 minutes for more tickets??? It's a hassle! So, when you run out of tickets, they offer in ad purchases to buy more tickets, and that's where they get you. I have not found a bingo game that is actually free to play. It's a shame!!!",
            "ADDICTED!!!!!! I wish you would put an option in to use our coins to be able to buy at least 10 tickets. I'm a poor 49 year old with a son who plays 2 sports a senior in high school and a daughter who just graduated college and needed a reliable car. So I gave her mine, since she's an elementary school teacher and needs to mold the minds of the future game designer's who will take your jobs in the future..... Damn sorry to ramble on, let me buy tickets with coins. Respectfully, A broke Dad. Lol",
            "Playing higher level now. Fun, but having fewer bingos, than when I had played for the first time. The reason I stopped this game, before, was cause I got tired of seeming to be forced to buy things to progress. I became angry an frustrated. Time will tell if I put up with this for long. Hate to stop. But I will. Their second chance will end. Will update.",
            "By far the best bingo game I've played! The tutorial when starting the game is very helpful. So many options for avatar and dauber. The voice call outs are different from room to room which makes it more entertaining. The leveling up rewards are great. Not interrupted with ads. Not required to spend money (available if you want to). Only drawback is that your account doesn't work on multiple devices.",
            "This is the only Bingo app I play. You don't have to use real money if you can't afford to. The graphics are neat and there's lots of 'rooms' to play. One of my favorite things is how all the callers sound different. Some times there are one or two callers that have a thick accent, but it's easy to watch the 'boards foe which number is called."

            "Game is fun, but its hard pay to play, even spend some money to buy better plane but that was enough only for 20 lvl's, and there is 200+ lvls, if u want to move after that its pay to play, really hard progress without spending alot of money, i get the devs needs to get paid, but this is too much, getting diamonds should be really increased or decreased the items that cost alot, as i c it now will never get pass lvl 50, so probabbly gonna give this game, and find simillar cheaper game",
            "The game is fun, until you realize it is not just difficult. It is stupid difficult. After you get to level 100. You will start figuring out that in order to move any further, you will need to start dropping some $$$ on the game to upgrade/obtain better aircrafts and weapons to defeat even easy levels. Fun for a while but just don't invest your time/money past level 100. But the hook is real and the developers knows it.",
            "This game went from pretty good to absolutely screwed up in one update, which it took 2 more updates to even get working. They reduced the power of everything, took all our devices we had earned or bought and deleted them and gave us credits for the new stuff, which wasn't close to worth the amount of work we put in to it. Stay clear of this game Another update and it still sucks. This has no gone from a free game to pay to play. AS IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS Stay clear of this app.",
            "In multi-player your opponents are allowed to use all their planes even though they have a far lower rank than you, Dumb AF! Then when I updated it stopped letting me collect the vip points. Used to be able to watch a video to collect up to 20 points a day, not now though. It still has vip points as part of the game, but now there is no way to earn them. Unless you pay. GAME USED TO BE GOOD befor they made it PAY TO PLAY!",
            "UPDATE: 10-23-2020. The developers got back in touch with me and release a update. The problem has been fixed!!! 4 stars! OLDER REVIEW; This game is fun and I would love to spend money on it. But it is glitchy with its' pop ups. And no I'm not talking about ads. I'm just talking about regular in game menus. For example; after I successfully complete a mission flawlessly. It will then give me the ability to watch a ad for extra coins. I do that, then I click continue. Once I'm back at the main screen, it then will pop up with, \"here is a special deal\" or \"congrats you went up a rank.\" But then it will permanently freeze the game. Even if I hit okay on this pop up, it just stays there with the sound of the game in the background playing and the green okay button recognizing that I'm hitting okay. However the menu stays up and I can't even back out of it. So I have to close the app using my phone instead and then re login back into the game. PLEASE FIX THIS!"

            "when I first downloaded this game it was good ....playable even with the adds you could skip around ...but now it's worthless ....they make you watch at least 8 to 10 seconds of adds each and every time your game concludes weather or not you have advanced ....it wouldn't be so bad if you did make another level but when you're stuck on one the last thing you need is to wait for a damn add for another game!!!I personally I think they have f**ked this game up all to hell",
            "Good game, i would give this bad boy 5 stars but for some reason the projectile that comes out of the gun has brass attached still. Other than that. Its a sweet game",
            "I'm awake! Just thought I would try this game, man, I hope you try so you can feel what I feel right now. Excitement is all around you, the enemy is too, get the rusty ole rifle and pick a spot, the action is swift and the ship is moving. Try this game and you will be moving too! Or ? Get moving sniper, lock & load!",
            "After level 400 it's almost impossible to continue except you spent a lot of money for Dia to remove the unrealistic wind effect every time. Upgrades like guns, bullets and so on are not more than a kind of a placebo. Try yourself and compare it by playing a minigame using different stuff. I have fired more than 50k real bullets up to distances of 300 meters in my life and even in hard wind. I never experienced such a wind effect, not a 2 ms and not at 4 ms not even with a muzzle loader rifle.",
            "Ads galore!! When will the mobile gaming market move out of this sleazy, cheap practice of freemium games, and move onto the next era like with demos, then buy the game of you like it? No darn ads... UDATE: Spent coin on an upgrade, then next time I went in, the upgrade was not available. It was like I never bought it! And I lost all that coin too! No way would I put real money into this game."

A good sparkle effect app. I use it to make 90's edits things, and it's extremely useful to be able to actually choose where the sparkles go, and the size-Unlike literally every other app I've used. I swear, I've been looking for hours for one like this?? In summary, it's good, and I'll actually use this.",

Don’t be shy, join the fun! <br><br>Coming back after a break? About time! <br><br>Let’s play!",

            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "Use to be a great app. Used it for years to do edits and the like; colored my traditional art with it. The new update has made it basically unusable. The layout is completely different, certain options have been removed, and anything that actually made the app useful has been ruined or removed. The ads every 5 seconds certainly dont help. It's useless now; severely disappointed.",
            "I use the like this app. The they went and change the apps name and icon, made it work and look like 100's of other apps out there and filled it with adds. When the name changed I got furious thinking somehow a app installed itself. I opened the app and dit not recognized it. Luckily I had sceen shots of my icons abd this is the only way I figured out that this was a app I installed and used. Golden Rule that the world seem to have forgotten: If something is working, don't try and fix it.",

            "It used to be good, but now I seem to have noticed that: The cue balls mysteriously bounce back out or don't go in when it is a clear shot. The power meter is a hit or miss-it doesn't shoot when you intend to and you then have to pull it again which then messes up the direction of your shot (half your time has gone by then). There are too many cheaters. Too many players abusing the connection function to waste time in the game. 8 Ball Pool Popups every few seconds are annoying.",
            "Was having a good entertaining experience, when all of a sudden don't know for what reason all my progress just vanished. Tried to reach the developers but they have not responded till yet. My level which was 41suddenly backed to 5. All my winnings were gone. Was expecting a prompt help for the same. But it seems the developers are no more intrested in good reviews. I am really disappointed.",
            "Love 8 ball pool !!! I loved the pool pass ,but couldn't afford to buy anything. But love playing for it. It's been updated a lot to improve it . That's a plus!!! I love 8 ball and 9 ball, but like others on here , some of the things happening are unbelievable, balls just hanging on the edge , the cue moving when it was aimed to shoot, and coins disappearing!!! And other players stealing your turn, and your coins. Please fix this stuff happening. A true patriot of 8 Ball Pool. Love it !!!",
            "The game was good when I started playing it but now that I've progressed it's like your playing a robot, perfect shot, perfect english on the ball, every shot just perfect. Don't waste your money buying coins trying to advance quicker it doesn't help, you'll only lose them quicker and have to buy more. The weekend games are usually won by the same people if you watch the standings. A perfect bank shot will run off course like the table isn't level, did it today!!",
            "Constantly hangs up. After an update the program became worse. It only allows me 2 seconds to play and then switches players. It does not record a ball made. It replayed the same player when i chose not to. It never allowed me to play, it hanged up for 3 minutes and it ended the game and the other player won. I'm ready to abandon this game. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!"

            "I don't know how people are giving this app one star!, I have had just ONE problem plus, I think it really works because I'm getting these spam messages and it's stopped the spam. I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

            "This app is great with helping to clean files and monitoring apps using up your battery and/or memory. I have only had them for about a week now."

            "I installed this game for those moments when I want to relax and enjoy. However, I think I used all my patience now. Levels take on average 40-50 trials (I'm only on level 1413), the game is constantly interrupted with ads (abundantly). So without being able to progress in this game and being constantly bombarded with ads, it became almost a torture. Adding to this, weekly Suburban Stroll seems to be stuck - no new rooms have been unlocked for few months. I accumulated 14k coins, but no joy...",
            "I was going to write my positives 1st,I simply love this game. I play it multiple times a day, but due to lack of room I'll just have to go to my negative. The Suburban stroll Why are there no additional rooms/places to decorate. It's been many months since I finished the beach scene and with all the updates, no more have been added. I have 7000+ tickets, and I've quit playing it from time to time and still nowhere to spend them. You've had multiple updates why have you not added in to that?",
            "Don't pay for anything on this app. They have been charging my credit card every week for months. They will not return my money. When I send emails I get automated replies to key words. Nothing to do with my complaint. If you get a reward for free play you can not save it. It has to be used right then. If I am about to beat a level I have noticed the the pieces move the opposite direction I want them too. This game is ok to waist a little time but not really worth it. I can recommend 20",
            "It's an amazing app, there are lot of rooms to decorate and tons of levels to clear. We can watch an advertisement and get a free energy and money, there are many events in every month. I love this game very much...",
            "The amount of ads makes this game unplayable by the time you pass like the 30th level. I had to play two ads just to START the game. If you want folks to pay for no ads, make it a paid game at a reasonable price and not a freaking WEEKLY SUBSCRIPTION model, are you kidding me. None of these mobile games are worth hundreds of dollars. Cut it out"

            "I enjoyed this game but it now very frustrating because it is so hard to win any games. Like ridiculously hard. It never used to be like this. Truly sad as I've put a lot of time and money into this game, it shouldn't be the only way you win is to spend money on power ups.",
            "Great game, beautiful graphics and themes. Fun to play, requires strategy- as you advanced and level up-, it becomes harder- but I love that there's also extra rewards and power up earned as you advanced.",
            "Like the game . But? I know on Android I can not even make a log in for jam city . The app will not open my keyboard so I can type it in my email. Ugh the pain . Please fix on pixel 2 xl running android 11",
            "I like that you can use any unlocked character in the journey levels and switch at any time. However, the events in the game usually do not hold my interest. I would like to see more Hans-related things, such as his alternate outfits for playable characters and his statue for a collectible to go with the other main characters."

If u add these improvements in any update then I will definitely give u ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. :-D",

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "It's great and I'm surprised it's better than I expected it to be, honestly. But... There's a problem when logging in. I have 5G and full service and a good processor in my phone, and it runs slow when trying to connect when starting up. So it's not my phone, because fortnite runs just fine and I assumed it would give me a lot of problems. But the initial start up is what's troublesome, other than that, great game.",
            "This game is fabulous however there are some problems associated with it which are needed to be fixed in order to make it better. Firstly, its greatest problem is that we enter in those MP matches which have already started, this squeezes all the fun out while playing a match, it was fine earlier but now it happens too frequently. This problem is a major setback here. And secondly, in BR matches its frame rate is a major problem, it is not as smooth as MP matches. So kindly fix this. !PEACE!",
            "The amount of content that you guys are trying push, sell, advertise is what will ultimately drive users away. Keep the design simple man. There's more menu's on this game than a PC game. Stop it. Also unbelievably huge game. It's not enough to download the game. You have to download maps, camps , weapons, modes. Just stop. I gave the game 5 stars earlier. Now it's filled with junk",
            "New updates still can't play the game. Nothing but buzz sounds and then kicks you from the game. Awful experience. Even if you wanted to play every day you can't. Don't waste your money. First experience with app was amazing. Now there is so much lag the game isn't even fun anymore. Okay haven't been able to play game because the game won't load. Just a weird noise and game shots off. Nothing but garbage!",
            "I've never experienced a mobile game so welll made as this. Truly exceptional. I think one of the greatest features of this game is that you don't need to spend money to keep up with multiplayer game play. The game rewards you for playing for free!! Which is unheard of at the level of quality this game provides IMO. I have cricket wireless, and I play about an hour and a half a day for the past week or so and I've had NO ISSUES. not only that but the game doesn't even go through that much data!"

Also, the gameplay is easy and the targets are interesting. Oh, and a voice telling how many points you get from each arrow is nicely unusual. You guys are so good, can you maybe make a variant where we shoot only at a \"professional\" type target with a # of points needed for each stage? I never gave 5 stars before to anyone.",

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

This is now the 5th time so unistalled it how many games start with 5 lives, and you win but you lose a life, not any other games I have played only this one. I usually lose a life when I ran out of moves and didn't complete it",

Now they added this stupid help others, instead of adding levels.",

If you win the game you can discover hidden layers to the game. I just ask the folks from this game to make it more of a thinking game and less random. Casino games are like that and this one is cute:) Colab with some good games and give out free stuff. I'm not included. I kick this games levels daily./Make it less like a casino slot machine and more like a thought game:) much funner:) OUCCCHHHHH my daughter told me about the money games, Make it real not fake!!! Your game is awesome I love it:) Anyway giving people good things for playing are awesome. Just don't promise 1k in a week for nothing. I love your game and will continue to play:)"

Fix the name of the song, fix the high pitch notes , and fix the speed. Other than this , still an awful app. You only get 10 coins? Maybe 20 if you get 2 crowns or something. I have to pay 100? I like some songs but thats too much of a time waster, awful app , do not install",

And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",

            "Very expensive to play. Trying to hit daily and weekly goals has cost thousands. More expensive to play than a real casino slot machine. Promotional game wiped out points with nearly 600 near-consecutive losses. The Zynga algos are geared for max losses.",
            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

There are also many glitches in this app which are a big problem. So please fix these problems other wise this is an excellent app 😊😊. It is also a really interesting and fun app. It would also be really nice if there were an option to save the video as a gif.",
            "It is good ....application but we have filters only when we download or have an account in Instagram so in that way I didn't like this application but it is very good app to make GIFs and more ...thank you for developers for developing the app ... And please make one more app that has filters...",
            "Fun but high failure rate. About 23% of the videos I made were corrupt, didn't save properly or something. Given it's a moment-in-time capture which is hard to recreate (esp of animals), that high a failure rate is terrible. Still a fun app to use, to make short videos. Would be cool if there's an option to capture longer videos and an option to save the video as a gif.",
            "Its ok, I was really hoping to free hand the placement of the pictures. Everything else is ok. Not excellent or good. Less options to choose from then expected. The option to blur out was cool but only allowed to resize the blur not pant with it. So it was tricky. Not the best but not the worst. Can tell someone has put thought into it.",
            "Just use the built-in function You can do the exact same minimal functions from the instagram app. However on here, the save feature doesnt work (continuously loads) so you can only post to feeds/stories and it doesn't allow you to choose which account to post to if you have multiple logged in. Fairly pointless when the key feature of 'pointing camera, recording in boomerang style, and saving to device gallery' doesnt work properly"

Join ringmaster Reggie and visit the Plaza to see what fun and mischief the circus has brought into town.  <br><br>We&#39;ve also made important bug fixes and improvements to the app, ensuring a smoother and uninterrupted learning experience. <br><br>The Reading Eggs Learn to Read app features hundreds of fun reading and spelling games along with over 2,500 e-books! The app includes Reading Eggs Junior, Fast Phonics, Reading Eggspress and Mathseeds. ",

            "\"CIRCUS MONTH\" .Repeatedly contacted (over 1 month) RE an account set up in another email address and 3 months worth of charges. Finally, about 5 days of investigation, where even with the transaction info...THEY couldn't find the account (which turned out to be my separated partners account on the then, family pc) ...they finally email me to say, the account has been set back up...with my email address. Had to remove PayPal and bank accounts from google/paypal to stop all access.",
            "This app really stinks. When my kid took the placement test, it placed her way out of her abilities. She was asked to parce a paragraph ( she is 5.... She can't even read yet). So she just clicks around until it lets her move on. Since we do this through school, I asked her teacher to reset her level, but she doesn't know how. So she emailed customer support and recieved NO RESPONSE. pretty crazy since you know the school is paying for it. ABC Mouse is way better and way more fun.",
            "My kid likes the app, but it constantly crashes on our Android 9. Fast Phonics, peak 3, as the level goes up, the chance of crashing increases. E.g. it took 4 attempt before finishing level 18 on peak 3. First 3 attempts, the app just crashed and went back to the home screen.",
            "There seems to be a problem using the app on my Samsung tablet - it's working ok on my samsung phone. On the tablet the games where you have to \"flick the letters up\", rather than just click on them, do not work.",
            "Hi. Love this app but have noticed that the app keeps crashing after each level is completed, I then have to close down and restart the app to then carry on to the next level"

            "Great game! A good time piece for lockdown. However... the new update rolled out today and I am on of the 1 in 5 males who suffer from colour blindness. The new darker colour scheme does not work for me. Will it stop me from playing? Probably not, though the previous version was better suited to my disability. It would be good if the developers could look at winding it back. Naturally there are a few bugs in the new version also, namely trying to play another game. It freezes on my Samsung S10",
            "Really good for the CS fans. Few bugs, about the final tally and lag in the game. Rest, still online game, it feels like AI or computer or bots playing the game. Difficulty level can be increased. Secondly, making squad and playing with friends is the issue.. We have to restart game after every match.. New update, people are hacking it easily.. They are not dying to head shots also.. Nevertheless grt game.. ❤️❤️",
            "Latest update is really bad. It has lot many bugs. Please fix all the bugs soon or Revert your code changes to previous version that was really good and stable. It is not allowing all the players to be in the game. Sometimes only 2 or 3 including CT and T. And sometimes only one player. LOL. How can we play with ourself.",
            "You have ruined the game after new upgrade.. listing down few problems.. - It's taking too much time to join the lobby and teams r not balanced after joining and sometimes no one else is joining. This is most serious problem. U hv ruined it. - Players r joining in mid of the game. - CT has also bomb after team flip..lol - No option to exit the game after joining the lobby. Many issues with UI",
            "Additive game. Critical Review: 1.sometimes don't starts properly saying network issue, despite network is perfectly ok. 2. Latest oct. Fancy UI upgrade made the game slow. Kindly make sure I was using ultra high quality video in previous version and game was working perfectly. In the recent version even high quality lags. 3. Games works at medium quality but it's very irritating for eyes. Feature Request: Add live voice intrection with others if possible."

            "I have used both paid and free photo editing apps, and I have to admit this photo editing app is absolitely Awesome in comparison to all the free and paid P.E.A. combined!! It has nothing to do with it being mosty free, which is up to you to pay, but with all the free options, I have no idea what's included with the paid version! A MUST DOWNLOAD!! ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!! Thanks so much for such an awesome Photo Editing App!! Keep up the AWESOME WORK!!",
            "besides the excessive ads and the impending fear of not being able to use the app at all (for the purpose I downloaded it for) thanks to the forceful hand of a monthly-paid membership,, this app works great. it's literally the only thing I've found where I'm able to edit moodboards the way I've been wanting to, so I thank it for that",
            "This app is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for like 2 years now. If you understand all the features (which are so many), you won't ever need any other photo editing app. It has no logos after making a collage or editing, great layouts , different sizes with ratios and options while making collage to crop , swap , delete , anything. You can choose the border or just have no borders. it's just awesome. Thanks for the app makers.",
            "Like flying for the first time. Like a pool on a hot summer day in Modesto. Like a cup of hot chocolate on Christmas. Like checking ALL the boxes on your daily to do list. Like having all the laundry folded after watching an episode of the magicians, except that towel you used to wipe your tears with. Like strawberry bingsu in loser angeles in August. Like hugging your mom. Like reaching Challenger in Starcraft. Like making before after pictures of when you finally clean. Like comment subscribe.",
            "Very nice app ...I accidentally uninstall this up and I almost cry ..good thing after searching for days I found it..this is very useful in making invitations..I just wish you add more text options, calligraphy,and color like gliter effect on text .good thing this is update new effects were add..kudos to the developer..keep up the good work."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

Daycare 3. Space theme 4. Hospital 5. School i know these already exist but they would be cool to customize. 6. Pets to the customize list 7. Clothes to the customize list. 8. Masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to the list also. I know its a lot and it doesn't effect my game if they don't exist. I love your game! Bye!",
            "This game is amazing I love it so much and it is even better with the free updates , I can not believe they are free! But talking about what is free or not,the game is only starts getting really fun when you make purchases which is not so cool. Over all amazing game it is fun and cool.I love toca boca !!! I hope who ever reads this rewiew has a long awesome life,may you find someone you love and who will cherish you forever . 🤗",
            "I would have given it five star but u can fix the bug that when we keep things in our house from somewhere else and when we reopen the game it goes back in it's original place and the full version of the game is very costly u can at least give the full game for free only for three days trail so that we can see the other places that how it is like and then buy it. But it's the best game for kids worth game.",
            "I absolutely love this game! However I think there is a bug now that they added the Halloween update. I have seen other reviews that say that the houses are total wrecks. Mine is the same. My houses I decorated have furniture just in a pile, and everything else is just purple. Purple walls, outside on the balcony is purple, the floors are purple, and I cant move anything. Please please fix this bug. I have spent a lot of birthday money on this.",
            "The game is overall good, but before I bought the misty cottage. I had an amazing world and I must have atleast spent 5 hours working on it in total. But as soon as I got the misty cottage, the game started glitching out. Early morning the next day I went on the game and my whole world reset. Now that got me upset. I wish to report this app and I want it to be reported and sorted out immediately. I have everything in the game and its around £70 for it all. Not funny at all. Sort it out please"

            "So Far Great Experience. Really IS for a toddler to learn and not too complicated for them. Very easy and definitely able to navigate with ease. My 20 month old loves building the track, the music part of playing all the instruments, and I love the options and that this was FREE. At this point wouldn't mind paying for it either. Looking for this kind of app for a long time.",
            "Just like any other app or instrument that aims at kids it lacks the crucial part of music and thats half steps. Basically if you have no knowledge of music and what that means it comes down to missing notes. You cannot play anything on this app only a select few \"happy songs\" for kids but if you're going to give your kids something to train their creativity and musical abilities go the whole way, don't limit their options",
            "This App Is Awesome! it has mini games and a lot of instruments even some adults install this piano lesson game even though it's Not For lessons, It's Very, Very! Great it functions And There Are No bugs. Those Are The Stuff I Describe. Just one problem, The music of the piano buttons doesn't match how We play the piano but i still stand for what i said . Please Creators, Make more games that are like this, But Not About instruments if you understand By-fan",
            "I was all for this game at first. So many great options and variety for all types of learners. My daughter and I loved playing this together. However I am very confused as to why there is a new \"body part\" game that has underdressed children depicted. The game has a boy in underwear and the girl in a belly shirt and underwear. This game could be done with FULLY DRESSED children shown. I find this very distasteful and will be deleting the game.",
            "my son is 16 with special needs he really likes music and I hoped that this would be easy for him. He was able and actually wanted to touch the screen to hear the music playing. While he wasn't percise with his movements this is a great cause and effect app for little ones or those like my son with limited mobility and cognitive functioning. Great app!"

            "Most questions good but not too difficult. Two annoyances are: Mini games between levels. Why? They are irrelevant to trivia. The second annoyance is that some of the tiles you are required to play are not trivia, but are simply games of chance. \"Click the chest to get more coins!\" But if you guess wrong, you lose a life...lose too many lives and the game shuts you down. This is super lame.",
            "Very entertaining. Even learning some new things so makes it worth it. Love how you have control over how hard you want the levels to be. That way its not too easy or too hard. Because when there's no level in between i usually just delete the app. It's the perfect game for me before bedtime, its the only game i've found that relaxes me and calms my brain so i can rest and my brain actually shuts off because it's tired. So yes i give 5🌟s thank you for the upload. I'll be keeping this one.",
            "I freaking love it. A bit heavy on the ads but hey, it's free. You can at least watch an ad to get another life once you run out. I don't mind dropping a little $ once I've thoroughly researched an app. Runs smooth other than ads but it's great you're not immediately forced to pay for upgrades before really getting a chance to see if it's really an app for you. Very enjoyable!!",
            "Without doubt the best quiz app out there. I have had some problems with it freezing, I managed to get to level 540 and it would not go any further no matter what I did so I have had to start again from scratch. I've now managed over 100 levels and it's only crashed once so fingers crossed I'll keep my score and history without having to start again.",
            "As games go; this one is pretty good! You only have to watch ads when you get an answer wrong. I am on level 55. Each level has approximately 15+20 questions. You have little mini-games some times. If you win those you are asked if you want to double your score by watching an ad. When you answer a question, right or wrong, it gives an explanation to the question. So you can learn something. It is a little like the original board game of Trivia Pursuit. I think it's a good game."

            "EDIT: there needs to be some kind of confirmation when spending gems. I just magically lost 25 gems and I don't know how ORIGINAL: It feels like the game is designed to keep non paying players poor. Many of the garden quests are not possible to complete without paying, and to skip them, you have to pay a month's worth of gems. The events are the same: impossible to complete without paying. The game itself is fun, I just wish they didn't make it so difficult to move forward if you don't pay",
            "Do not, I repeat do not! buy the golden pass. Its a rip off. Even though it says golden pass at each season, you can only use it for one season and then you have to repay to be able to keep using it. €5,50 is much for an option that would stay. But it's unbelieveably expensive for something that only works for one season... I either want my money back or I want to have the feature unlocked forever. Your choice Gram.",
            "Very addicting. But if i may make a suggestion on a useless feature? The screen lock is pointless, and the button is in a poor location. Having a screen lock feature on a game that requires you to move the screen doesn't make sense. But if it needs to be in the game, i suggest relocating its button. I' ve turned that thing on so many time just because an item appears in the bottom of the screen close to it. But other than that very good game",
            "I wish I could get more compasses by watching videos more often I would totally watch them to play more levels. It allows me to do it sometimes but in other games it is unlimited ad=more play, instead I have to wait a whole hour to get another compass to keep playing? That doesn't make sense. But I do love the game, it is addicting and fun to merge stuff. I just wish I could play for longer.",
            "So far a very fun game, althoughIhaven'tbeen playingbut about one week. The only downside that I have found so far is that if you want to play & collect items, you better bring your credit card to the table. The only way to get what you need and/or desire is to pay for it. All items (eggs, buildings, plants, etc) go up in price every time you expand or purchase it."

            "I like this game but I don't understand why you have to watch adds to get some clothes. It's so annoying but other than that it's a great game. I like the way you don't get the same clothes for every girl. It's fun because you can use your imagination but I really wish you could move the people around. It's ok for kids but at the start they're all in bra's!! It's cool that you can start with any girl though. So it has a good side and a bad side",
            "Hooray, this update brings a much needed feature - saving your progress. Thanks, devs! This game is enjoyable. So many possible combinations, I've played for months, and still haven't created the same girl twice. Lots of categories - skirts, pants, shorts, long shirts, short shirts, jackets, scarves, jewellery, make-up, hair and more. Plus 4 skin tones for a realistic group of girls. The best dress-up game I've downloaded, definitely worth installing!",
            "This is good enough but my opinion is that you just change the yellow girl cuz she's not my favorite but thank you and she does not have good outfits you need to make more outfits for them and please don't make them extra fancy they all go she's my favorite but she needs more good clothes",
            "Game was okay but I did have a problem with a dressing it up so I could get there while you could only dress it up and you couldn't do anything with it so that's why I gave it to just start reading but I wouldn't really recommend you couldn't get it cuz it's kind of boring.",
            "This game is excellent, fabulous, fantastic, amazing, and interesting. I love this game. I suggest you to also try rhis game to those who will see my comment and I am sure you will also love it"

            "THE best \"bubble pop\" I've played so far (about 10 which have been uninstalled). It's actually challenging at the higher levels and it took me 5 tries to get 5 stars just on level 20! Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad. But then it became clear that 3 stars for 100,000 pts and 3 stars for 300,000 pts is very significant . Not for the braindead!",

            "Its fun but not honest. There's an option where you spin to play. You can put in like $100,000 with the chance of winning $1 billion but that never happens. I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely.

            "I love this editor, it's easy to use, doesn't crash like others I have tried. The 4 instead of 5 stars is simply because of the time it takes to process the final video. Other apps for a 5 minute video takes around 5-7 minutes, this one took 30 minutes, which to me is far too long. Especially when some of my videos will be at least 15 minutes long. I'm dreading the wait on those ones.",
            "Awesome easy to use video editor! Many great features. I accessed and edited right from the videos on my Android phone! Others I tried were awkward and not as many simple to use features. Try it out and 0lay around with the music and effects , just to name two out of dozens. You'll love it! No, I don't work for the developer! Lol😁",
            "This is great app. No watermarks and excellent editing software capabilities. Easily rivals computer editing software. My only problem is there's no backspace or Ctrl+Z (however you wanna say it) so if you make a mistake, you can't undo it. Please add one and this will be my new favourite editing app. It's also user friendly! :D highly recommend",
            "I've used it once so far but it is very handy. It has variety of music and I read the option to even put your own. It allows you to add to your photos as text, transitions, music, and many other things!! What I had used was ALL FREE. Definitely recommend. There are adds but eh everything has ads now-a-days",
            "It's actually nice and user friendly specially for the ones who aren't that 'techy' . However, there was one problem that I faced which was that when you try to add any media at the starting of the video once it has been made, the whole audio that is attached to the previous media moves in front and leading to all the audios to move ahead. When you try to push the audio back it actually kind of gets trimmed."

            "I like this game so much but after the Halloween update, it looks like it needs more data and I can't play a smooth game🙁 Sometimes when I earn so much coins, suddenly it will show like 'Talking Tom Hero Dash isn't responding'. And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",

It tries to connect me with HP Web Services (which past versions never required), which then gets me an \"invalid request\" error every time. Awful, awful, awful app. Nonexistent support from HP. Avoid!",

HP falls right in line with every other technological service provider in providing unreliable service that does not function when needed and makes it impossible to get anything done. One more thing. Since app wasn't working I uninstalled and then reinstalled and now it won't connect to the printer even though its on and connected.",

This is so inconvenient especially working at home with no other access. This printer was bought to be used. Please fix the. There weew no notification sent to inform of the upgrade and any support to help with it..im so angry",

Instead this app reads like 13 different people wrote the writeups for the foods - some include nutritional values and serving sizes (formatted fairly poorly, by just listing it in sentence form rather than a table or bullet points but whatever) but many don't and just have weird grocery store-esque descriptions.

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game, and Sonic as a whole. But this \"free\" version is unacceptable. Far too many ads. This replaced the version I paid for years ago, which doesn't make any difference because the restore purchase button takes me straight to Sonic 2. Can't even find the paid version. Game 5/5, port 0/5 until restore function is fixed (this has been an issue for well over a year)",
            "It's a fantastic adaptation of the game and I would give it 5 stars if not for: - Scrap Brain zone act 2 is broken and loops back to the start of the level -- is this by design? It doesn't allow me to finish the game! - Even though I purchased the game I keep getting one add every time I open the app - I need to be online to play the game - come on man this would be amazing during long plane trips!",
            "I LOVE SONIC but this port aint the best i would rather play and emulated version and when ever i try to use debug it pauses the game i mean come on sega what the hell if this was fixed it would get a big five stars but still i love this game and i hope this bug is fixed PLEASE SEGA FIX THIS!!!!!",
            "One of the best ways to play the original Sonic the Hedgehog. Controls are surprisingly good for a phone port and widescreen definitely enhances the experience. Only problem is that achievements are a bit iffy; it says I got the chaos consiour achievement even though I only have three chaos emeralds. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.",
            "Not exactly a good experience. Saw three ads from the time I opened the game to the time I made a save & an additional two once I selected start. After the two ads, totalling over a minute, the game crashes, & process repeats. I could see enough ads I'd see from playing Sonic Forces for a week in just half an hour of trying to load a game. The controls are also really funky, making the game over twice as hard as it should. I'm disappointed, I expected better from one of my favorite franchises :/"

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. 😂 The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. 😂",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

            "This game is really really big. Many characters. Cannon and not cannon. Lots of events and free things. Amazing characters. It makes you think. Team building and a lot of fun. Only compliant is that they're things that it doesn't tell you. So you either have to look it up or learn it. Other than that it is an amazing game and if you like DragonBall I recommend it. The animation has progressed so thats something to take into consideration. If 2d is your thing definite 5*",
            "Great game and fun to play. There is a lot of potential but a few things I wish were a bit different. Drop rates for good units make it P2W friendly, but you can play completely free. There is an energy meter that I don't care for but hasn't been too hindering. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, check it out! 4/5 only because of low drop rates on a PvE game",
            "Incredible game, the animations are incredible, the artwork the detail put in the game is what has made this game my favorite game I have ever played on mobile. There is nothing that you need to add to it. Just maybe make the chances of getting an LR on a legendary banner a bit more, bc I wasted more than 1000 stones and didn't end up getting the LR I wanted. Other than that, the game is 100% without a doubt the best mobile game I ever played",
            "Genuinely one of, if not the, best mobile game. The gameplay is fun, the animation is slick, and the rates are just right. Alot of gacha games have very low or high rates, low rates cause resentment to the summons, while high rates make your accomplishments feel worthless. The characters and skills are cool, but you have to work for it. I haven't spent a dime on this game and yet I still have good units because I worked hard for them. If you haven't, play this game, you will not regret it.",
            "I've played dokkan since it came out, been through the ups and downs of it all. Played the jp version as well, and the major issue to me is that the content is just lacking. There's nothing really beyond getting the new unit and maxing it. Once you've gotten a huge box and filled out your team's it's just log in for dailys and save stones for new unit. Please dokkan, get some content in this game. I beg you. Beyond that Dragonball keeps me hype enough to keep losing storage space to it."

So you literally have to just sit there for about 1 minute everytime you play a song. So you play for like 2 min and watch an ad for 1 min.",

Also please remove some of the ads for better 👍",

            "Was a great app, but when one purchases an app outright in full, then later is asked to now pay/subscribe to use half the tools suddenly is not okay at all. I never have & never will use subscription services. If you had the option to buy a new upgraded version each year, I'd be ok with that. But to pull a \"re-pay\" stunt like that for existing customers, leads me straight to the exit on this. I will no longer be recommending this app to the vast amount of others I work with unless changed.",
            "I paid for this app in full to get the premium mode a year or so ago. Now it's asking me to pay for a new version. Go and get f***Rd. I actually loved this app and was my absolute preferred app for editing photos. You had to ruin it and get greedy shame on you. And do not bother commenting saying why don't you try the free 7 day trial... You've lost me as a customer seeya",
            "This app is trash! It just crashed on me. I unintalled. The reason I bought this app was to animate some charachters in gacha. If you plan to do that as well I do not reccomend it! Its too complex to even know how/where to use the chroma key (if there even is one), and it crashes way to easily for me. 1 star for me. Experience wasn't the best at all.",
            "EDIT: One problem is that adding an image downgrades the quality of that image a lot. REST: Honestly I think I hit the jackpot downloading this app first as an editing app. It has literally everything you could ever ask for in a photoshop app. The scene option at the very end is pretty fun to mess around with also. You can pay for premium, but that just gives you a few extra effects, atleast I think. Which means this is probably the best free editing app you can get out there right now.",
            "I used to luv this app.But when i started my subscription, the app started crashing. My subscription will end Nov 2020.Cant save an edited photo..it just keeps crashing.it's good i just subscribed for a month or else ive wasted my subscription fee for a longer period."

Only get this game if u are really desperate and have nothing else to do. Btw can people STOP moaning about ads as they r needed to keep the game free. If u care that much then dont play the game!!!!!! Duh.",
            "2 issues, ads and lag. Even with a $900 LG V60, this game lags like im playing on a slow phone from 9 years ago. Constantly dropping from a smooth 60fps to 10-15fps. Also, the ad situation is awful. This developer is great at creating a simple, creative game concept, and then ruining it with insane amounts of ads. Literally everytime you die you are faced with a 15-30 second UNSKIPPABLE ad, which happens often with the god awful lag. Which ends up making this more ad watching, than game playing.",

            "Great game. Superb quality and excellent graphics. The only thing is when you run out of balls and you are sent back to the home screen you cannot continue without the premium bonus. There should at least be 1 more free gamemode or it will get boring. If it gets boring you loose players. If you loose players it will run downhill quickly. Please improve this. If it gets improved I will rate 5. For now its 4",
            "I love this game! It's really good,time eating and fun! The graphics is just out of this world! I just don't like 2 things: 1.the fact that you have to restart the game every time from the beginning (if you don't want to buy premium) 2.when you miss only ONE crystal you lose all multiballs!(and the steps). That 2 facts are the reason I gave this game 4 stars. I would recommend this though!",
            "It's really fun and helps me focus, the music in the background and the sounds of breaking glass is also very relaxing, but one thing i noticed is when they tell you \"checkpoint saved\", sometimes it doesnt let you click on the screen or doesn't detect your fingers on the screen, if you could fix that, that would be great!👌💖",
            "It's a really nice game . N I really liked it just the thing is that u have to take a look at ur balls otherwise it does not take time to be finished 😂 Leaving this the game is perfect. If u r bored u can absolutely play it. It's the best way to time pass. If u r out u will definitely play the other But u will never b full of this game.😁 Play and enjoy the game.",
            "I love this game! The only thing i have a problem with is there's not enough levels. I passed every level, then it goes to endless mode i think it's called. Other than that it's an awesome game, very well made. Side note: i did purchase the premium version, because of how much i love this game!"

            "Started okay but the later levels are near impossible to complete given the number of explosions on the screen when you hit a ball, can't see anything and therefore can't move out of the way quick enough. Update: Having played the game for a while longer, I'm frustrated because the follow options are not working: - Being able to select \"Extra Cannon\" in the store. When selecting it it says \"Can't connect to the store, please check your connection. My connection is fine. The other 2 options in the store take a while to activate once you enter the store: - Free Heart option by watching a video - x50 diamonds by watching a video. If these options are time delayed, it would be handy to show the countdown.",
            "Too many ads. Literally 1 after every level. Plus, the game input is laggy, so your cannon is always behind where you're touching on the screen. These people suck at making video games. I hope they die of cancer. France is the worst country in the world. Only losers live there.",
            "This app is very cool & fun to play. Very challenging. As compared to other games it contains very ads. Sounds and colours also add some spice. After if you add all of this it is the perfect game I have ever played!!!. This game is also rated for all ages which I really liked about it.",
            "This game is very addictive and all of that but I gave it 3 star because once I get out of the game and I return the next day....it begins to freeze while playing and I have to keep restarting the game every time. Up until It stops and go back to normal...but like I said this is wu-an-derful...keep it up. This thing also blacks out...and to much ads",
            "It's a very hard game but addicting at the same time, since the new updates this game has wayyyyyyyyyy to many AD's. And try to find away were we can save from where we left off if we ever decide to delete the game."

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",

I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option.

Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",
            "Cant get abstract drawings. If hit to color they go to the timer & wont show at all. Cant get them back to color. This just started recently. thats why the rating is a 2. Other than that theyre a five.",
            "I love ❣️ the versatility of the options with this app. I can play with color schemes/combination: shading; changing the color selections and more. I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

An app is something that stays on your phone so i think you shldve made it a website. I am just shocked kudu ventures decided to invest like 2 million birr on this 😂like whats the bussiness plan here??",

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

This app definitely deserves more hype. Does not take as much storage as other apps and, whenever you click a pic or take a video, it saves it directly to your gallery, so you don't have to export it. I am very satisfied. Would recommend this app!",
            "B612 is really an awesome app for filters, photos, video shoots, and everything.... it has the best filters.... It is not less than \"tiktok\"... I like shooting videos but no posting... so I just shoot them on B612, with the awesome filters and music... the only think that must be improved is that the music search must be there..... And everything is really awesome... 😍😍",
            "Full support excellent application for photos and videos. A Minor thing I downloaded all the stuff in this app like effects,stickers,make ups and what not everything went good until last update. I updated B612 and guess what everything I had downloaded was gone and has to be downloaded again.And sometimes when I open the app it presents me with a blank screen and I have to restart.One more thing there are bugs and several options which wouldnt work.Like the hair colour changer for instance.",
            "I am very happy after using this app but i have rated it 4 stars cuz i got one problem. I do some editings with this app. It would have been better if there was video merging option and text writing in videos. I will rate 5 stars if this problem is fixed in the next update.",
            "Plz add separate slides for makeup..means it must be separate for lipsticks,highlight your face,blush on...when I want to highlight only MN face ,to look natural,dark coloured lipstick has been applied which is so so irritating.please consider that...if we want to only highlight face but don't want any lipstick,than what will we do? And also add good highlighters for face!"

            "What's up with this app! Every time I save a few hundred rubies and the round I'm in is coming to an end, magically the marbles roll backwards. Yeah right! I didn't ask, request, or click the icon to waste 100 rubies buying ONE fireball. Yes, I said ONE! It 's remarkable that as soon as I earn 100 or 200 rubies the marbles magically roll backwards one or two times on their own USING 100 OF MY RUBIES FOR \"ONE\" fireball. Any suggestions on how to disable the magic button?",
            "Played this game for a while. I'm currently on level 1,749 and for the past two days have been unable to collect th 30 rewards after each game. I've cleared the cache and still nothing. It's so frustrating because at these levels you need more gems to use as the levels get harder. If not working by tomorrow I will be uninstalling the game and finding something else.",
            "I enjoyed this game up to a point. Level 332 to be exact. Previous levels - albeit with different degrees of difficult - are all beatable. Not this one. I guess the game creator wants players to start buying into the gazillion of ads at level 332. Games are supposed to be fun and fairly easy, not anxiety feeders. And the ADS. Oh.my.hat. I simply cannot deal. I urge you to relook at these terrible levels and make them beatable. Until such time I will have to resign. Fix 332!",
            "How on Earth do you pass level 332…? The string is just too long. This level is unplayable. Come on guys, either fix this level or I delete.... I've been playing this level for about a month now, and I just can't get through. ALSO The angle of the shooter is too acute, almost no chance for errors About 3 updates later and still cannot beat level 332. Beginning to be a waste of time",
            "Okay. I rated the game 1 before because very intrisive ads that practically breaks the game. Ads behave better now though they cause unresponsiveness at times. The levels also seems to stay on challenging instead of impossibke. I wish there is some endless mode where we just want to play at a desired level of dificulty and not bother with anything else. Sometimes we just want to do stuff for the sake of it. No goals, no agenda. Just doing it for its own sake."

            "Skeptical before downloading because of all the negative reviews mostly based off excessive ads - despite enjoying the first version years ago. However, this FREE game delivers exactly what it describes. Yes, when you don't answer a question correctly an add does appear, but so be it? It's a trivia game - an add is a fair trade for incorrectly answering a question. Great game if you aren't too impatient to watch an add everytime you don't know the right answer.",
            "This game is fun, but on Rescue Rush you can only do a catagory for so long. So I would appreciate if you could change that to where you can do the catagory until you want to change it. Also, can you please add more catagories on the rescue rush game? There are also too many adds... other than that this game is really fun and I would recommend you to get it😊",
            "Get rid of the 3 part ads that require you to continously hit continue just to get out of them its b.s.! Also, I am loving the fact you shove ads in my face every 2 minutes but, somehow when I try to watch an ad on purpose somehow they are not available all of the sudden. My interest is waning.",
            "On Pixel 2 with Android 11. When I start the app, enter my email, I see the input for my password. I click on it, but my keyboard doesn't pop up. This is a bug that should be fixed. I have encountered this in two phones, both using Android 11.",
            "You give the same consistent answer every time someone mentions TOO MANY ADS in their comments or ratings on this game. I do enjoy the game itself. Definitely tests your knowledge but there's an ad for literally every single feature and that's probably the most annoying thing ever with any kind of game. This could be the best game ever and I'd spend all my free time playing ACCEPT the ads being there, trumps all of that. Sad really!!"

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

            "I used to enjoy the app, and was getting pretty good with my skill level, then out of nowhere the app started acting glitchy and periodically freezing up right in the middle of a song, and the notes became unresponsive to the touch, and would score you as though your timing was off and you missed them as they came in line with the keys and the intended time to strike or tap them. It's extremely frustrating to be scored so low when it's not a low skill set, but a buggy app causing it. Please fix",

            "Can you Add lines at the aimer when you zoom in on a target its very annoying when you forget what range you hit the target at then you have too waste shells just to find him. Heres something else can you update the damge to the tanks its annoying when i shoot a panther with a 76 gun to its side 5 times for it to die or worse i shoot it multiple times and then he shoots me and then i die in just two shots. One more thing can you add where you can repair you tank if it gets damaged and crew too.",
            "Love this game. Has great updates and I like how you can control wether or not friendlys can attack or not. Great job. Keep up the great work. 😉. The only thing I don't like Is why do I need internet to play dual or campaign.",
            "Why do we have to watch ads to get coins? Add levels and award coins so we can get special tanks. All else is good the above prob. gets you down to 3 stars",
            "You should add more tank Destroyers for the countries also you should add different camo skins we could put on tanks add the panzerkampfwagen E-100,Is3,mäus,m46 pershing, ALSO add tge panzerkampfwagen waffenträgger. Place the pak44 on a panther hull make it a 6 shot burst the a 30 second reload!"

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

More users, followers are definitely going to depend on this app if these helpful features are introduced. Thank you - - Uday Kulkarni.",
            "Truely awesome. Well done. Only one problem is there that you can directly select a file and open it from Fast Scan. You have scroll alot images to get your needed image selected. Must provide selecting images from gallery/other apps in different ways. Thank You. Good Luck. 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",
            "Is this a joke? You put free in title and give only 3 days free and ask to pay. I don't mind you asking for price but instead you put it on the free store and asking to pay after download. Move your app to the paid store. Edit : Google asks for adding cards to get paid automatically after 3 days. Bug or intended I don't know.",
            "I liked the app very much. But for some reason, after cropping and aligning it outputs files of very poor quality (low resolution and extreme compression artifacts), which makes them barely readable at times, even though I have put the quality options for both images and PDFs all the way to the max in the app settings and my input files are high res sharp photos. Do I have to purchase the app in order to get a good output quality?",
            "Excellent app. Super great. Saved me a lot of time and money. Thank you FASTSCAN team."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."
