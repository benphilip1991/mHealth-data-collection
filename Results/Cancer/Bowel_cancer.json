        "description": "How long is the human colon?\r\nThe human large intestine (colon) is about 6 feet long.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is colorectal cancer?\r\nCancers of the colon and rectum (colorectal cancer) start when the process of the normal replacement of colon lining cells goes awry. Mistakes in cell division occur frequently. For reasons that are poorly understood, sometimes mistakes occur that escape our editing systems. When this occurs, these cells begin to divide independently of the normal checks and balances that control growth. As these abnormal cells grow and divide, they can lead to growths within the colon called polyps. Polyps vary in type, but many are precancerous tumors that grow slowly over the course of years and do not spread. As polyps grow, additional genetic mutations further destabilize the cells. When these precancerous tumors change direction (growing into the wall of the tube rather than into the space in the middle of it) and invade other layers of the large intestine (such as the submucosa or muscular layer), the precancerous polyp has become cancerous. In most cases this process is slow, taking at least eight to 10 years to develop from those early aberrant cells to a frank cancer.\r\n\r\nOnce a colorectal cancer forms, it begins to grow in two ways. First, the cancer can grow locally and extend through the wall of the intestine and invade adjacent structures, making the mass (called the primary tumor) more of a problem and harder to remove. Local extension can cause additional symptoms such as pain or fullness, perforation of the colon, or blockages of the colon or nearby structures. Second, as the cancer grows it begins the process of metastasis, shedding thousands of cells a day into the blood and lymphatic system that can cause cancers to form in distant locations. Colorectal cancers most commonly spread first to local lymph nodes before traveling to distant organs. Once local lymph nodes are involved, spread to the liver, the abdominal cavity, and the lung are the next most common destinations of metastatic spread.\r\n\r\nColorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer in the U.S. in both men and women. It affects almost 135,000 people annually, representing 8% of all cancers.

Il est dû à la multiplication non contrôlée et la mutation de cellules du corps qui finissent par former une tumeur. \r\n\r\nLe plus souvent la cause est inconnue.

On parle alors de métastases. Si le cancer s’étend à plusieurs organes, il s’agit d’un cancer généralisé. \r\n\r\nLe nombre de cancers détectés augmente grâce au perfectionnement des techniques de dépistage ce qui permet une prise en charge plus rapide et de plus grandes chances de guérison.\r\n\r\nLe plus souvent les symptômes d’un cancer sont inexistants. Mais on peut observer : \r\n- Une toux persistante, du sang dans les crachats (cancer du poumon)\r\n- Une voix inhabituellement rauque (cancer de la gorge ou du poumon)\r\n- Des problèmes digestifs persistants (cancer colorectal ou du pancréas)\r\n- Des difficultés à avaler (cancer de l’œsophage)\r\n- Une modification du transit : diarrhée, constipation, sang dans les selles (cancer colorectal)\r\n- Du sang dans les urines (cancer du rein ou de la vessie)\r\n- Une grosseur inhabituelle dans le sein (cancer du sein)\r\n\r\nUne palpation, une analyse de sang, une échographie, une radio ou une IRM peuvent permettre de déceler une tumeur.

Results are displayed for 10-, 20- and 30-year timeframes, with a subdivision in anatomical or pathological subtypes if possible.\r\n\r\nThis application has the CE conformity mark as a medical device with a low risk. As such, we have followed the Class I conformity assessment procedures as described in Annex VII Module A, EC Declaration of Conformity. As it it is considered a medical device that poses minimal risk to patients and consumers, it falls under the FDA exercise enforcement discretions. For more information, please visit the relevant section the official FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/mobile-medical-applications/examples-mobile-apps-which-fda-will-exercise-enforcement-discretion\r\n\r\nTo use this application, create an account and enter the requested information in the different tabs as accurately and completely as you can. All information that is requested will influence your risk for at least one type of cancer, so the more complete and accurate the information you enter, the more dependable the results. Age, gender and racial background are critical, all other information is optional. The results will appear after you have completed the last tab and can always be revisited by tapping your name. You can also edit the information you submitted to see how this influences your results.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime probabilities of developing cancers were based on USA data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, collected since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), collected since 1995. These figures were adapted by the hazard ratios available in the published peer-reviewed literature. Only risk factors with a quantifiable risk were included. Risk factors requiring complex tests not available to the average clinician were excluded. Meta-analyses were given preference when available.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This application is strictly educational and all information contained herein cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician. The evaluations presented represent our best efforts to conveniently assess cancer risk. However, as significant controversy and widely different study results can persist around the impact of even a single variable in a strictly selected population, this is based on a large number of assumptions, extrapolations and estimates. As not every study includes a multivariate analysis and the effect of some risk factors on certain cancers is so large their effect cannot be eliminated from basic probability, a bias toward overestimation of risk is possible. Furthermore, there is continuous progress in the scientific literature. Any figures should therefore be regarded as indicative, but not precise.\r\nAny information you enter into this application will only be stored on your device and will never be sent to us or to any other party, for any reason.\r\n\r\nAll research and medical support for this application was done by Dr. Philippe Westerlinck, radiation oncologist and clinical chair at the University Hospital of Liège, superspecialising in gastro-intestinal, lung and breast cancers.",

All information that is requested will influence your risk for at least one type of cancer, so the more complete and accurate the information you enter, the more dependable the results. Age, gender and racial background are critical, all other information is optional. The results will appear after you have completed the last tab and can always be revisited by tapping your name. You can also edit the information you submitted to see how this influences your results.<br><br>The lifetime probabilities of developing cancers were based on USA data from the National Cancer Institute&#39;s (NCI&#39;s) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, collected since 1973 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#39;s (CDC&#39;s) National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), collected since 1995. These figures were adapted by the hazard ratios available in the published peer-reviewed literature. Only risk factors with a quantifiable risk were included. Risk factors requiring complex tests not available to the average clinician were excluded. Meta-analyses were given preference when available.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: This application is strictly educational and all information contained herein cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician. The evaluations presented represent our best efforts to conveniently assess cancer risk. However, as significant controversy and widely different study results can persist around the impact of even a single variable in a strictly selected population, this is based on a large number of assumptions, extrapolations and estimates. As not every study includes a multivariate analysis and the effect of some risk factors on certain cancers is so large their effect cannot be eliminated from basic probability, a bias toward overestimation of risk is possible. Furthermore, there is continuous progress in the scientific literature. Any figures should therefore be regarded as indicative, but not precise.<br>Any information you enter into this application will only be stored on your device and will never be sent to us or to any other party, for any reason.<br><br>All research and medical support for this application was done by Dr. Philippe Westerlinck, radiation oncologist and clinical chair at the University Hospital of Liège, superspecialising in gastro-intestinal, lung and breast cancers.",

        "description": "Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass. The stool is often hard and dry. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. Constipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.",

These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.\r\n\r\nTobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% are due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests.

        "description": "Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and a number of hormones. There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting. The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and heavy alcohol use. Other causes include direct trauma, certain medications, infections such as mumps, and tumors among others. Chronic pancreatitis may develop as a result of acute pancreatitis. It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use. Other causes include high levels of blood fats, high blood calcium, some medications, and certain genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis among others. Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase. In chronic pancreatitis these tests may be normal. Medical imaging such as ultrasound and CT scan may also be useful.",

Smoking increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either amylase or lipase. In chronic pancreatitis these tests may be normal. Medical imaging such as ultrasound and CT scan may also be useful.",

Because there are more sensitive nerves in this part of the body, they are normally more painful. Straining when passing a stool may cause them to bleed. If you have external hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nAnal itching\r\nOne or more hard, tender lumps near your anus\r\nAnal ache or pain, especially when sitting\r\nToo much straining, rubbing, or cleaning around your anus may make your symptoms worse. For many people, the symptoms of external hemorrhoids go away within a few days.\r\n\r\nInternal Hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids are deep inside the rectum and not visible from outside. They are normally painless. Often, the first sign that internal hemorrhoids are present is rectal bleeding. If you have internal hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nBleeding from your rectum - bright red blood on stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement\r\n\r\n\r\n========\r\nSymptoms\r\n========\r\n\r\nHemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal and anal complaints. The most common complaint symptoms are:\r\n\r\n1) Painless bleeding from the anal area,\r\n2) Anal itching,\r\n3) Pain in the anal area,\r\n4) Swelling and feeling a lump at the anus are all associated with an inflamed hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nThese include bleeding from ulcers, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tumors. If rectal bleeding occurs, it is important to contact your health care professional or seek emergency medical care. \r\n\r\nThis is especially important if the person is taking blood thinning medications.\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nWith internal hemorrhoids, you may see bright red streaks of blood on toilet paper or bright red blood in the toilet bowl after you have a normal bowel movement. You may see blood on the surface of the stool.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids can get irritated and clot under the skin, causing a hard painful lump. This is called a thrombosed, or clotted, hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by \"regular skin\" and have pain fibers associated with them. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid occurs when an underlying vein within the hemorrhoid clots off causing intense pain from the rapid stretching of the skin covering the hemorrhoid. \r\n\r\n\r\n*** Please Rate this APP and leave your reply and valuable suggestions to improve this app***",

Because there are more sensitive nerves in this part of the body, they are normally more painful. Straining when passing a stool may cause them to bleed. If you have external hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nAnal itching\r\nOne or more hard, tender lumps near your anus\r\nAnal ache or pain, especially when sitting\r\nToo much straining, rubbing, or cleaning around your anus may make your symptoms worse. For many people, the symptoms of external hemorrhoids go away within a few days.\r\n\r\nInternal Hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids are deep inside the rectum and not visible from outside. They are normally painless. Often, the first sign that internal hemorrhoids are present is rectal bleeding. If you have internal hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nBleeding from your rectum - bright red blood on stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement\r\n\r\n\r\n========\r\nSymptoms\r\n========\r\n\r\nHemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal and anal complaints. The most common complaint symptoms are:\r\n\r\n1) Painless bleeding from the anal area,\r\n2) Anal itching,\r\n3) Pain in the anal area,\r\n4) Swelling and feeling a lump at the anus are all associated with an inflamed hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nThese include bleeding from ulcers, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tumors. If rectal bleeding occurs, it is important to contact your health care professional or seek emergency medical care. \r\n\r\nThis is especially important if the person is taking blood thinning medications.\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nWith internal hemorrhoids, you may see bright red streaks of blood on toilet paper or bright red blood in the toilet bowl after you have a normal bowel movement. You may see blood on the surface of the stool.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids can get irritated and clot under the skin, causing a hard painful lump. This is called a thrombosed, or clotted, hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by \"regular skin\" and have pain fibers associated with them. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid occurs when an underlying vein within the hemorrhoid clots off causing intense pain from the rapid stretching of the skin covering the hemorrhoid. \r\n\r\n\r\n*** Please Rate this APP and leave your reply and valuable suggestions to improve this app***",

        "title": "Simple Ways to Prevent Cancer",
        "description": "Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells anywhere in a body. These abnormal cells are termed cancer cells, malignant cells, or tumor cells. These cells can infiltrate normal body tissues. Many cancers and the abnormal cells that compose the cancer tissue are further identified by the name of the tissue that the abnormal cells originated from (for example, breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer).\r\n\r\n Cancer is not confined to humans; animals and other living organisms can get cancer. Below is a schematic that shows normal cell division and how when a cell is damaged or altered without repair to its system, the cell usually dies. Also shown is what occurs when such damaged or unrepaired cells do not die and become cancer cells and show uncontrolled division and growth -- a mass of cancer cells develop.\r\n\r\n Frequently, cancer cells can break away from this original mass of cells, travel through the blood and lymph systems, and lodge in other organs where they can again repeat the uncontrolled growth cycle. This process of cancer cells leaving an area and growing in another body area is termed metastatic spread or metastasis. For example, if breast cancer cells spread to a bone, it means that the individual has metastatic breast cancer to bone.

        "descriptionHTML": "Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells anywhere in a body. These abnormal cells are termed cancer cells, malignant cells, or tumor cells. These cells can infiltrate normal body tissues. Many cancers and the abnormal cells that compose the cancer tissue are further identified by the name of the tissue that the abnormal cells originated from (for example, breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer).<br><br> Cancer is not confined to humans; animals and other living organisms can get cancer. Below is a schematic that shows normal cell division and how when a cell is damaged or altered without repair to its system, the cell usually dies. Also shown is what occurs when such damaged or unrepaired cells do not die and become cancer cells and show uncontrolled division and growth -- a mass of cancer cells develop.<br><br> Frequently, cancer cells can break away from this original mass of cells, travel through the blood and lymph systems, and lodge in other organs where they can again repeat the uncontrolled growth cycle. This process of cancer cells leaving an area and growing in another body area is termed metastatic spread or metastasis. For example, if breast cancer cells spread to a bone, it means that the individual has metastatic breast cancer to bone. This is not the same as &quot;bone cancer,&quot; which would mean the cancer had started in the bone.<br><br>Please do consider leaving a positive review and rating the App 5 star Thank you",

        "description": "Soursop also known as \"Guyabano\" is a fruit that comes from the Graviola tree. Other names for soursop such as Pawpaw (in Brazil);Guanábana (Spanish), Africa and Southeast Asia; Graviola (Portuguese), Guyabano ( Philippines), and Custard Apple (English). The scientific name is Annona Muricata. The graviola tree grows in warm tropical areas such as the Philippines, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it has superfruit-healing properties as a high-antioxidant food due to its vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorous and even some iron that it contains. These vitamins and minerals are why soursop benefits include potentially helping reduce eye disease, treat infections and potentially even fight cancer, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown as a sedative, a nerve tonic, and used to maintain proper intestinal health, guyabano is just one medicinal tool stemming from the graviola tree. Throughout history, each part of the graviola tree, such as the bark, leaves, roots, fruit, and seeds have been used for medicinal purposes. The seeds have been used to treat nausea and vomiting, while herbal medicine practitioners recommend using the fruit and leaves to relieve stomach distress, pain, cough, asthma, and fever.\r\n\r\nA well-known fruit all over the world, the soursop's delicious white pulp, with tones of fruit candy and smooth cream is commonplace in tropical markets, but is rarely found fresh anywhere else. The graviola tree, or Annona  Muricata, produces the sweet soursop fruit, also called custard apple, paw paw or, in many Spanish speaking countries, guanabana. \r\n\r\nWhile the fruit is not as well known as others and is less researched, soursop health benefits are still worthy of note. soursop fruit is so delicious with a sharp aroma and a sweet-sour taste which is basically a combination of the taste of pineapple and strawberry. \r\n\r\nRecently, it has gained attention and popularity due to its natural cancer cell killing properties. There are also various uses of soursop apart from its anti- cancer properties. They have the Acetoginin containing compounds namely bulatacin, asimisin and squamosin. Acetoginin acts as an anti- feedent. Thus, they are often used in killing insects and pests which die by consuming these leaves even in small amounts. Scientific research conducted by The National Cancer Institute has proved that Soursop leaves can effectively attack and destroy cancer cells. In addition to this, they are also used in the treatment of several other diseases. \r\n\r\nThe App Features\r\n- About and origins of Soursop Superfruit.\r\n- Medical research on Soursop content to the human health.\r\n- The Top Benefits of Soursop including as an anti cancer superfruit.\r\n- Precautions and side effect of overdose soursop\r\n- and simple and easy to follow step by step recipes for soursop",

        "description": "The human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A Fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

        "description": "¿Qué es el estreñimiento?\r\n\r\nEl estreñimiento significa una complicación a un nivel diferente dependiendo de la persona. Para muchas personas, esto simplemente significa evacuaciones intestinales poco frecuentes (heces). Para otros, sin embargo, esto significa heces duras, dificultad para evacuarlas (esfuerzo) o una sensación de evacuación incompleta después de una evacuación intestinal. La causa de cada uno de estos síntomas de estreñimiento varía, por lo que el enfoque de cada persona debe adaptarse a cada paciente específico.\r\n\r\nEl estreñimiento también puede alternar con diarrea. Este patrón a menudo ocurre en el síndrome del intestino irritable (SII). Al final del espectro, hablamos de impactación fecal, que es cuando las heces se endurecen en el recto e impiden el paso (aunque a veces la diarrea puede ocurrir incluso con obstrucción debido a una fuga de líquido cólico alrededor de las heces afectadas).\r\n\r\nEl número de evacuaciones intestinales generalmente disminuye con la edad. La mayoría de los adultos tienen lo que se considera normal, entre tres y 21 veces por semana. El patrón más común es un movimiento de arco por día, pero este patrón se observa en menos de la mitad de los individuos. Además, la mayoría son irregulares y no tienen deposiciones todos los días o el mismo número todos los días.\r\n\r\nDesde un punto de vista médico, el estreñimiento se define generalmente como menos de tres evacuaciones intestinales por semana. El estreñimiento severo se define como menos de una comisión por semana. No hay razón médica para tener una silla de montar todos los días. No tener uno durante dos o tres días no causa malestar físico, sólo angustia mental (en algunas personas). Contrariamente a la creencia popular, no hay evidencia de que las “toxinas” se acumulen cuando el movimiento es infrecuente o el estreñimiento conduce al cáncer. Pero entonces, ¿qué hacer en caso de estreñimiento?\r\n\r\nEs importante distinguir entre estreñimiento agudo (de aparición reciente) y estreñimiento crónico (de larga duración).\r\n\r\nEl estreñimiento agudo requiere una evaluación urgente porque una afección médica grave puede ser la causa subyacente (por ejemplo, tumores de colon). También requiere evaluación inmediata si está acompañada de síntomas como sangrado rectal, dolor y calambres abdominales, náuseas y vómitos, y pérdida involuntaria de peso.\r\nLa evaluación del estreñimiento crónico puede no ser urgente, especialmente si las medidas simples proporcionan alivio.\r\n\r\n¿Cuándo hablamos de estreñimiento crónico?\r\nEl estreñimiento crónico es una defecación poco frecuente o una evacuación intestinal difícil que dura varias semanas o más.\r\n\r\nEl estreñimiento generalmente se describe como tener menos de tres evacuaciones intestinales por semana.\r\n\r\nAunque el estreñimiento ocasional es muy común, algunas personas sufren de estreñimiento crónico que puede afectar su capacidad para realizar sus tareas diarias. El estreñimiento crónico también puede causar esfuerzos excesivos para tener evacuaciones intestinales y otros signos y síntomas.\r\n\r\nEl tratamiento y las curas para el estreñimiento crónico dependen en parte de la causa subyacente. Sin embargo, en algunos casos, una causa nunca se encuentra… pero siempre es posible hacer algo para tratar los síntomas!",

        "description": "Every civilization defines, views and applies its Home Remedies differently. Historic cookbooks are frequently full of remedies for dyspepsia, fevers, and female complaints. Home remedies may or may not have medicinal properties that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons.

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

        "description": "Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion.",

        "description": "You've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\nYou've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\n\r\n1. Don't use tobacco\r\nUsing any type of tobacco puts you on a collision course with cancer. Smoking has been linked to various types of cancer — including cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, larynx, pancreas, bladder, cervix and kidney. Chewing tobacco has been linked to cancer of the oral cavity and pancreas. Even if you don't use tobacco, exposure to secondhand smoke might increase your risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAvoiding tobacco — or deciding to stop using it — is an important part of cancer prevention. If you need help quitting tobacco, ask your doctor about stop-smoking products and other strategies for quitting.\r\n\r\n2. Eat a healthy diet\r\nAlthough making healthy selections at the grocery store and at mealtime can't guarantee cancer prevention, it might reduce your risk. Consider these guidelines:\r\n\r\nEat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Base your diet on fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant sources — such as whole grains and beans.\r\nAvoid obesity. Eat lighter and leaner by choosing fewer high-calorie foods, including refined sugars and fat from animal sources.\r\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, do so only in moderation The risk of various types of cancer — including cancer of the breast, colon, lung, kidney, and liver — increases with the amount of alcohol you drink and the length of time you've been drinking regularly.\r\nLimit processed meats. A report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, concluded that eating large amounts of processed meat can slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancer.\r\nIn addition, women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts might have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active\r\nMaintaining a healthy weight might lower the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon, and kidney.\r\n\r\nPhysical activity counts, too. In addition to helping you control your weight, physical activity on its own might lower the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.\r\n\r\nAdults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits. But for substantial health benefits, strive to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. You can also do a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine — and if you can do more, even better.\r\n\r\nKeywords:-\r\n\r\n1. Cancer\r\n2. Medical\r\n3.

        "description": "Use this app to learn about the symptoms of HIV and more about the virus\r\n\r\nWhat is HIV?\r\n\r\nHIV is a virus that damages the immune system. The immune system helps the body fight off infections. Untreated HIV infects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cells. Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of infections and cancers. \r\n\r\nHIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:\r\n\r\n    blood\r\n    semen\r\n    vaginal and rectal fluids\r\n    breast milk\r\n\r\nThe virus doesn’t spread in air or water, or through casual contact.\r\n\r\nStages of HIV\r\n\r\n    stage 1: acute stage, the first few weeks after transmission\r\n    stage 2: clinical latency, or chronic stage\r\n    stage 3: AIDS\r\n\r\nHIV is a lifelong condition and currently there is no cure, although many scientists are working to find one. However, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.\r\n\r\nWithout treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called AIDS. At that point, the immune system is too weak to fight off other diseases and infections. Untreated, life expectancy with AIDS is about three years Trusted Source. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-controlled and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.\r\n\r\nIt’s estimated that 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 5 don’t know they have the virus.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top 20 countries with people living with Hiv\r\n\r\nSwaziland\r\nLesotho\r\nBotswana\r\nSouth Africa\r\nNamibia\r\nZimbabwe\r\nZambia\r\nMozambique\r\nMalawi\r\nUganda\r\nEquatorial Guinea\r\nKenya\r\nTanzania\r\nCentral African Republic\r\nCameroon\r\nGabon\r\nBahamas, \r\nThe\tCongo, \r\nRepublic of the Guinea-Bissau\r\nRwanda\r\n\r\nHIV can cause changes throughout the body. Learn about the effects of HIV on the different systems in the body.\r\n\r\n What is AIDS?\r\n\r\nAIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean they’ll develop AIDS.\r\n\r\nHIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below 200 per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.\r\n\r\nA person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an opportunistic infection or cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV. An opportunistic infection, such as pneumonia, is one that takes advantage of a unique situation, such as HIV.\r\n\r\nUntreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about three years Trusted Source. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.\r\n\r\nIf AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised. It’s weakened to the point where it can no longer fight off most diseases and infections. That makes the person vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:\r\n\r\n    pneumonia\r\n    tuberculosis\r\n    oral thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth or throat\r\n    cytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus\r\n    cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection in the brain\r\n    toxoplasmosis, a brain infection caused by a parasite\r\n    cryptosporidiosis, an infection caused by an intestinal parasite\r\n    cancer, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma\r\n\r\nThe shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it’s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS.

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",
            "Some of the fonts in other apps have change to outline after using this spp. I like help but not unnecessary changes. It is hard to read outline words. Hope you can look into this matter. Will things be back to normal should I uninstall this app.",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

I'm not saying that this problem is on you guys end but, when it logs me out of an online match I lose money each time and can't get it back. I enter these online matches to get more virtual currency but when I'm getting logged out I can do that. So basically I'm losing money and can't gain it.",

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "I've been using this app for years now, it's absolutely brilliant I love it and I would recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a better system for their files than the one pre installed on their phone. All in all, get this app installed on your phone now, it'll be the best move you make all day... You can upload files to your Dropbox account directly from within the app also to Google Drive, plus you can also upload directly to your website from the app too. Plus there's 5GB free storage",
            "The app had always been my go to File Manager since I can remember. But, I get it!! I am not on Premium. The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable. But now, after every one or less that five actions and there comes a pop-up to buy the Premium and an ad thereafter? Will I get any work done on it surely? It's annoying and a waste of the users time!!"

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. 😂 The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. 😂",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

Also, and this has happened more than 3 times, it would say I still have to hit a few more cans but there are no cans left to hit. Please fix this. It's very frustrating esp for the harder levels when you're so close to winning.",
            "There are alot of ads running and is very pathetic.. Its like not playing the game but watching the ads.. As i have downloaded it just to watch the ads. Not Worst but it is more then that..",
            "You guys need to fix the bug I'm on level 91 and everytime I get all the cans down the counter still saying that there are still cans left to knock down and there isn't fix it",

            "I really have nothing else to say. The app is a lost cause. I made a point many years ago when the app was first launched about the app kept messing up the syncing process between the quantity or record of a wine entry with the record at the database server. This problem was never fixed! Today I found the same error with the quantity of a wine I have just couple days ago, and I found the quantity of the wine was unchanged. Can u trust a tech company can't even get its database syncing right?",
            "This should allow two ratings. For looking up wines and getting descriptions and reviews, this app is great. You can even take a photo of the label and most of the time it'll find it. This has kept me away from accidentally buying sweet wines (not my gig). Love it for this use. Then I used Vivino for ordering wine - I have done it twice. Once the order was placed and weeks later it didn't ship. No notice why or if it would be shipped. Cancelled that. Later I tried again, ordering a case of one of my go-to wines from a different sub-retailer in Vivino. The order was shipped in a very reasonable time this order, but upon opening it they had substituted for the entire case with a different wine. No warning, just did it. Were it one bottle, I would be (only) ok with this, but for a case, without warning, this is unacceptable. The thing that has ended my ordering on Vivino is that, having had this happen, I can't get Vivino to even answer an email or respond to the 'contact' tab on their site. I frankly don't know if anyone works there anymore, certainly nobody is manning the email address or contact input. I have reached out both ways for the third time today and will be calling the credit card to have the charges reversed.",
            "Why only 4 stars?! The application is good, pretty sure I'll use it for several times, but the 1st thing I noticed, that the tutorial after the \"see how it works\" button is completely unreadable (at least for me it is..). Light brownish background with small grey text. Please take into consideration to change it. :)",
            "Love it and recommend it often. It's a great way to broaden your palette. I've tried so many new wines based on a decent rating and generally been happy I did. Also helped me to avoid a few bad ones.",
            "Used to be a good app, but now it's just annoying when it takes over your screen to install a non-existent update, that usually comes along a week after the first red screen appears. Suggestions to remove the annoyance have gone unheard (contacted via the app)"

I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

            "This app is great with helping to clean files and monitoring apps using up your battery and/or memory. I have only had them for about a week now."

Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

            "The extra filters keep disappearing after a couple of weeks or so. I am fed up with constantly having to reinstall them. Am uninstalling. Haven't the time or patience. A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

(we are able to share only one document at a time from the app.) And next point is 2. give us an option to reorder the pages and mark the number on the page. 3.if we select one filter for an image, it should automatically select the same filter from next time.",
            "I like this app, it's the best scanner and really easy to organise. I didn't give full stars because there isn't an option to edit the name, or edit the documents. Like scan a few more, or delete a few once you have saved it onto the device. If I make a mistake I have to rescan everything. Nonetheless, I am still using this app because there are no ads and it's a quality scanner!",
            "It's a nice app, especially if you have an outlook account. When you save it, it saves directly to your account after you log in once, and you can also choose what to save it as (pdf, jpeg, etc. . .). The only thing is, if you have bad lighting, sometimes the scanner won't pick up the edges of your paper. Which is a given for any scanner, but if you're in a rush it can cost you time. It doesn't have pop up ads like some other scanners I've used so that's also a plus.",
            "This is an amzing app. If we click a photo for scanning from any angle, it automatically makes the photo clear and straight. I could have given 5 stars to this app, if there could be one more feature in it. Today I had to scan the images of my test paper and by mistake, I forgot one page to scan. So I scanned it at the last thinking that *there will be an option to reorder the pages in a correct format*. But I wasnt able to reorder. Please add page reordering feature in this app. Thank you.😊",
            "I couldn't find a proper pdf creator and was in desperate need of one due to my exams. Them I found this and I am so very grateful that I did. Works just fine and captures the document from whichever angle I click. Only one thing, today I forgot to rename the file before saving it. And then I couldn't find any option to rename it. So I had to click the pictures of the pages again. If there is a renaming option, please help me find it but if not, that's an improvement you must make."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

Upgrades like guns, bullets and so on are not more than a kind of a placebo. Try yourself and compare it by playing a minigame using different stuff. I have fired more than 50k real bullets up to distances of 300 meters in my life and even in hard wind. I never experienced such a wind effect, not a 2 ms and not at 4 ms not even with a muzzle loader rifle.",

No darn ads... UDATE: Spent coin on an upgrade, then next time I went in, the upgrade was not available. It was like I never bought it! And I lost all that coin too!

It wasn't hard each game is seconds long and easy probably even to easy for her skill level. When we got to level 218 that was it all it did was repeat the same game over and over it didn't even reset to level one so you could play again. It did repeat many games.",
            "This game is absolutely amazing, I had a great experience playing this with my friends. Life changing I'm now married and have 3 kids because of this game",
            "Funny thing about this thing I worry about distance from the round table or the one that I have a great example for me a min and I have a good idea of what is going on in my computer though and i'm still trying to find a way out for your English papers to be there for dinner somemore but I think that u are not assessed.",
            "Not very fun. The game looks super gross and way too many adds.please fix this asap. The game is also very discusting. The add looked fun but l read other comments and said the same thing. I got it to see if it was true and it was true. So read other comments before getting the game. The game people told someone that if they hate all the adds and get the v.i.p. which you have to pay monthly. this game is really bad for younger kids. the game also glitches really badly so just saying. Not a fan!!",
            "I find this game okay, I guess. It's just the ads that really ruin the experience for me. You get an ad every level, and each level takes less time than the ad you receive after."

            "Ridiculous to limit the number of words look up to ONE per day, the app was available for 150INR and is now charged at 800INR/year, very very greedy. Time to uninstall... Hundreds of other options are available . Goodbye Greedy developers. We don't want your service for free and offcourse you were making money from the advertisements, it should be priced at a reasonable price. The earlier One time payment of 150INR to 800INR/year is not justifiable pricing, kindly stop giving lame responses.",
            "Frustrating. Loved the app and used it regularly until the one word limit. Can understand the need for funding but the sudden change is a massive bummer. Have large collections and can't even see the definitions of the words I've stared. Should be free to revisit words I've already saved with 1 limit to new words. The drastic change from unlimited to one word a day is awful. If you do nothing else then change the app description because none of this is free.",
            "Their most recent update made the free version unusable. You can only look up one word a day, unless you pay $10/year. They changed their set up so that they could make more money off of users, but hopefully they'll realize soon they're only lossing money this way and go back to ads. If that happens I'll come back and they'll make money off me again. But really, like everyone else who uses this dictionary I have it out of convenience, I can just Google a word and look it up that way instead.",
            "How disappointing that this app lets users look up ONLY 1 WORD PER DAY all of a sudden! For years, I'd have rated it 5 stars. I was able to look up unlimited words while my device was connected to the internet provided I watched occasional adverts. Also, it used to cost a one-off payment of £9.99 for ad-free access, but now it costs £18.49 per year for any access whatsoever! I own a hard copy of the OED and have it free on my Mac, so this app was purely for convenience. I shall uninstall it now.",
            "I am seriously disappointed by the single word per day. I hate to see this happening, I thought that shouldn't install the third party dictionaries because they may be unauthentic. But, I think I would prefer those than this app. I would prefer to the devs myself that they should at least add a ten words per day policy. That would be much better"

Before that we gets not only stars but also something like 🎀 ribbons. After failing the challenge there is no backup which demotivate player. The game mode story I didn't like at all and challenges are so easy. In the game now the time has came to give some videos otherwise game Will be so much boring. Mission is getting difficult to complete.",

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "I shot archery for real when I was young and my back was good. So far, this is my favourite app for archery. I like the shortness of the ads; you are not greedy! Also, the gameplay is easy and the targets are interesting. Oh, and a voice telling how many points you get from each arrow is nicely unusual. You guys are so good, can you maybe make a variant where we shoot only at a \"professional\" type target with a # of points needed for each stage? I never gave 5 stars before to anyone.",
            "Love the game. Hate the glitches. Advert for swimming pool and Builders won't go away when you press CLOSE. Please, please fix that.",
            "I think it's so enjoying game for me because going to next level we are getting much interest it's not so hard game but we have to point red on the middle of target🎯",
            "Red sight difficult to see on red backgrounds. Need better contrast on sight and reticle. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable app.",

Update 10/15: daily bonus fails - check in same time every day - never get to day 7 award any longer. On top of incessant ads to just play, this is going on my 'only if I'm desperate & totally bored' pile. A real shame it has deteriorated to this.",

            "MINUS ONE STAR!! Super KAK as the Ads take longer to play than to clear a lever and there is a damn add aver every lever. And some adds make your phone glitch so you have to exit the game and then restart again. Not worth it. And the higher the levels go the longer the adds get. STAY AWAY.. FAR FAR AWAY",

When onset is slow, symptoms are often vague including feeling tired, weakness, shortness of breath, or poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms including: confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes noticeably pale. Problems with growth and development may occur in children. There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Iron-deficiency anemia is usually caused by blood loss, insufficient dietary intake, or poor absorption of iron from food. Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding. A poor ability to absorb iron may occur as a result of Crohn's disease or a gastric bypass. In the developing world parasitic worms, malaria, and HIV/AIDS increase the risk. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by blood tests.",

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",

        "description": "Stomach ache and abdominal pain\r\nA stomach ache is a term often used to refer to cramps or a dull ache in the tummy (abdomen). It's usually short-lived and is often not serious.\r\n\r\nSevere abdominal pain is a greater cause for concern. If it starts suddenly and unexpectedly, it should be regarded as a medical emergency, especially if the pain is concentrated in a particular area.\r\nSudden severe abdominal pain\r\n\r\nSerious causes of sudden severe abdominal pain include:\r\n\r\nappendicitis – the swelling of the appendix (a finger-like pouch connected to the large intestine), which causes agonising pain in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen, and means your appendix will need to be removed\r\na bleeding or perforated stomach ulcer – a bleeding, open sore in the lining of your stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine)\r\nkidney stones – small stones may be passed out in your urine, but larger stones may block the kidney tubes, and you'll need to go to hospital to have them broken up\r\ndiverticulitis – inflammation of the small pouches in the bowel that sometimes requires treatment with antibiotics in hospital\r\nSudden and severe pain in your abdomen can also sometimes be caused by an infection of the stomach and bowel (gastroenteritis). It may also be caused by a pulled muscle in your abdomen or by an injury.\r\nPossible causes in adults include:\r\nIBS – a common condition that causes bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea or constipation, the pain is often relieved when you go to the toilet\r\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD) – long-term conditions that involve inflammation of the gut, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and endometriosis\r\na urinary tract infection (UTI) that keeps returning – in these cases, you'll usually also experience a burning sensation when you urinate\r\nconstipation \r\nperiod pain – painful muscle cramps in women that are linked to the menstrual cycle\r\nother stomach-related problems – such as a stomach ulcer, heartburn and acid reflux or gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining\r\nSeveral conditions can cause upper stomach pain. In many cases, one condition can lead to another.\r\nGas\r\nA cause of upper stomach pain may be gas.\r\nGas occurs naturally in the intestines and digestive tract. When this gas accumulates, it can cause feelings of pressure, bloating, or fullness.\r\n\r\nAn infection, virus, diarrhea, or constipation can cause gas pain to become very intense.\r\n\r\nGas may be the culprit if:\r\n\r\nThe pain comes in waves.\r\nThe pain causes the stomach to swell.\r\nIt feels like something is moving in the stomach.\r\nThere is burping or passing of gas.\r\nGas pain is not usually serious, and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines can help. A person can also try eating more slowly to avoid swallowing air and prevent the gas from getting worse. \r\n2. Indigestion\r\nIndigestion is a burning feeling in the upper stomach, and sometimes in the mouth or throat. The pain may also feel like it stems from the chest.\r\n\r\nThe medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. It usually appears when there is too much acid in the stomach, which can happen after eating highly acidic foods.\r\nLess commonly, indigestion can result from a stomach ulcer, acid reflux, or even stomach cancer. Frequent indigestion that is very painful or occurs with unexplained weight loss could be a sign of a more serious concern.\r\n\r\nOTC medicines are highly effective at managing temporary indigestion. Identifying the triggers, such as certain foods, can help a person make healthful lifestyle changes.\r\n\r\nPeople with frequent or severe indigestion may wish to speak to a doctor about managing their symptoms or diagnosing an underlying cause.\r\n\r\nIndigestion medication is available for purchase online.\r\n\r\n3. Gastritis\r\nGastritis causes the stomach lining to become swollen and painful.\r\n\r\nAcute gastritis occurs in the short term and comes on quickly, usually because of a bacterial infection, such as with Helicobacter pylori bacteria.",

        "description": "Keeping up with the latest genetic testing guidelines for hereditary cancer can be challenging. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app helps healthcare providers quickly evaluate a patient's personal and family history to determine whether a genetics referral and/or testing is warranted. For quick reference, the app is organized by cancer type. For instance, if your patient has colon cancer (or a family history), the colorectal guidelines indicate the age cutoffs and significant family history features that warrant a genetics evaluation. The guidelines are based on national and professional society criteria that are often referenced by genetics professionals and the health insurance industry. Did you know there are dozens of genes and hereditary cancer conditions to consider when assessing your patient? A family can have many different types of cancers, all linked to a single inherited cancer gene. For example, your patient may have a personal history of prostate cancer, and a family history of breast or pancreatic cancer (as seen in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome). The app is designed to guide your questions as you discuss your patient’s family history. You will be able to determine if your patient meets referral criteria for HBOC syndrome, or another cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is available. Referral guidelines by cancer site: breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, blood (hematology), brain, endometrial, endocrine system, ovarian, skin, stomach, kidney (renal system), lung, and sarcomas. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app also provides quick links to information about labs and genetic testing options, local genetic counseling services, and web-based telegenetic services. Our goal is to create tools that make it easier for you to help your patients take advantage of the latest advances in genetic testing.",

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",

            "*please do not use this app if you want to diagnose something, this app will not help. It is designed for physicians in aiding in an evidence based approach in diagnostics.*   What a fantastic app. Never has it been more simple to calculate the post test probability. Thank you so much for making this possible. Please do keep updating the database, even if a pay functionality is warranted.",
            "This app organizes raw sign and symptom data to develop a differential diagnosis list. In reverse, it shows the weighting values. It is limited by a small diagnosis list and common diagnoses for which most physicians would not need assistance. It is well written but will see its true proof of concept as more diagnoses are added, bringing decision weight confabulation (in the programming sense) to the algorithm. Well done first effort! Peer reviewed crowd-sourcing might accelerate development."

The fruits:\r\n\r\nRich in vitamins, fiber and minerals, fruits are excellent health allies. Peaches and apricots are full of antioxidants, while bananas and kiwis will give you the energy you need to avoid tiredness in winter.\r\n2. Foods rich in fiber:\r\n\r\nIndispensable to the balance of the body, dietary fiber has many benefits. They help lower LDL cholesterol (which must remain low). The fibers regulate the intestinal transit as well as the absorption of carbohydrates and lipids, clean the body and act on the arterial hypertension. They are found in nuts, whole wheat, fruits and vegetables, or oats.\r\n\r\nConsume about 30 grams of fiber a day. Discover our 7 tips to consume more fiber per day.\r\n3. Fatty fish:\r\n\r\nA delicious commodity full of benefits. Fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel) are inexpensive sources of protein, vitamins and omega 3 that contribute to the proper functioning of the heart. Enjoy the beautiful days to eat in the form of barbecue, aperitif or grill. Fatty fish also help regulate LDL cholesterol.\r\n\r\nANSES recommends eating fresh fish twice a week.\r\n4. Legumes:\r\n\r\nRich in vegetable protein, fiber and vitamins (and low in fat), \"pulses\" are an integral part of a healthy diet and contribute to the effect of satiety. Legumes are many and varied: beans, lentils, soy, whole or broken peas, chickpeas, beans, alfalfa or lupins, you'll be spoiled for choice!\r\n5. The dried fruits:\r\n\r\nExcellent allies health to stay healthy in everyday life. There are two types of dried fruits: naturally dried fruits (almonds, nuts) and dehydrated fruits (apricots, dates).\r\n\r\nEach dry fruit has specific benefits: dates prevent tiredness, while nuts help reduce LDL cholesterol.\r\n6. White meat:\r\n\r\nLess fat than other types of meat, white meat (poultry, veal, pork, rabbit) is low in calories and high in protein. It is also economical meat and easy to cook with the menus of the week. According to some studies, white meat could also reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers (colon).\r\n7. Vegetable oil:\r\n\r\nWhether on toast or for frying food, many of us use butter in the kitchen everyday. Yet this food is rich in saturated fatty acids. Use instead vegetable oils (rapeseed, olive) that contain essential fatty acids, essential to our balanced diet and the proper functioning of the brain.\r\nAll you want to know about Healthy Eating is here\r\nsupport us in us note 5 *****",

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "Used this for years. After update, I can no longer zoom in to make text bigger and have the whole page rescale. That's WHY I was using it in the first place. VERY DISAPPOINTED and I'm not the only one complaining about this. What a stupid feature to remove! So I'll switch to something else so I can save my poor eyes! EDIT: The browser now supports the whole scale zoom and I'm very happy to begin using it again. THANK YOU development team!",
            "I actually like the app, it's the only browser I've ever used but few days ago I updated it and it's terrible. I can't go to any site, it loads up the addresses and just go blank (turns the screen black) and I can't see a thing. I've tried to reinstall it twice but instead it's still the same, please fix this ASAP....",
            "I update the latest version and it got worse than previous version. No thumnail picture and video. It happen when I open google site also for picture and video thumnail. The first is ok then when you scroll it down no picture came out. Good news is when i open or play the video randomly, its super fast loading. Bad news is i have to see the video one by one. Please fix this. My browse depends on you.",
            "I actually like this app, but the last two updates has made it difficult to handle, double clicking on 0pictures doesn't open them up anymore and the option of having a transparent background so I can use a darker theme that has less effect on my eyes, scrolling has also become slower. I hope measures can be taken to fix these problems",
            "I have used this app for more than 3 years, however lately this app is a big disappointment. The app breaks abruptly every time, if I fail to restore in time I lose all that was in the browser. Also lately it doesn't show the current sites on the browser list insted it just shows a list of uc browser tabs. Above all it's no longer a stable app. Too bad I have to source for another app."

The good; the ball action is quite good for the most part although speed control doesn't seem to be an option. Getting the ball to hook is a challenge as once released there is no control like other apps. It's very different from most apps in that everything is available from the start. The alleys and choice of balls ready to play. The music is different for all the alleys and mostly very nice listening.",
            "Reducing my rating front a 6 start to 2. Ads, the address have become nasty, obtrusive, annoying. I play this game far less nose than in the past because all the ads play sound and I found this out the first time in an environment where my phone should have been very quiet. What changed, greed in sure. This same shirt of thing is happening with all kinds of apps and it's really causing me to rethink what things I need and those I don't.",
            "Notice to all gamers if you want to play the games you have installed on your devices without having to be bothered by ads turn off your mobile data before you start the game and the game will play fine and the ads will not get through, no more ads ever. Its enough to have to pay for the use of the device we should not have to pay for the ads also, enough is ENOUGH!!!!!!",
            "Such a bad game because there's too many ads, when you aim left or right it goes the oppisite direction and the graphics are so bad in this game such a silly bowling game, other bowling games are way better than this one, Im uninstalling this game because it sucks👎👎👎",
            "Great game it's fun and time consuming but it would be better if you can add more colors to play with and more design and there is A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF ADS so it's awsome also you should add a computer mode with different difficultys it's a fun game I recommend it for everyone"

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",

I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "I absolutely love this app! Moving away from the big tech companies is doing this human really good!! I don't like to be influenced in my advertising or my feeds. Nobody gets to manipulate me! every time I search I get exactly what I'm looking for and even more articles than Google would have ever provided! The best part is it's private! Nobody's sharing my information! Tell your friends take control of your life!!",
            "I've been using this for quite awhile now & have made it my default browser. I love the privacy aspect- especially now that we're in the middle of the election. I don't get the SPAM emails that I do if I use the typical Android browsers. DDG has all of the functionality that other browsers do but the best one is being able to delete my browsing data without a trace, & it auto blocks cookies( which media & shopping sites don't like, but I think it's great.) It's also very user friendly.",
            "I've been using this browser for 1 1/2 years with no problems until 2 weeks ago. When I tried to login to a site I use regularly I got a message saying it doesn't support Safari 4 and I keep getting this message since then. I could use chrome, but I don't want to. I sent 2 emails to the developers last week. They haven't replied. Disappointing! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Didn't solve the problem. If I had gotten a reply from technical support I would have rated it a 5.",
            "All it really needs is a built in ad blocker and it would be the best private browser you'll ever really find. Its speed makes it an amazing \"default\" browser for quick use, and the ability for it to automatically erase your data after a period of inactivity is priceless! But until it can block ads, I still have to primarily use other browsers for YouTube and leisure browsing. Without that important function (which is a basic standard today), it still falls under a very niche browser.",
            "Wowser Browser! DDG allows me options that none of the others do. For example, it allows copy & paste a host of things with ease much like Chrome without the peeking over your shoulder cookie monsters. It isn't such a hassle to save your favorite/ most visited sites. Sounds simple enough. But to my frustration with the exception of a few browsers, you have to literally manually save a site that you just want the browser to open up to automatically. I love DDG!"

            "I like this game so much but after the Halloween update, it looks like it needs more data and I can't play a smooth game🙁 Sometimes when I earn so much coins, suddenly it will show like 'Talking Tom Hero Dash isn't responding'. And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

        "description": "Problems with the spine such as osteoporosis can lead to back pain.\r\nThe human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.\r\n\r\nThe segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.\r\n\r\nProblems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.\r\n\r\nDamage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others.\r\n\r\nStrain\r\nBack pain commonly stems from strain, tension, or injury. Frequent causes of back pain are:\r\n\r\nstrained muscles or ligaments\r\na muscle spasm\r\nmuscle tension\r\ndamaged disks\r\ninjuries, fractures, or falls\r\nActivities that can lead to strains or spasms include:\r\n\r\nlifting something improperly\r\nlifting something that is too heavy\r\nmaking an abrupt and awkward movement\r\nStructural problems\r\nA number of structural problems may also result in back pain.\r\n\r\nRuptured disks: Each vertebra in the spine is cushioned by disks. If the disk ruptures there will be more pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nBulging disks: In much the same way as ruptured disks, a bulging disk can result in more pressure on a nerve.\r\nSciatica: A sharp and shooting pain travels through the buttock and down the back of the leg, caused by a bulging or herniated disk pressing on a nerve.\r\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis can cause problems with the joints in the hips, lower back, and other places. In some cases, the space around the spinal cord narrows. This is known as spinal stenosis.\r\nAbnormal curvature of the spine: If the spine curves in an unusual way, back pain can result. An example is scoliosis, in which the spine curves to the side.\r\nOsteoporosis: Bones, including the vertebrae of the spine, become brittle and porous, making compression fractures more likely.\r\nKidney problems: Kidney stones or kidney infection can cause back pain.\r\nMovement and posture\r\nBack pain can also result from some everyday activities or poor posture.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n\r\ntwisting\r\ncoughing or sneezing\r\nmuscle tension\r\nover-stretching\r\nbending awkwardly or for long periods\r\npushing, pulling, lifting, or carrying something\r\nstanding or sitting for long periods\r\nstraining the neck forward, such as when driving or using a computer\r\nlong driving sessions without a break, even when not hunched\r\nsleeping on a mattress that does not support the body and keep the spine straight\r\nOther causes\r\nSome medical conditions can lead to back pain.\r\n\r\nCauda equina syndrome: The cauda equine is a bundle of spinal nerve roots that arise from the lower end of the spinal cord. Symptoms include a dull pain in the lower back and upper buttocks, as well as numbness in the buttocks, genitalia, and thighs. There are sometimes bowel and bladder function disturbances.\r\nCancer of the spine: A tumor on the spine may press against a nerve, resulting in back pain.\r\nInfection of the spine: A fever and a tender, warm area on the back could be due to an infection of the spine.\r\nOther infections: Pelvic inflammatory disease, bladder, or kidney infections may also lead to back pain.\r\nSleep disorders: Individuals with sleep disorders are more likely to experience back pain, compared with others.\r\nShingles: An infection that can affect the nerves may lead to back pain. This depends on which nerves are affected.",

        "description": "The pancreas is about 6 inches long and sits across the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen and is connected to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) through a small tube called the pancreatic duct. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body.\r\n\r\n            Pancreas Conditions\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 1: The body’s immune system attacks and destroys the pancreas’ insulin-producing cells. Lifelong insulin injections are required to control blood sugar.\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 2: The pancreas loses the ability to appropriately produce and release insulin. The body also becomes resistant to insulin, and blood sugar rises.\r\n\r\nCystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems, usually including the lungs and the pancreas. Digestive problems and diabetes often result.\r\nPancreatic cancer: The pancreas has many different types of cells, each of which can give rise to a different type of tumor. The most common type arises from the cells that line the pancreatic duct. Because there are usually few or no early symptoms, pancreatic cancer is often advanced by the time it’s discovered.\r\n\r\nPancreatitis: The pancreas becomes inflamed and damaged by its own digestive chemicals. Swelling and death of tissue of the pancreas can result. Although alcohol or gallstones can contribute, sometimes a cause for pancreatitis is never found.\r\nPancreatic pseudocyst: After a bout of pancreatitis, a fluid-filled cavity called a pseudocyst can form. Pseudocysts may resolve spontaneously, or they may need surgical drainage.\r\nIslet cell tumor: The hormone-producing cells of the pancreas multiply abnormally, creating a benign or cancerous tumor.  These tumors produce excess amounts of hormones and then release them into the blood. Gastrinomas, glucagonomas, and insulinomas are examples of islet cell tumors.\r\n\r\nEnlarged pancreas: An enlarged pancreas may mean nothing. You may simply have a pancreas that is larger than normal. Or, it can be because of an anatomic abnormality. But other causes of an enlarged pancreas may exist and require treatment.\r\n    \r\n          Pancreas Tests\r\n\r\nPhysical examination: By pressing on the center of the belly, a doctor might check for a mass in the pancreas. He or she can also look for other signs of pancreas conditions.\r\nComputed tomography scan: A CT scanner takes multiple X-rays, and a computer creates detailed images of the pancreas and abdomen. Contrast dye may be injected into your veins to improve the images.\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Magnetic waves create highly detailed images of the abdomen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an MRI that focuses on the pancreas, liver, and bile system.\r\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): Using a camera on a flexible tube advanced from the mouth to the intestine, a doctor can access the area of the pancreas head. Tiny surgical tools can be used to diagnose and treat some pancreas conditions.\r\nPancreas biopsy: Either using a needle through the skin or a surgical procedure, a small piece of pancreas tissue is removed to look for cancer or other conditions.\r\nUltrasound: A probe is placed on the belly, and harmless sound waves create images by reflecting off the pancreas and other organs.\r\nAmylase and lipase: Blood tests showing elevated levels of these pancreatic enzymes can suggest pancreatitis.\r\nSweat chloride test: A painless electric current stimulates the skin to sweat, and the chloride in perspiration is measured. People with cystic fibrosis often have high sweat chloride levels.\r\nGenetic testing: Many different mutations of a single gene can cause cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing can help identify if an adult is an unaffected carrier or if a child will develop cystic fibrosis.\r\n   \r\n       Pancreas Treatments;\r\nInsulin  Injection\r\nPseudocyst drainage\r\nPseudocyst surgery\r\npancreatic cancer\r\nPancreatic enzymes\r\nPancreas transplantation",

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "This app is wonderful!, i play this game after online class and this is a huge relief that i found these games. However there are a couple of fatal flaws, firstly. Ads, ads and ads EVERYWHERE. This is a pet peeve, and i need to turn off my internet just to have peaceful gameplay. Secondly, the bots. Its suprisingly EASY to get past all the stages. Maybe add game modes? Like battle royale mode, a hard mode. Make it challenging once in a while. I don't find this app good or bad, its pretty decent.",

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

        "title": "Hemorrhoids Treatment - How To Get Rid Of Piles",
        "description": "Hemorrhoids (HEM-uh-roids), also called piles, are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins. Hemorrhoids have a number of causes, although often the cause is unknown. They may result from straining during bowel movements or from the increased pressure on these veins during pregnancy. Hemorrhoids may be located inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids), or they may develop under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).\r\n\r\nHemorrhoids are very common. Nearly 75% of adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time. Sometimes they don't cause symptoms but at other times they cause itching, discomfort and bleeding.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a clot may form in a hemorrhoid (thrombosed hemorrhoid). These are not dangerous but can be extremely painful and sometimes need to be lanced and drained.\r\n\r\nHemorrhoid treatments are often searched for on the internet because they are such a common problem, and you, the hemorrhoid sufferer, want to find the quickest and easiest solution to your problem. Finding the right hemorrhoid treatment may be your best hope to eliminating your hemorrhoids before resorting to surgery. You probably have tried ignoring your hemorrhoids at the beginning, but have gotten to the point, where that is no longer possible. Turning to the internet to find hemorrhoid treatments, you know that there are many websites offering their products out in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nIt can be confusing to read the various ads which usually contain only sales pitches, and little factual information about hemorrhoid treatments. Our company, Natural Herbway, emphasizes that we have your well-being as our first priority, and we want you to be as informed as possible about all the types of home remedies and medical treatments available. We believe that the more informed you are, the better will be your choice in selecting an appropriate hemorrhoid treatment for yourself.\r\n\r\nWe can not stress enough that before you attempt to find a hemorrhoid treatment for yourself, you should see your doctor for a diagnosis. You need to be sure that you have hemorrhoids. There are other diseases that should be ruled out, such as anal cancer, fissures, pruritus ani, and other conditions. At the doctor's office, you will likely receive a digital rectal examine, and if necessary an instrument will be used to view the interior of the rectum. Further testing may be advised to rule out other gastrointestinal diseases which can cause bleeding. Once you have that diagnosis, you can begin to consider what hemorrhoid treatment will be right for you, and you will be on the path to eliminating hemorrhoids from your life.\r\n\r\nHome Remedies are anything that you can find or do in your own house which will lessen your symptoms. If your hemorrhoids are caught early enough, you can make simple lifestyle changes to clear them up, and you can avoid hemorrhoid treatments altogether.\r\n\r\nBy Downloading and using this FREE STOP SNORING App you will learn;\r\n\r\nHow to Gain Weight Fast in a Safe Way\r\nHow to Gain Weight Fast: What Foods to Eat and Avoid\r\nHow to Gain Weight Fast If You Have No Muscles\r\nHow To Gain Weight Fast - For Skinny Men\r\nHow to Gain Weight Fast - Healthy Weight Gain for Women\r\n\r\nAND\r\nMuch much more..........\r\n\r\nFinding Relief With Hemorrhoid Treatments\r\nHemorrhoid Cure - Natural Hemorrhoid Treatment That Works Fast\r\nLifestyle and home remedies\r\n10 Tips For Natural Hemorrhoids Treatment at Home\r\nHemorrhoid Pain & How to Relieve It\r\n\r\nThis app will show you how to cure Hemorrhoid and it's free.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThe info contained in the app is not a substitute for professional medical or health advice, examination, diagnosis, or treatment.

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Great game. Superb quality and excellent graphics. The only thing is when you run out of balls and you are sent back to the home screen you cannot continue without the premium bonus. There should at least be 1 more free gamemode or it will get boring. If it gets boring you loose players. If you loose players it will run downhill quickly. Please improve this. If it gets improved I will rate 5. For now its 4",
            "I love this game! It's really good,time eating and fun! The graphics is just out of this world! I just don't like 2 things: 1.the fact that you have to restart the game every time from the beginning (if you don't want to buy premium) 2.when you miss only ONE crystal you lose all multiballs!(and the steps). That 2 facts are the reason I gave this game 4 stars. I would recommend this though!",
            "It's really fun and helps me focus, the music in the background and the sounds of breaking glass is also very relaxing, but one thing i noticed is when they tell you \"checkpoint saved\", sometimes it doesnt let you click on the screen or doesn't detect your fingers on the screen, if you could fix that, that would be great!👌💖",
            "It's a really nice game . N I really liked it just the thing is that u have to take a look at ur balls otherwise it does not take time to be finished 😂 Leaving this the game is perfect. If u r bored u can absolutely play it. It's the best way to time pass. If u r out u will definitely play the other But u will never b full of this game.😁 Play and enjoy the game.",
            "I love this game! The only thing i have a problem with is there's not enough levels. I passed every level, then it goes to endless mode i think it's called. Other than that it's an awesome game, very well made. Side note: i did purchase the premium version, because of how much i love this game!"

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "Almost impossible to complete monopoly game. Need 1 Free Spin. 500 spins later still no free spin. The Game knows the challenges you have to complete. And just like that the machines get tight. I know it's Gambling. But hell I've played Real Slots looser than this game when challenges need to be met.",
            "This is by far my favorite slots game. I like the weekly competitions and side games. I enjoy the interactive slot games, all the oompa loompa slots on all levels. With they had it where you could use real cash. They would be F****** awesome...",
            "Very expensive to play. Trying to hit daily and weekly goals has cost thousands. More expensive to play than a real casino slot machine. Promotional game wiped out points with nearly 600 near-consecutive losses. The Zynga algos are geared for max losses.",
            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

Preventive services can help keep you healthy by finding health problems early and can keep you from getting certain diseases.\r\n\r\nWhat’s covered will help you answer questions like:\r\n\r\n- Will my Medicare benefits cover services to help me stop smoking?\r\n\r\n- Can I get a cervical cancer screening?\r\n\r\n- How often will my Medicare coverage allow me to get a bone mass measurement?\r\n\r\nAsk your doctor or health care provider which preventive services (like screenings, shots, and tests) you need to get.\r\n\r\nPart A & Part B Costs\r\n\r\nMedicare Part A and Part B cover certain medical services and supplies in hospitals, doctors’ offices, and other health care settings.\r\n\r\nPart A hospital insurance coverage helps pay for inpatient care in a hospital, inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, home health care, or inpatient care in a religious nonmedical health care institution. Copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles may apply for each service.\r\n\r\nPart B medical insurance coverage supports medically necessary doctors’ services, outpatient care, home health services, durable medical equipment, preventive services, and other medical services. Under Original Medicare, if the Part B deductible applies, you must pay all health care costs (up to the Medicare-approved amount) until you meet the yearly Part B deductible. After your deductible is met, Medicare begins to pay its share and you typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount of the service, if the doctor or health care provider accepts assignment. There’s no yearly limit for what you pay out-of-pocket.\r\n\r\nFor some items and services, you must meet eligibility criteria or you may be responsible for paying all costs. Your doctor or health care provider may recommend you get services more often than Medicare covers. Or, they may recommend services that Medicare doesn’t cover. If this happens, you may have to pay some or all of the costs. Ask questions so you understand why your doctor is recommending certain services and whether Medicare will pay for them.\r\n\r\nUse the What’s covered app to answer questions like:\r\n\r\n-How much will I pay for prescription drugs included in Medicare Part B coverage?\r\n\r\n-Does the Part B deductible apply for cardiac rehab?\r\n\r\n-What percentage of the Medicare-approved amount will I need to pay for colorectal cancer screenings?\r\n\r\nWhat’s Not Included\r\n\r\nWhat’s covered doesn’t contain information on Medicare Advantage Plan, other Medicare health plan, or Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) coverage. It doesn’t contain a CPT code search, exact costs on surgeries or procedures, or local coverage decisions.\r\n\r\nMedicare Advantage Plans\r\n\r\nIf you have a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare health plan, you have the same basic health care coverage as people who have Original Medicare, but the rules vary by plan. Some Medicare Advantage Plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover - like vision, hearing, or dental. Check with the plan or search in the App or Google Play Store to see if the plan has a similar mobile application.\r\n\r\nThis is Medicare’s first official app, and we value your feedback.

I could only locate generic topics with no specific yes/no answer relating to me. To me, the answer to a question \"Is covered?\" is a yes or a no answer. This app did not provide it, only \"Topic not found. \" i am greatly disappointed...",
            "When you type in things like Hip Replacement, Knee Replacement, Shoulder Surgery or any other major issues it either comes back with appliances (passive motion machine or physical therapy etc) or nothing at all rather than if that particular issue is covered by Medicare. In other words, this app is woefully lacking in information about what is actually covered by Medicare or at least the percentage covered.",
            "I appreciate that Medicare is trying to make an app to help us know what is covered and how often. However, I am surprised to see that the app was released at a somewhat early stage of development. Compared with the information available on the web site, this app is lacking much information, thus making its usefulness very limited. I will check back every now and then. If the functionality becomes more like the functionality of searching on the web site, this app has very good potential."

            "This game is the best there ever was. It has a lot of cars and also cool graphics. the graphics are even better than some gta games. and the crashings are maaaaaddddd!!!. Because when a car crash you can finish the race with your crashed car. It has many tracks and you can travel to other cities. The game is goooood!!! I need to see the \"lynkan hypersport\" in this game that is my favourite car",
            "I am only 12 and I wasn't really that much of a 12 year old kid that really liked to play games until I downloaded it and it is so fun you get to customize your vehicle like the engine, tires, paint, and other things. And the derbys are so fun to play you can have up to 11 or 12 cars with you in the derby. And the best part is it is offline. One last thing could you add a 1970 dodge charger with the engine sticking out of the hood please.",
            "This is a awesome game! Really love this game. I gave this game 5 stars! Because the controls is alright, the gameplay is awesome and the graphics is very good... What I love is that, this is not just a demolition derby, you can do racing as well! That makes it more fun to play and addictive. Keeps me busy and I enjoy this game alot! Would give it 6 stars if I could ;-) I would love to see my favourite car 1969 Volkswagen Beetle!",
            "It's a good game and everyone should get it. I like the game it's a fun game to play I have made five or six cars completely upgraded and they are really cool cars and I rely won't to now what car is under the torp I bet it a good car 🚗. I always make my car red whith red wendos and white flams it's rely cool . They also have red and white tiyers.",
            "This game is really fun but the down side is that it gives u a little bit of ads when u finish the racing on but over all it is really fun. Their is so many cars that u can buy and wheels so many things that u need to check out but I really wish their was a monster truck in the game it would be so much better."

I downloaded it for the system tools, but it comes with an awesome wallpaper gallery where you can download them for free. It would be one of the best wallpaper apps on it's own (5⭐) so it's remarkable it's free. There are many high quality wallpapers & a lot of variety so I think there's something for everyone. Just checked out the File Manager app. 5⭐! These guys know how to design & develop software! Rockstars!",
            "I liked this app. I don't mind ads at all. I understand you game developers need a paycheck. But, they were making the app very hard to use. So, I and I image many others wrote feedback, and it is now fixed. Thank you for caring about us & fixinf the issue.",
            "Was wonderful for a while and then ads covering the screen. Scare tactics ads and others. I have never seen so many ads on an app. Makes it hard to use now.",

That goes for Motels, rental cars, and even apps... as is the case in this example. Also, it offered a rare chance for me to speak eloquently and feel important. Ha ha! After all, it's a great value for FREE.",
            "Very, VERY HELPFUL APP!!! Does exactly what it should. No gimmicks, just straight to the point, VERY easy to use by anyone. I highly recommend this app as a MUST HAVE for any smart phone. Even if your phone is already working well, this app will improve on that with only a couple of taps!! 10 out of 10! 5 out of 5! %100 recommended!!! Perfect app!! Its truly a must have!!!! Try it! You have nothing to lose with this amazing app!!!"

The joystick, when I always walk on the bridge (The one with wool that players can buy from game) it always go to the right side of my joystick!!! So I fall down when the joystick let me go to the right. Please fix this bug!!!!",

It would be better if it had the creatures or ender pearls(preferably both). And make to where it's one of those games where its you die in the first 3 Minutes of the game. If you fix some or all of these issues I will raise my rating. Other than that I enjoy this game very much so. It is worth downloading.",
            "Sometimes I wonder why this game is still up. I can't even count how many people I see hacking, breaking the game, and more clown moves. And the game producers have done nothing to fix it. So it is really annoying playing the game. But I can't stop beneath all the stuff I listed it is a really adictive game which is why I didnt give one star. But if these things dont get fixed I would rather play something else.",
            "I love this game!!!! it's soo fun..in the real Minecraft bedwars the swords,fireball and more cost ALOT of iron ,gold , diamonds and emeralds and it's harder to PvP so this game is better!!! please make more game's I love this too much!! I hope everyone is doing well and happy in carona virus (covid 19). 🙂🙂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🤍",
            "I only tell honest reviews. This is mine for this game: This game is probably one of the best games for android outside of Minecraft for blocky graphics. It has a very Minecrafty feel to it and I really enjoy playing this. Congrats to the developers. It has every basic weapon that ordinary BedWars has and then some. I also enjoy that everything works like it does is real deal Minecraft. Definitely a good pick."

            "This is a classic \"caring for your pet\" game. Has more mini games than talking tom/talking angela/ the one with the purple thing that theyve made like 7 editions to/ also more custom options than all the other ones too. Its very kid friendly (im 19 i can justify even though i have no kids) the only way you can make friends is through email. Highly sugest",
            "i just love love this game but i don't lt really like how it makes me pay real mony to get the baby potion and the adult potion. But there is 4 bugs the first one is Whenever i get of the game and get back on it gliches and it makes it hard to play. The other bug is that when i get a new pillow it looks wierd.The next bug is some games i play aren't working. The last bug is on beach volly my pet is cheating! And that really makes me mad! So please fix those bugs and it is hard to level up!",
            "i like pou but i have 5 bugs the first bug is that i dont like that you have to pay 99$ to have the baby potion. the next bug is that when you have to play the same games over and over again. the 3rd bug is that when you buy a pillow it looks wired. the forth bug is that when you go play volly ball on pvp it won,t let you do it. the last bug is when i get on pou it turns in to a recktangoll and it makes my costume werid so pleas fix the those bugs.",

            "I haven't been playing this game for 3 years. But this game is normall ehe theres like no ads, um.. Theres a creepy thing about this game.

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points.

No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",

Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5⭐",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including • More materials • More space • And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

            "The Game is frequently updated to force players to spend money - alot of money - if they want to be competitive! Otherwise progress is painfully slow. With frequent updates glitches are generated which destroys enjoyment of the game. Slow the update rate down, and give the smaller castles (with little spare cash) time to catch up with the 'big boys'. If not more players will leave in droves and the kingdoms will become more stagnant than they currently are! You must prove the game environment!",
            "The game can be fun, but do not play unless you want to spend money. It requires a lot to be able to play with any kind of semblance of a chance. There are people who spend so much money that you can never ever ever ever keep up and that means you will always be dead in the water no matter what. Edit: Typical response by developer which does not address the issue which is that they encourage this behavior with the way they do updates and game play is implemented. Docked one more star.",
            "Not really a fair game for new players. Peace shields are limited and don't last long enough. Kill events literally end your passion for this game. They need to enable a join feature not an FFA. I cannot beat a kingdom of 30 when I just joined 1 week ago and am at 10. As soon as I pop shield, homophobic and racial slurs blasts the announcements. TL;DR new players gets CC'd and if you don't let others attack you, you get abused with controversial slurs. More work needed.",
            "It is absolutely awful that I've been forced to tap and follow some stupid hard to follow \"tutorial\" that isn't teaching me ANYTHING because of its poor design literally dozens of times FORCED TO TAP WHAT YOU WANT and STILL can't turn that God awful \"music\" off or the sound for that matter. This is extremely horrible and the \"story\" isn't even going at a pace or way I feel remotely like I care to be forced to tap through either. It's terrible. Really terrible.",
            "Been playing since the beginning and this game is a dumpster fire now. Constant updates that make it more more expensive and introduce more bugs than fixes. Also they like to reset major aspects of the game so they can charge you for features that you already had. And if you contact customer service they will tell you whatever is broken is supposed to be like that. Don't waste your money"

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

The body also eliminates toxins through the kidneys, intestines, lungs, lymphatic system, and skin. However, when these systems are compromised, impurities aren't properly filtered and the body is adversely affected.\r\n\r\nA detox program can help the body's natural cleansing process by:\r\n\r\nResting the organs through fasting;\r\nStimulating the liver to drive toxins from the body;\r\nPromoting elimination through the intestines, kidneys, and skin;\r\nImproving circulation of the blood; and\r\nRefueling the body with healthy nutrients.\r\n\r\nBennett suggests that everyone should detox at least once a year. However, Bennett cautions against detoxing for nursing mothers, children, and patients with chronic degenerative diseases, cancer or tuberculosis. Consult your healthcare practitioner if you have questions about whether detoxing is right for you.\r\n\r\nFirst, lighten up your toxin load. Eliminate alcohol, coffee, cigarettes, refined sugars, and saturated fats, all of which act as toxins in the body and are obstacles to your healing process. Also, minimize use of chemical-based household cleaners and personal health care products (cleansers, shampoos, deodorants, and toothpastes), and substitute natural alternatives.\r\n\r\nAnother hindrance to good health is stress, which triggers your body to release stress hormones into your system. While these hormones can provide the \"\"adrenaline rush\"\" to win a race or meet a deadline, in large amounts they create toxins and slow down detoxification enzymes in the liver.

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

(Obviously) But unlike most other games like these, the ads barely even bother you! The only trouble I'm having is sometimes when I collect keys or coins it lags just a bit, not enough to mess up the entire \"round\" though. Also anytime I'm trying to buy something (With in-game coins) It will switch to another thing like toppings or food items and buy those instead.PlzFix",
            "Game is fun but the levels actually only repeat it's self, i got all the foods with in 2 days, i got the unicorn in 1 day and the space cat in the 2nd day, i reccomend this game if u like saticefying games, add a longer and better level every now and then it would be great,i gave 3 stars because of the repeating levels and the quick ones to and because it is not very creative 👍🏻🙃",
            "I just downloaded this game and I already like it!Its very fun and reminds me of when me and my mum were baking together!It is hard to keep the cream on the foods,yes but besides from that I recommend downloading it! Also something pretty Annoying can happen where there is too many adds but the game 'yes that dress'(wich I'll recommend downloading to)has adds every next button so the game 'yes that dress'has more adds",
            "To say it's kinda boring but normally it's a very good game it's so much fun and it has a bit of slow motion when I ice the cream on top of the strawberries and waffles and just installed this game today!I'm 8 years old but this is 3 stars it's kinda boring",
            "I saw this in an ad ao i decided to try it. The idea itself sounlds not to bad, but it turned out to be a bit laggy and had this vibration everytime i squeezed the cream? I think the vibration is the point but i think the vibration feeling is annoying and bothering"

            "Hey guy's I'm on season 89 an I've a massive time out lost so much that i spent four hours playing the event this morning an when I went to log back in it went back to the start. So can someone please have a look at what is going on an try to fix it. I don't pay for anything I just send the time watching the ads an I've been playing trailer park boys for almost 3 years now so if you could have a look at what is going on it would be much appreciated cheers 🤘✌😎",
            "I quite enjoy the game, been playing for ages now! I love the frequent themed events put on each week. The story lines throughout are funny and the ads that people moan about aren't that imposing! I don't even know how long it's been since I started this game but I'm definitely carrying on for a long time! It's the one and only game that's lasted so long on my phone!",
            "Used to be awesome, now it's all ads, and half the ads are broken. I have played this game for years, and ever since they introduced the watch ads to double income after idle, I can't catch up with the events. I've honestly never considered deleting this until now but when half of the ads don't pay out the reward, I can't even place now, and I have tried even paying actual money, ugh. And why do I have to watch these ads now just to place in events when I used to be able to just fine? Meh",
            "The game gives the illusion of strategy. It takes advantage of TPB fans, and the only reason I played as long as I did was because I thought the devs actually cared about the players experience, but that has turned out too definitely not be the case. I had to learn that just because they respond doesn't mean they care at all if you're being ripped off.",
            "The game is fun and can be addictive if you enjoy idle games. There are some technical problems that I've run into though. Often it doesn't register daily login rewards or if you exit an event and come back to it later it won't register changes you made prior to leaving the event. I've had the game set me back hours before and that's pretty crappy when you are competing for prizes on a leaderboard."
