        "description": "A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or canceroustumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondarytumors that have spread from elsewhere, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. \r\nThe cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, Epstein–Barr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Brain tumor symptoms, Brain tumor Treatment, Brain tumor causes, Brain tumor diagnosis, Brain tumor Prognosis, Brain tumor Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Brain tumor Disease apps -",

            "Well, there are hundreds of advertisements which are displayed after 2 seconds! They are quite annoying. So, I didn't give 1 star. And also, in the levels, there is a option \" Enter \" which isn't working. Everytime I tap, it displays ❎. I request the producers to improve these problems. But it must be mentioned that this is an excellent game. There are tricky puzzles to play and pinch your brain and there are thousands of brain teasers. I do recommend this app to all customers. Thank you.",

You don't always have to click the Light Bulb icon. The questions will get harder, and harder. Btw I love this app <3 Keep up the good work!!",

No. Just no."

            "Decent app, but not terribly detailed 3D content, and a blast of video ads right off the bat. It'd be sweet to have a chance to try before buying via ad. I spent more time of my first five minutes on ads than I did the app, which made it not worth my time. It may be fine otherwise, but there are online offerings that are simply more timee-effective for me.",
            "It's very sensitive, so its hard to control the angle of which you look at it. There are just too many ads as well. Maybe it was just me, but the ad on the bottom, covered the name of the part. So, it was basically useless having the app when I couldn't read the names of the parts. I'm pretty sure that the app is at fault for this, not my phone, but some of the choices didn't work that the menu had to offer. If I were you, just stick to pencil and paper.",

            "Ok game. Way to many ads. Not sure how they get paid. BUT it seems if they get enough ads watched, before the game is uninstalled, they are happy. Because they must know its way to many and just dont care. This game is just to make a quick dollar.",
            "Game really REALLY wants you to watch those ads. Some puzzles are easy to solve but won't work properly unless you get a hint first, which I let slide the first few times because I thought maybe I just wasn't doing the puzzles right, but it very quickly started to get annoying. Fun puzzles, for the most part, but more often than not are they more like questions you'd get on a school exam than fun little word problems to solve.",
            "Got to the first one I needed a hint for, and used 25 points for a clue. All it tells me is that it's an easy one. Really? Upsides: There weren't many ads. Downsides: Other than the main issue, the tricks aren't consistent in their logic when compared to a previous similar challenge, like something having to do with size may have similar wording using different logic.",
            "I tried playing the game but it was not as great and i had trouble opening the refrigerator on the second level I hope you can fix that please. But it was a great game needs some fixing but I recommend it if you are tired of games that don't make sense . But great game. But needs alot more levels I know some six year olds that have no trouble playing this and it is not that complicated . But no hate",
            "I feel like this game was okay. Overall there were a bunch of ads but the game was pretty easy. I only skipped a few and even the 4 year old kid I was babysitting could complete some levels. It only took like 2 weeks to finish the whole game but I'm giving it 3 stars because they need to add more levels and less ads!!!"

No specific info at all on the visual system (or other modalities), for example the optic nerve, which is a massive oversight. Where's LGN? superior colliculus? hell, where's v1?? as a phd student, thats the level of information that would be helpful for me - a lot of this is undergrad level knowledge (which is fine but there are alotta grads out there who could really benefit from more specific, less superficial info)",

            "I love this app. I have a degree in neuroscience, but because I don't really use it in my work, I like to open this every once in a while to remind myself of some neuroanatomy so I don't lose my knowledge."

            "Looks super useful but can't input temozolomide's 5days on 23days off cycle. Probably better support for other cancers, but that's a deal breaker for brain cancer. Also, probably should differentiate between cancer symptoms and medication side effects. There is no way to input side effects in the past. When I am feeling sick, the last thing I want to do is mess with the phone. For heavy reactions, input is going to be retroactive, so good to support that I think."

            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",

            "Nice but too many ads and not skippable. EDIT: ok now the ads are skippable and much better. Unfortunately I am at level 60 and still not much of a challenge. But quite cute for kids.",
            "The is okay. Its to pass the time. The play is easy or you might have to think a little. However, an ad after every and I MEAN EVERY damn level is ridiculous as hell. Get rid of that ish please...it drives me kinda crazy. Ok bye!!",
            "Literally over half of screen time is ads. Games are 3-4 seconds long, minimum 5 second ads, AFTER EVERY SINGLE GAME. Don't bother with this.",
            "I hate it I hope this game shuts down the creator of this game is the worst!!!!!!!!!!! Bad graphics easy challenges and it's not like what you see in the ads do not download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body.\r\n\r\nThe App provides a unique review of the essential topographical anatomy of the brain from an MRI perspective, correlating high-quality anatomaical plates with the corresponding high-resolution MRI images. The App includes a historical review of brain mapping and an analysis of the essential reference planes used for the study of the human brain. Subsequent chapters provide a detailed review of the sulcal and the gyral anatomy of the human cortex, guiding the reader through an interpretation of the individual brain atlas provided by high-resolution MRI. The relationship between brain structure and function is approached in a topograhical fashion with analysis of the necessary imaging methodology and displayed anatomy. The central, perisylvian, mesial temporal and occipital areas receive special attention. Imaging of the core brain structures is included.

When you're going through chemo/cancer treatment, and your solicited an app that's supposed to \"help,\" it's very discouraging when the app does nothing it's supposed to do.",

And there's more. I would recommend waiting to see if they respond before installing.",

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",
            "I will say it is good app for those who really want to become cardiologist. I am intrested in these types of activities. I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",
            "The first sentence in the dialog has a typo. Decided to overlook it. It seems the dialog is very poor and controls aren't any better.",
            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

Apabila organ otak ini sudah tidak sehat, maka organ yang lain pun akan ikut terganggu, sehingga pada akhirnya banyak orang yang mengalami kematian akibat penyakit ini.\r\n\r\nTumor otak ini juga dapat menjangkiti kita kapan saja dan dimana saja, namun kalau masalah umur biasanya penyakit kanker otak ini akan menjangkiti seseorang yang sudah dewasa.

Actually I thought of dwonloading other game but your game has make me intelligent 😋 and it's interesting while I'm doing nothing but your game has a feeling that makes me happy because I answer and the game asked haha Btw the best is the multiplication stage ahh it's sad that now people doesn't have time to play like your game but other shooting games like PUBG but still this is the best game ever. And BTW Name's SIZZLE 13 years old 😁 ❤❤❤❤❤",
            "If I said thanks then this is not enough and it will never be enough. By all means, this app is remarkable and so useful. Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

        "description": "A gallstone is a stone formed within the gallbladder out of bile components. The term cholelithiasis may refer to the presence of gallstones or to the diseases caused by gallstones. Most people with gallstones (about 80%) never have symptoms. When a gallstone blocks the bile duct, a crampy pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, known as biliary colic (gallbladder attack) can result. This happens in 1–4% of those with gallstones each year. Complications of gallstones may include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), jaundice, and infection of a bile duct (cholangitis). Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, dark urine, and pale stools. \r\nRisk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Gallstones formed mainly from cholesterol are termed cholesterol stones, and those mainly from bilirubin are termed pigment stones. Gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms. Diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound.

The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is between two and six weeks. When symptoms occur, they typically last eight weeks and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain.

Acute liver failure may rarely occur, with this being more common in the elderly. \r\nIt is usually spread by eating food or drinking water contaminated with infected feces.[1] Shellfish which have not been sufficiently cooked are a relatively common source. It may also be spread through close contact with an infectious person. While children often do not have symptoms when infected, they are still able to infect others. After a single infection, a person is immune for the rest of his or her life. Diagnosis requires blood testing, as the symptoms are similar to those of a number of other diseases.

It is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years. \r\nThe cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% of the risk is believed to be genetic with many genesusually involved. Other risk factors include a history of head injuries, depression, or hypertension. The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis. Mental and physical exercise, and avoiding obesitymay decrease the risk of AD; however, evidence to support these recommendations is not strong.

        "description": "Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.\r\nThe virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The hepatitis B viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five main hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis B Guide, Hepatitis B Disease Management & Hepatitis B Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis B Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team 🙏🏻🥰"

        "description": "Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.[3] As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. \r\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It remains within the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as of 2015. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Asperger Syndrome symptoms, Asperger Syndrome management, Asperger Syndrome causes, Asperger Syndrome diagnosis, Asperger Syndrome Prognosis, Asperger Syndrome Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Asperger Syndrome apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Signs and symptoms include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, red, itchy, and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes. The fluid from the nose is usually clear. Symptom onset is often within minutes following exposure and they can affect sleep, the ability to work, and the ability to concentrate at school. Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year. Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis. \r\nAllergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies. Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases the risk. The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies attaching to the allergen and causing the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history in combination with a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies. These tests, however, are sometimes falsely positive.

            "As much as i know its a great game except for my problems. When im stuck and i need help with a hint I always tap the video. Although it never works. It only works once a day. Im not sure if its my device or the game but just trying to notify you. It always says please come again later or check your internet. Ive tryed restarting the game but its dosent work. Ive tryed most things but please update it so it works. Thank you! Oh and also your ad is abit innorpropriate for kids no worry if cant.",
            "I love the game.. but I got stuck in Level 57 and tried getting more bulb things by watching ads for about 15 times... downloaded quick yesterday too... I am trying a lot to load the ad from today 10 o clock but still as are not available... tried everything for this level...love this game but please bring the ads back or I will uninstall this game 😔 3 stars are good for a start 🤪",
            "I honestly thought that i would have a problem with ads with this game but not at all! Its super fun and entertaining! But i got this game off an ad and the ad was a bit... innopropiate. I think maybe to make the ads more kid - friendly. I understand that its funny that the people are naked but its not appropiate for this kind of game. Im not saying you have to change the ads but i just needed to say it.",
            "I don't know what other people are saying by the loading is taking forever,or too many ads. I just downloaded this and it is great not one ad in sight...... yet😂 I take it back I had 4 ads but that's ok only issue is the ad for the game underwear not on. not for younger kids!",
            "Me and my daughter liked the game and we paid for it. I dont like you guys don't let setting difficulty change and skip levels. It's so annoying. Its basically even if you paid for a game you still need to look advertisement for a clue. Other thing you made me sign up that you sharing my progress and othe information to advertisement. Without sign up the game won't start. So there is no button to decline. Also its says you can change it in a setting but you don't have as I said normal settings."

Stuck one one level now where I need to \"expand a bubble\", but my game isn't showing a bubble like the playthrough videos show, so maybe it's a bug? Seconded on the needing to watch an ad for almost everything kinda sucking, but I don't mind so much for rewards",

These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise. \r\nAsthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.

The most common symptoms include: a high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks. In children, there may be nausea and vomiting, but these are not common in adults. Nausea and vomiting occur more commonly in the unrelated infection gastroenteritis, which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as \"stomach flu\" or the \"24-hour flu\". Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure. \r\nThree types of influenza viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, the virus is spread through the airfrom coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative.

        "description": "Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skinoccurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach. \r\nHCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis C Guide, Hepatitis C Disease Management & Hepatitis C Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis C Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal. \r\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite – a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications.

            "This is a cute game, but there are WAAAAAY too many ads! I don't need them forced on me in such an aggressive manner. Everything you do is another ad. Update: I bought the full version advertised, \"ad free\" of the game and you STILL are forced to watch ads. I immediately went for a refund and there wasn't an option. Do NOT let these people steal your money! THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM!",
            "Love the game. Although it has way to many ads, after every round there is a ad. I hate this so I'm giving it 4 stars. Please fix this, and I might come back and change my answer. Besides all the ads this Is a great game so I recommend anyone that likes tricky games and dosent mind lots of ads this game Is for you. But again please fix the ad problem it is getting on my nerves! But I will not delete this app. Thank you",
            "The ads are manageable if you keep your wifi off, and the graphics are cute. The biggest problem is that it just becomes tedious after a while. 2 choices for every level, sometimes logical and sometimes meant to be funny ... but it jusst gets boring really fast.",
            "I uninstalled immediately. After literally 3 seconds of playing a portion of the game, there are two ads: one of which you need to wait 5 seconds to skip, and the other is a full 30 seconds, all after 3 seconds of game play!! Absolutely obnoxious. And then it repeats.",
            "Clicked on only 2 things in the game and was hit with 5 full length adverts. This is just advert city. You have no time to enjoy the game, its just random tap and boom you're bombarded with adverts. I get that adverts fund development but there needs to be a trade off. In this case there is almost zero game and just one advertisement after the other. The hubris of calling this a game and then asking you to rate it after only 2 interactions with the game is staggering."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "I like it and had fun but it made me install one more app and there are adds. I only have one game without adds and I think they should have less adds although it is a fun game over all. I definitely think kids of all ages should play this game. This is an honest review and I really hope doing this helped you. Have a great day. Happy Halloween.",
            "Because you get adverts every 2 seconds and there's men naked and my child is playing this and she says Mummy doesn't need it now and I'm like and it's just it's just complicated and basically I don't get why anyone ever would up like this game and it would know why I rated it 2 stars 0 stars is this game keep carrying on I will I will lose my mind and it will not be or I will never do I will I will like girls go crazy and it will not know for every bone in my body is telling me to let go",
            "A small in game fit in a Bunch of Ads.. TOO MANY ADS It is one of the most pathetic games i might have played. Each level is barely 10 seconds but after each level, there's a 30 seconds ad. And every other thing is just so poorly designed, there's no good gameplay.. there's no good game either.. it's just a few unconnected levels fit around many, many ads",
            "Well I was playing the game and there were so many ads and there 30 seconds ads😠. Then I played it again and it keep on glitching for me I really don't think you should play this game cause it is really annoying 😠. but if you wanna play it play at ur own risk. But if none of this happens to you then your lucky."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I loved this game, played through messenger. Now can't get on. I have had to download the app. I was on 3707, now I need to start over and put up with pop up adds. Messenger had videos that played. That was tolerable but this is terrible. I have requested assistance to get my old game back. But it seems nobody is interested. Game play .... Go Figure, I can't post until every star is filled.",
            "05/10/20: Enjoying this 4 Pics 1 Word game. The only 2 issues were, I couldn't locate the instructions, so when it asked if you wanted to pay to receive a hint, I thought it was with cash, and the Hints took some time to appear. The ads don't bother me too much. 24/10/20: I like the change made where a Free Letter is provided to help figure out the Word.",
            "Used to love this and decided to recently install it again. I was just disappointed with the amount of advertisement that shows up ever few levels. The worse part is that the advertisement is non skippable for 30 seconds! I don't usually mind advertisements but that's just too much. I unistalled it less than 10 minutes of starting the game.",
            "I have played this game on and off for more than 10 years now. I have played it on 5 different telephone. I really enjoy the game. I think the cost for a hint should be about 50 and then each correct answer you get should be around 15 to 20. It seems ludicrous to me to pay 60 points for a hint when you only get for each time you saw off one.",
            "Too many ADs , every other level an AD pops up. I installed after about 10 minutes of playing , after level 29 or so the ADs seemed to be getting longer! I used to love this game a few years ago, now with all the ADs and pop ups it's very annoying."

            "The game itself is pretty much explainable I mean, the game is pretty simple to be fair. The levels aren't as difficult as I thought and, the gameplay is straight forward. I do consider having some certain problems with the game itself though, first the Ads. There are Ads every two Levels and it's really disappointing because you have to spend thirty seconds of your time to watch some pointless Ads. (They make you watch Ads for Money..) And, the Levels aren't challenging enough, please fix this!",
            "The game is aussum and very good this is the game of mind how her level are pass the level goes higher and difficult I loved this game. Good job And please ad very angry but do more facilities such as if we will Completed the level we will something eg coins and from that coins we can take sometimes I game please make the level more interesting .Good content . Actually some words I don't get understand so I need to search of Google what does it means but it's ok I will know new words.",
            "The game itself is good, like it's a good little puzzle game to pass the time, but it's just unplayable due to all the adds. I got 4 adds before it let me complete the first level, then 2 straight after completing it. Fair enough stick a couple ads in now and then, but this is just ridiculous.",
            "These game is awesome. but i give a 4 stare beacaus for the adds. but there is away to not get adds also a hake. its easy just tiren of the connection thien no adds free . but for that the game is cute and awesome and i hope these review is helpful. AND BYE AVRYBODY!!!!!!!!!!",
            "This game is fun but the amount of ads is excessive! I mean an ad after every level, and after level 3, T H R E E, a message pops up and asks me to rate the game. This was so annoying, I clicked on the link and here I am. My rating will go up when the amount of ads go down ⬇️"

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "Most questions good but not too difficult. Two annoyances are: Mini games between levels. Why? They are irrelevant to trivia. The second annoyance is that some of the tiles you are required to play are not trivia, but are simply games of chance. \"Click the chest to get more coins!\" But if you guess wrong, you lose a life...lose too many lives and the game shuts you down. This is super lame.",
            "Very entertaining. Even learning some new things so makes it worth it. Love how you have control over how hard you want the levels to be. That way its not too easy or too hard. Because when there's no level in between i usually just delete the app. It's the perfect game for me before bedtime, its the only game i've found that relaxes me and calms my brain so i can rest and my brain actually shuts off because it's tired. So yes i give 5🌟s thank you for the upload. I'll be keeping this one.",
            "I freaking love it. A bit heavy on the ads but hey, it's free. You can at least watch an ad to get another life once you run out. I don't mind dropping a little $ once I've thoroughly researched an app. Runs smooth other than ads but it's great you're not immediately forced to pay for upgrades before really getting a chance to see if it's really an app for you. Very enjoyable!!",
            "Without doubt the best quiz app out there. I have had some problems with it freezing, I managed to get to level 540 and it would not go any further no matter what I did so I have had to start again from scratch. I've now managed over 100 levels and it's only crashed once so fingers crossed I'll keep my score and history without having to start again.",
            "As games go; this one is pretty good! You only have to watch ads when you get an answer wrong. I am on level 55. Each level has approximately 15+20 questions. You have little mini-games some times. If you win those you are asked if you want to double your score by watching an ad. When you answer a question, right or wrong, it gives an explanation to the question. So you can learn something. It is a little like the original board game of Trivia Pursuit. I think it's a good game."

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",
            "There are a lot of games that are exactly the same, so 0 points for originality, graphics are the bare minimum, kinda cutesy style. The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

Plus you don't have to be connected to the internet to play this so no waisting data if you don't have wifi!! I've always been intrigued by games like this. I wanted to wait until I got along further in the game to comment my honest reply. I'm currently on level 331. At first yes it's VERY EASY, but as it goes on the levels do get harder, but the hints are very helpful!!",

        "description": "Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions. \r\nCommon allergens include pollen and certain food. Metals and other substances may also cause problems.

This isn't a game that I used to want to give 5 stars to. Now, it's an app you download to watch ads. Highly disappointed and will be deleting.",
            "It is a very cool game and when I play it I think it is very good but the reason for me to give it 4 stars is of the horrible ads when you finish a level you have to watch a 10 second ad and if you lose again you have to watch a 10 second ad I will give it 5 star after seeing the result thank you 🤟🤟🤟",
            "🎃👻It's an amazing game despite the adds. I really enjoy it and I have never ever had any problems with it besides the ads because to be honest I don't really ever get any ads and if I do they are like 5-30 seconds. So I recommend you get this game and it's really fun and if you don't want any ads then just turn of your WIFI, if you do that then you won't have to worry about ads coming your way. So, what I'm really trying to say if your looking for a fun game to play with different skins...👻🎃",
            "Too many ads . When I open this game a ad when I close this game again ad when I switch to next level a ad God so many ads 😡 I prefer you to not download this game just a waste time and your Mobile's memory I have given given this 1star because I can't give 0 stars if there was a option to give 0 star I will give",
            "Advertisements after EVERY LEVEL are way too much. The concept is actually pretty cool but you spend as much time watching ads as playing the game. I would even pay a few dollars for an ad-free version but they want a hundred dollars PER YEAR to eliminate these ads."

Symptoms may include headache, vomiting, feeling tired, trouble sleeping, and dizziness. Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) with associated shortness of breath or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) with associated confusion. Chronic mountain sickness may occur after long term exposure to high altitude. \r\nAltitude sickness typically only occurs above 2,500 metres (8,000 ft), though some are affected at lower altitudes. Risk factors include a prior episode of altitude sickness, a high degree of activity, and a rapid increase in elevation. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and is supported in those who have more than a minor reduction in activities. \r\nPrevention is by gradually increasing elevation by no more than 300 metres (1,000 ft) per day. Being physical fit does not decrease the risk. Treatment is generally by descending to a lower altitude and sufficient fluids. Mild cases may be helped by ibuprofen, acetazolamide, or dexamethasone.

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

        "description": "Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the connective tissue which supports the arch of the foot. It results in pain in the heel and bottom of the foot that is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest.

Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. While rates are similar for males and females the underlying causes often differ. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. \r\nBurns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burnt area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone.

Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms.

        "description": "Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people have no symptoms whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes, poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Hepatitis may be temporary (acute) or long term (chronic) depending on whether it lasts for less than or more than six months. Acute hepatitis can sometimes resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or rarely result in acute liver failure. Over time the chronic form may progress to scarring of the liver, liver failure, or liver cancer. \r\nThe most common cause of hepatitis worldwide is viruses. Other causes include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There are five main types of viral hepatitis: type A, B, C, D, and E. Hepatitis A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Both hepatitis B and C are commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users. Hepatitis D can only infect people already infected with hepatitis B. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis Guide, Hepatitis Disease Management & Hepatitis Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate.",

What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

Small white spots known as Koplik's spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms.

It may also be spread through contact with saliva or nasal secretions. Nine out of ten people who are not immune and share living space with an infected person will catch it.

            "Could mix things up a little. Have different goals, maybe some times levels, maybe some with more differences. Otherwise a good solid play, not overtaken by ads & so far, no political ads!!",
            "Challenging and great pictures. Very clear and interesting photography. Zoom is helpful and pictures don't blur when using it. I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",
            "Fun game, pictures are great. Would love if it told you where the pictures were taken. I would recommend this Find the Differences game",
            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

Older people may have headaches, double vision, poor balance, urinary incontinence, personality changes, or mental impairment. In babies there may be a rapid increase in head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, seizures, and downward pointing of the eyes. Hydrocephalus can occur due to birth defects or be acquired later in life. Associated birth defects include neural tube defects and those that result in aqueductal stenosis. Other causes include meningitis, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, intraventricular hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. There are four types of hydrocephalus: communicating, non-communicating, ex-vacuo, and normal pressure. Diagnosis is typically made by examination and medical imaging.",

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "They actually did a pretty good job of adapting it to the smaller screen on the phone. The puzzle is done in sections. You can choose the number of pieces, turn rotation on or off and change the scale. I LOVE the background music by Ruslan Gumbatov! There are daily puzzles and missions but I don't bother with those, I play it to relax, not to collect rewards.",
            "I've loved this app for a long time now and it's one of the few that I even bought! **Edit**Oct 17 (dropped to 3 stars) I'm disappointed in the new layout of the daily and My Puzzle packs. I liked when the preview of each puzzle was larger and you scrolled through them left or right. Now the daily puzzle preview is so tiny I find it difficult to see. The preview of all puzzle packs, also don't scroll anymore. I liked that hovering over one, enlarged it in preview mode. Miss those features!",
            "Decent puzzle game overall, but there are not enough free puzzle packs! Also packs are expensive to get using coins (which are slow to get but the quests help), a VIP membership is pretty much necessary to have full access to puzzles and that membership is very expensive. But you can easily play a wide variety of user generated puzzles, these are generally not as good as the puzzles created by the devs but some are good! To top it off graphics and controls are nice and simple!",
            "*edit* The adverts keep crashing the game. I watch an advert to do a puzzle and after a few minutes the advert in the sidebar freezes up, freezing the game. I finally get the game to close and reloaded, and I have to watch another advert to restart the puzzle, and the game lasts about a minute before crashing again! This is normally a really relaxing game, but its about to go away.",
            "Your app has sucked since the beginning of september, cant play daily puzzle. Fix it. Update new fix didn't work. Still can't play daily puzzle. Game freezes when you try. You can only play one puzzle then freezes when you go to daily task and prize chest. 😵uninstalled and reinstalled. Still freezes when i try to play daily puzzle. And now i lost all puzzles i had bought"

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

        "description": "Use this app to learn about the symptoms of HIV and more about the virus\r\n\r\nWhat is HIV?\r\n\r\nHIV is a virus that damages the immune system. The immune system helps the body fight off infections. Untreated HIV infects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cells. Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of infections and cancers. \r\n\r\nHIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:\r\n\r\n    blood\r\n    semen\r\n    vaginal and rectal fluids\r\n    breast milk\r\n\r\nThe virus doesn’t spread in air or water, or through casual contact.\r\n\r\nStages of HIV\r\n\r\n    stage 1: acute stage, the first few weeks after transmission\r\n    stage 2: clinical latency, or chronic stage\r\n    stage 3: AIDS\r\n\r\nHIV is a lifelong condition and currently there is no cure, although many scientists are working to find one. However, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.\r\n\r\nWithout treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called AIDS. At that point, the immune system is too weak to fight off other diseases and infections. Untreated, life expectancy with AIDS is about three years Trusted Source. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-controlled and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.\r\n\r\nIt’s estimated that 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 5 don’t know they have the virus.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top 20 countries with people living with Hiv\r\n\r\nSwaziland\r\nLesotho\r\nBotswana\r\nSouth Africa\r\nNamibia\r\nZimbabwe\r\nZambia\r\nMozambique\r\nMalawi\r\nUganda\r\nEquatorial Guinea\r\nKenya\r\nTanzania\r\nCentral African Republic\r\nCameroon\r\nGabon\r\nBahamas, \r\nThe\tCongo, \r\nRepublic of the Guinea-Bissau\r\nRwanda\r\n\r\nHIV can cause changes throughout the body. Learn about the effects of HIV on the different systems in the body.\r\n\r\n What is AIDS?\r\n\r\nAIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean they’ll develop AIDS.\r\n\r\nHIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below 200 per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.\r\n\r\nA person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an opportunistic infection or cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV. An opportunistic infection, such as pneumonia, is one that takes advantage of a unique situation, such as HIV.\r\n\r\nUntreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about three years Trusted Source. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.\r\n\r\nIf AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised. It’s weakened to the point where it can no longer fight off most diseases and infections. That makes the person vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:\r\n\r\n    pneumonia\r\n    tuberculosis\r\n    oral thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth or throat\r\n    cytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus\r\n    cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection in the brain\r\n    toxoplasmosis, a brain infection caused by a parasite\r\n    cryptosporidiosis, an infection caused by an intestinal parasite\r\n    cancer, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma\r\n\r\nThe shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it’s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS. Learn more about possible complications that can arise from HIV and AIDS.\r\n\r\nFor more information you can write us via email\r\ndeveloper.imastudio@gmail.com",

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

            "Great game, its a good way to pass the time. Bit difficult to grasp what to do in the beginning but once you get the hang of it then its great fun. 30/10/2020 Um.... what happened guys? This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

It is divided into neck pain (cervical), middle back pain (thoracic), lower back pain (lumbar) or coccydynia (tailbone or sacral pain) based on the segment affected. The lumbar area is the most common area for pain, as it supports most of the weight in the upper body. Episodes of back pain may be acute, sub-acute, or chronic depending on the duration. The pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. Discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms.\r\nBack pain can originate from the muscles, nerves, bones, joints or other structures in the spine. Internal structures such as the gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back.\r\nBack pain is common, with about nine out of ten adults experiencing it at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults having it every year. Some estimate up to 95% of Americans will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. It is the most common cause of chronic pain, and is a major contributor of missed work and disability. However, it is rare for back pain to be permanently disabling. In most cases of herniated disks and stenosis, rest, injections or surgery have similar general pain resolution outcomes on average after one year. In the United States, acute low back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits and causes 40% of missed days off work.

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

Lazy and somehow a boring game. How the hell do you do that?! Kudos to the \"developers\" for whatever this was, it was something while it lasted. Move on and get something actually interesting.",
            "I enjoyed the game. However, the adds are a bit excessive. Yes, yes I know, adds are what enable you to continue to bring us these glorious games for free. I get it. And yet... They are excessive. What good are adds when a person such as myself deletes your game... Because the adds are excessive?",
            "This game is super fun. There aren't many ads which is awesome. The game has simple words and it doesn't show the stick figure escaping which is not really fun. But other than that, it is a fun game.",
            "This app is one of the best apps I've used so on. This is a perfect game/app for learning and having fun. Not only me myself, but my whole family enjoyed the game. Only for this app, we had a great time all along. The little cut scenes are just so fun and mind blowing. Who says what about this, in my opinion, it's one of the best apps all around."

            "I actually played this since last year. I was happy when the update released but my only request is to bring back the old shield in spearton. It was cool but after the before update, the shield was circle and round. It kinda looked bad for me in my opinion so I just want the old one back. But overall, The game is so good and I love the game modes and levels. I hope soon there will be a new troop called the jet force which it will only defend only the base. I just wanted a flying troop. 😊",
            "I have been playing this game, since you copied the stick war game in Y8 and also since when I was 7 years old, but I still love this game, I know every possible way to defeat every levels without thousands of gems, the other players don't understand what they're playing, because they don't know strategy. So my request is I need 6 lines on my men, not 4, like in the stick war in Y8, I need more men to line in 6 lines, that is only my request, I need 6 lines in a formation.",
            "Its a game that is addicting you leave you think your done with it .....but your not. You just keep seeing it and endup downloading and undownloading again and again untill u just leave it installed to play when ever you wont. One of the game s I have left on and countiue to have in ever new phone I get. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is cause its to addicting.",
            "I love this game. I love how you can play as each individual character, it doesnt make the game feel like an idle game. It would be great if you guys can add more characters which then means you add more campaigns. Id suggest adding a flying character, horsemen, samurais and etc. I like the theme of the game where it sticks to historical and non fiction characters. All in all, great game. Keep it up 👍",
            "The campaign is okay. The tournament & weekly missions are VERY P2W. You can use flawless tactics & the enemy is designed to come with such overwhelming force that after normal mode, if you don't spend thousands of currency to win... You're CRUSHED with impunity. It would be a decent game otherwise. Good for 10 hours of play time. Move along quick."

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

        "description": "Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by Borrelia bacteria, spread by ticks. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that appears at the site of the tick bite about a week after it occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25–50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people develop joint pains, memory problems, and feel tired for at least six months. \r\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes. Usually, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours before the bacteria can spread. In North America, Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii are the cause. In Europe and Asia, the bacteria Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are also causes of the disease. The disease does not appear to be transmissible between people, by other animals, or through food. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Lyme Guide, Lyme Disease Management & Lyme Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Lyme Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

        "title": "Skin Disease Treatment Symptoms and Diagnosis 2019",
        "description": "Skin Disease Treatments provides medical treatments info including rosacea. \r\nPeople say that beauty’s only skin deep; it’s what’s on the “inside” that counts. Our insides are certainly important, but skin treatment is your first layer of defense against the outside world. Skin can also give important clues to your overall health. Learn to take good care of your skin, so your skin can keep taking good care of you. \r\nSkin protects your body in many ways. The skin provides a barrier to protect the body from invasion by bacteria and other possible environmental hazards that can be dangerous for human health.\r\n\r\nSkin can also alert you to a health problem. A red, itchy rash might signal allergies or skin diseases, and a red “butterfly” rash on your face might be a sign of lupus. A yellow tint might indicate liver disease. And dark or unusual moles might be a warning sign of skin cancer. Be on the lookout for unexpected changes to your clear skin, and talk with your skin doctor if you have concerns.\r\n\r\nYour skin can become too dry if you don’t drink enough fluids or spend too much time in sunny or dry conditions. While washing hands is important for good hygiene, washing your hands too much can also lead to dry skin.\r\n\r\nThe sun can damage your skin as well. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) light that causes sunburn and makes your skin age faster, leading to more wrinkles as you get older. There’s a strong link between UV exposure and skin cancer. So protect your skin from the sun. Wear hats and other protective clothing, use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, and restrict your time in the sun during the late morning and early afternoon hours, when sunlight is strongest.\r\n\r\nMany skin researchers are studying the skin’s microbiome—the bacteria and other microscopic organisms that live on your skin. Some of these microbes can be helpful. Evidence suggests that they boost the body’s infection-fighting immune system and help keep you healthy. But there are some skin diseases with known associations with certain microbes. In the long run, scientists would like to find ways to support healthy skin microbes while reducing harmful ones.\r\n\r\nThe importance of keeping your skin healthy can't be overemphasized. It's the body's first defense against disease and morgellons, and it protects your internal organs from injuries. It is, in fact, the largest organ in the body. The skin helps regulate body temperature and prevents excess fluid loss, and it also helps your body remove excess water and salt.\r\n\r\nSkin conditions can affect anyone—young and old, men and women. Acne, hyperhidrosis and eczema are just a few examples of common skin disorders. The good news is that there are soap notes and a number of simple ways to keep skin healthy, and there also are now many options available to treat skin conditions, if treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer : If you think you may have a skin problem or need to learn how to better care for your skin, consultation with a dermatologist—a physician who specializes in treating the skin and keeping it healthy—may be in order. Don’t use this guide for main diagnose medical books. Skin problems can be difficult to diagnose because many skin conditions share similar symptoms. An evaluation is key to effective treatment.",

A red, itchy rash might signal allergies or skin diseases, and a red “butterfly” rash on your face might be a sign of lupus. A yellow tint might indicate liver disease. And dark or unusual moles might be a warning sign of skin cancer. Be on the lookout for unexpected changes to your clear skin, and talk with your skin doctor if you have concerns.<br><br>Your skin can become too dry if you don’t drink enough fluids or spend too much time in sunny or dry conditions. While washing hands is important for good hygiene, washing your hands too much can also lead to dry skin.<br><br>The sun can damage your skin as well. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) light that causes sunburn and makes your skin age faster, leading to more wrinkles as you get older. There’s a strong link between UV exposure and skin cancer. So protect your skin from the sun. Wear hats and other protective clothing, use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, and restrict your time in the sun during the late morning and early afternoon hours, when sunlight is strongest.<br><br>Many skin researchers are studying the skin’s microbiome—the bacteria and other microscopic organisms that live on your skin. Some of these microbes can be helpful. Evidence suggests that they boost the body’s infection-fighting immune system and help keep you healthy. But there are some skin diseases with known associations with certain microbes. In the long run, scientists would like to find ways to support healthy skin microbes while reducing harmful ones.<br><br>The importance of keeping your skin healthy can&#39;t be overemphasized. It&#39;s the body&#39;s first defense against disease and morgellons, and it protects your internal organs from injuries. It is, in fact, the largest organ in the body. The skin helps regulate body temperature and prevents excess fluid loss, and it also helps your body remove excess water and salt.<br><br>Skin conditions can affect anyone—young and old, men and women. Acne, hyperhidrosis and eczema are just a few examples of common skin disorders. The good news is that there are soap notes and a number of simple ways to keep skin healthy, and there also are now many options available to treat skin conditions, if treatment is necessary.<br><br>Disclaimer : If you think you may have a skin problem or need to learn how to better care for your skin, consultation with a dermatologist—a physician who specializes in treating the skin and keeping it healthy—may be in order. Don’t use this guide for main diagnose medical books. Skin problems can be difficult to diagnose because many skin conditions share similar symptoms. An evaluation is key to effective treatment.",

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",
            "This game is overall satisfying but the controls are clunky. I wish that you could decorate your cake but I like this game. And why is this PEGI 18!!!",

Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. \r\nConstipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation.

        "description": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disease. Approximately one percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime - more than two million Americans suffer from the illness in any given year. Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties; women are generally affected in the twenties to early thirties. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behaviour can be disorganised and strange to the extent that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others.\r\n\r\nHow is Schizophrenia Diagnosed?\r\n\r\nThere is currently no physical or lab test that can conclusively diagnose schizophrenia - a psychiatrist usually makes the diagnosis based on clinical symptoms. Physical testing can rule out many other conditions (seizure disorders, metabolic disorders, thyroid dysfunction, brain tumour, the effects of street drug use, and so on) that sometimes have similar symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhat causes Schizophrenia?\r\n\r\nAlthough the exact cause of schizophrenia remains unknown, experts agree that schizophrenia develops as a result of interplay between biological predisposition (for example, inheriting certain genes) and environmental factors. These lines of research are beginning to converge: brain development disruption is likely the result of genetic and/or environmental stressors early in development (during pregnancy or early childhood), leading to subtle alterations in the brain. Environmental factors later in development can either damage the brain further and further increase the risk of schizophrenia, or lessen the expression of genetic or neurodevelopment defects, thus decreasing the risk of schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nTreatment for schizophrenia\r\n\r\nThe American Psychiatric Association publication 'Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia' states: \"Antipsychotic medications are indicated for nearly all acute psychotic episodes in patients with schizophrenia.\"\r\n\r\nThere is also a significant overlap in terms of the medications for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Manic Depression).\r\nThere are two main classifications of medications (from a layman's perspective); the traditional antipsychotic medications (Haldol, etc.), and the newer, 'atypical' antipsychotic medications that have come out in the past decade (Clozapine, Geodon, Seroquel, Risperdal, Zyprexa, Abilify, etc.). It is recommended that sufferers or their carers speak to online support groups to get in touch with others, and to hear about their personal successes and problems with the different medications. It is also a good idea to read as much as possible regarding the medications available, and talk with a psychiatrist, to identify the medications that may be appropriate. It should be kept in mind that whilst both the older and newer medications can greatly help a person with schizophrenia, they all have significant side effects that vary according to the individual. No medication available, unfortunately, constitutes an actual cure for schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nA natural treatment for schizophrenia?\r\n\r\nWhile the conclusions drawn range from the positive to the negative, research does suggest that people with schizophrenia may benefit by a reduction in symptoms when they take fish oil capsules that are high in the EPA (a type of Omega-3 fatty acid) form of oil.

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

Another app had their puzzles according to different subjects so if you didn't know anything about that particular subject you were lost. The easy ones are hard enough for me but I like that you have a choice for people that might be more skilled in crosswords. (Smarter than I am!)",

It's still a great crossword game, It's a simple design, user friendly, it costs nothing to use hints. Which is great for anyone who wants to unwind. Not everyone knows who the star of \"touched by an angel\" is. And that's ok! You don't need to know. Use the hints that don't require you to watch ads, spend coins, wait (X amount) time or cost you money. Be free & relax 😊",
            "Used to be great, but now ads are too intrusive. Before, a simple silent ad would pop up and you could tap through it. Fairly low annoyance factor. Now, massive full-screen ads with obnoxiously loud audio FORCE you to watch videos for games you don't want. The frequency of the ads has increased too. The game is great otherwise, with a solid easy interface and good features. Used to be a lot of fun but I am sadly going to have to uninstall."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

I recommend this game for you, but if you can improve the movement of the characters: the way they dodge and throw a punch and allow us to make a combination like throwing two jabs and then uppercut. Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",

            "What a miserable \"game\". The devs trap you into turning WiFi on to progress to the next level so I just turned it on, pressed the button and turned it off as soon as I was in the level. Which may I add are pathetically easy. This is the bare bones minimum for a game, and I took joy out of every penny I did not give the greedy bastards who made this loathsome pile of garbage.",
            "Scam. As mentioned in other reviews, unplayable because of the insane number of ad pop-ups. So, I go to the Home screen and find an option for \"ad-free\" for $2.99. Ok, I bite.... It's less than a cup of coffee. Am I add-free? Not even close! But got another purchase option 'bundle' for $4.99 to go add-free. Thought that was what I just paid for! No option to give this a negative star rating.",
            "I like that you had the good sense to create the game that everyone else has falsely advertised for. It is very fun and engaging. I like the puzzles and the story line that comes with them. However, the amount of ads is excessive. I'm on the 20th-ish level but I've seen like 35 ads between level 1 and 20. I also noticed that if the storyline cutscenes are too long, my screen cuts out. I think if you fix those 2 things you'll have a great success.",
            "Awful Game! The play is too easy and takes only seconds to finish each level, which makes sense since the main goal of the developer is to make lots of time for the pervasive amount of ads. This should actually be a zero star \"game\". I use the word 'game' loosely since this is merely one long commercial with three- second-long breaks to play a game my infant niece could figure out. Don't waste your time or money!",
            "The game seemed like it would be fun but in the first 10 minutes of game play i spent at least 8 minutes watching ads i understand developers need to make money too, but I refuse to play a game that has obnoxious levels of forced advertising. Unless you enjoy spending most of your time watching ads and very little time playing the game I recommend finding another game."

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "My experience with Word Connect is fairly limited. I`ve only played it for about 8 hours, much less than the 30 - 40 hours I'd normally play a game before giving a review of it. I like the bonus frequency, amounts of the bonus', and variety of characters. Games are challenging and hints are very helpful. Well, off I go to hopefully complete another level. Good Luck everyone.",
            "Too many ads and some that run too long. Been playing this game for over 4 years and it used to be my favorite game, but now it is my least liked game due to the ads and too many game competitions. It needs a feature that allows players to communicate with one another or the developer via chat or something similar for either questions, concerns, assistance, etc. I don't mind ads, but not ads that take up more time than playing the game. Wish the developer would consider these changes.",
            "Love it. Very challenging. I play everyday. Gets a little tougher the more you play. In love with this game. This game is very mentally challenging. I'm addicted. can't stop playing. Got my husband playing with me.Great way to pass time and I'm learning new words. I am truly addicted. Still playing everyday. Can't wait to beat the daily challenge. So much fun. Joined a team. Adds alot of fun.",
            "I like the game, mostly. But, I often spend twice as much time waiting for the ads to run than I actually do playing. And, a lot of the ads run consecutively. For things I have no need of (seriously, a man having to watch women's?!?) Plus, there are a lot of words that don't seem to be in the dictionary. The scoring is strange. Often it's by the word, not the complexity. So you get more points for 5 3-letter words than for 1 7-letter one. But it's fun, and can be challenging.",
            "Good most of the time but frustrating in a couple of areas. For example, it won't accept all words, only those that have been predetermined. There are glitches in the reward system ... too often you get a message saying 'Oops, there was a problem' and you don't get the opportunity to claim your point rewards. In team challenges there are usually 20 out of 50 people who contribute absolutely nothing but still get equal rewards. If you can overlook these, then it's an entertaining game."

            "I don't understand what's the complaint regarding some colours needed to pay $. Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enough🤔🙄🤬😤🧐🙃😒😠👎👈",
            "Even though I know it costs alot of money for myself its worth every penny! Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off 🤔 And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself 😊 Jackie"

            "Bunch of ads and a terrible energy system, which basically let's you start a one puzzle per day, unless you pay or watch even more ads (if there weren't enough already). One puzzle takes around 10 minutes to complete, so there you have it - play for 19 minutes, wait 24 hrs, play for 10 minutes again, wait another 24 hrs etc. Honestly you can find much better games out there and I hope you do. I'm not saying this particular game is bad, but its monetization is just terrible. ... Please fix.",
            "In my initial review, I talked about the long ads between each group. Since then there is a way to shorten the ad after only 3-5 seconds. So my update is to say that this is a really fun take on a crossword puzzle and the fact that the developers listened and worked out a solution gives the game a solid 5 stars. Thank you for responding and for working to find a solution!",
            "I have a Samsung Note9 but this game uses too much battery and makes my phone hot. I love, love, love this game so these facts make me sad. UPDATE: some of the ads (which I do not mind watching since they let me play for free, I can't afford to pay) but some of the ads are freezing the game. Please fix these issues. I do not want to delete. Have a blessed day",
            "I like this game, but there are too many ads. Each game takes 2 tokens and there aren't enough ways to gain tokens. It would be best to find ways to motivate people to play the game. Do fun games where they can win more tokens. Way too many ads!! Before you can play. After you play. Its crazy and a waste of time. Otherwise I really like this game and would probably keep playing of the ad situation can be made better.",
            "I love this game.Awsome,wonderful,amazing,superb😊😊😘😘😚.This might be the best game among all crossword games.There are even powerups to help if we are unable to find the word for a question.Very nice wonderful game.But the only thing is ,it works so slow if my data pack is over.I wish it to be work fast though my data pack is over .Hence i gave 4 stars. Apart from this ,it a awesome game .Loved it.🤗🤗"

Also add some more cues please I seem to have all of the current list. I like the star difficulty system, but could there be a player star amount? To see how skilled you get? Great game, I love it!!!!",
            "poor controls, limited items on store, i expect to have tables in store but there is nothing. pls expand the store. and add more levels in 8ball and 9 ball module. and pls add a reward redeem module that will allow us to buy items using tickets",
            "Don't waste your time until they get the controls right. Power bar changes your aim. Needs more work.",
            "Great game but takes your shot away. By this i mean if u hit the lowest ball first, it says that u didnt hit that ball. In 9 ball",

            "Good relaxing game but a lot of the challenges are on repeat or have multiple of the same ones. Currently on advanced level and keep seeing the same puzzles over and over again with each one i do. Wish there were larger more complicated ones with more variety. Its a bit too easy and a little boring. Still helps when im having anxiety though.",
            "This game is amazing!! But there is a flaw, the ads ughh! Its really really annoying . But this game would be a perfect game without the ads l tried to turn off my internet but the game cannot play without the internet.On the another side you should try it,or tell others about this game because it is awesome,amazing and wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!BYE💑💃😻💑💑💑",
            "It's cool and relaxing, but the ads can be annoying. Hopefully, it's just 1$. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cuz of the sound effect when you win a level. Early levels are a breeze but it gets very annoying. A relaxing game should have a relaxing sfx not an overused indie win sfx. Either that or complete silence. I like the sound of the blocks touching each other but the win? So unfitting. And you can't turn off that specific sound. It's all or nothing. Smh",
            "The ads aren't really too bad. Unless there's been changes since some of the old reviews, you're looking at 1 ad every 3-4 levels (which can be skipped after 5 seconds) The game itself is a nice, satisfying mental workout. A good time killer and a bit addicting. Controls are fluid and intuitive, the difficulties are categorized properly, the quest for optimal solves is great. This is a hidden gem.",
            "Good puzzle game . I play when I have a bit of mild anxiety and it helps me concentrate. There isn't many ads at all so I don't get annoyed with that . Overall it's a 10/10 peaceful game . For free I have no complaints at all . Thanks."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "I enjoy word search games, regardless of level, obscurity of words, difficulty, simplicity, etc. My only negative about any game has more to do with appearance. There's something about this game that makes it uncomfortable to play for very long. Whether it's the size of the letters (almost too big) or the spacing, I don't know for sure. I had to use the dark screen option and that helped a little. Also, once many words are found, the letters become obscured by the pastel \"mark off\" stripes.",
            "What's not to love about this app?? The ads stay on top of screen (no annoying video that pops up), easy settings, a great mix of words, simple design, and extremely easy to use. The only thing I would say is that I wish the \"dark setting\" would make the whole screen black. However, that's not enough for me to make it lose a star. It's nice having a simple crossword puzzle that's easy on the eyes. Definitely recommend 👍",
            "I like it, but they repeat the same words. Maybe have a theme for each puzzle, and the words pertain to the puzzle....",

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "I love this game so much ❤❤but it really needs some upgrades like eggs and cakes and many more desserts and you should also give more utensils and dishes and a sink too like a REAL KITCHEN! !! That will make this game 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆. You should also give more guests. This game really need a update to be 5 stars and I will be eagerly waiting for it. And it is so nice of you that you have not added any adds and I hope in the next update also we will not find a single add.",
            "It's so good I like it but the costumers is so ugly.",
            "Game keeps crashing after i play it for 1 minute",
            "It's a good game. Fun to play, interesting. Only problem is that more ingredients can be included, more cooking methods, and easier stuff. Especially issue is characters. I would like to have more characters. Maybe ones we made in hair salon can come here, like a linked game. Other than that it is funny and entertaining. Certainly you can download. But plz check on characters too."

I've seen words that can Only be swiped one way sometimes words are in (2) places & the challenging part you must find the word where the game wants you to. Must have patience gets more challenging later as you go along. Continues to have easy larger print puzzles along with smaller print puzzles they're assorted. Then this has many more words in the smaller print puzzles as you go along.",
            "It won't let you highlight a word backwards, and if the word is, by accident, in the puzzle twice it will only take the one it has been programmed to accept as correct. Too simple for me. Maybe it was designed for second or third grade children.",

            "Firstly, I intend to buy the no-ads feature. That being said, I'm judging this on the assumption I shouldn't have to for a decent experience. Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",
            "Fun but the ads were annoying. I'd rather have a long ad that I can't skip than short ones every few seconds. I can't take it anymore. Uninstalling",
            "I bought the ad free version but it doesn't give you the option to sign in when downloaded to a new device and Google Play says I already own it and can't buy it again, not that I want to pay for it again.",
            "This is a really boring game. I hate it soooooooooo much and it's very annoying because you could only stick the couple a million bazillion times anyways make this game fun or exciting. Oof edited this and still it's so BORING and ANNOYING. Please upgrade it."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

            "Awful. This used to be a really relaxing game that I loved playing. Imagine my dismay when I open the game one day to see all my progress had disappeared (over 2000 levels played.) Instead, it has been replaced by non-relaxing garbage that begs for you to pay over £5 a week in subscription and randomly replaces progress you've made with cheap feeling graphics. Disappointed and uninstalling",
            "Too many ads considering the length of the levels. I understand developers need to earn money, but when I spend more time on ads than playing the game, that's a developer failure no matter how fun the game is.",
            "Used to like this game, but just lately there are levels that dont work properly or move to quick so you can not get all the stars. New to fix the problems on some of the levels.",
            "Really not happy as when I get 2 the bar that the water should fill 2 press 2 open the bar doesn't work @ all, never so then I have problems skipping the level as it plays up + doesn't work either so I'm having 2 uninstall + re install 2 play the game again with no WiFi 🤬😠😠",
            "I love this game. Its fun,for me entertaining,and the best thing if all,its bit filled with adverts. Really everything is good with the game. I'm not saying there isnt any ads, I'm just saying theres not a bunch of them."

            "I like the new layout and look. However, I would give 5 stars if I didn't have to search for what comes through on the alert notifications. Example, \"there's a special loan offer\", where?! I have search for it, when the app should go right to the information that is on alert notification, and not just the home page. Many alerts I just ignore, because I become frustrated trying to find them. Just open directly to them once pressed, otherwise I'm just wasting time seeing the same information.",
            "I really love this app and the website. It's convenient and easy to use. My only complaint right now it that no matter how many times I click on \"Recommendations\" and scroll through it, it ALWAYS says there is 1 waiting. It's been going on for a while and it's on both desktop and mobile, so I know it's not just this latest update to the app. I don't like the advertising of the credit cards all the time but I get it, to keep the app free you need to have ads, no problem. Recommend me stuff all the time, I don't care, just register that I've seen it once I have.",
            "Great app, I mean ausome app, in less than a year, this app has helped me get all three of my credit scores boosted. They were all between 510-530 and now, only a year later all three range from 622-643. So this app has done wonders. After a year of doing what the app said I went from having no credit to having 3 credit cards and owning a house. SO CREDIT KARMA GETS A 10 STAR RATING FROM ME. I USED TO SPEND MONEY AS FAST AS IT HIT MY POCKET NOW I HAVE OVER 10,000 IN SAVINGS AND I'M A PACK RAT.",
            "Good app, but this latest update sucks. I don't like the new UI, and it feels slower now. And one thing that's been bugging me forever, when you open the app and it displays where you enter your pin, raise all the numbers up. It's way too low. But the in app UI sucks now. Change it back please. It was easier on the eyes before and easier to read",

Not to mention, your score in the app will never be what a lender pulls. So I just use it to monitor credit card usage and any collections. Other than that, the app is garbage. Edit to include CK's response: I already know that. I am informing others, because clearly your formula isn't accurate. And if it's not accurate... it's not useful."

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",

I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "This game is ok I would never play this in my freetime, and I don't like the animaton. It's terrible and the animation sucks! It looks like the creator just rushed it when it could have been a good game but you rushed it. If your pregnant and you want to learn about being pregnant I do recommend, but for all of you that are not, look at something else!!!",
            "The is perfect for pregnant women. It teaches you everything i am very proud of the creators. But the reason i reduced a star because you cannot operate the woman that's a little disappointing. Creators if you are reading this its a humble request to add this feature please please. I love this game and i dont want to uninstall it.",
            "Very good game...portrays a pregnant mother's life accurately. Excellent! The only thing is that I felt the 'Baby Care' level a bit boring. The rest was all excellent! Going to hospital, ordering items from iPhone....very good. Just improve 'Baby Care' level and then include more and more of levels...overall, nice game!👍👍 sufficient to get 4 stars!!",
            "FINALLY A GAME WITH EASY CONTROLS !!!!!! I love this game I just wish it had more levels and more to do so far everything is so accurate! Maybe giving baby a bath more levels of baby getting older feeding him in a high chair changing clothes etc mom cooking going to the store taking baby for a walk in stroller or if baby grows and walks as a toddler take him to play ! I'm just glad theres no timer either ! I totally love this game so I'll keep it downloaded and wait for more levels ! Great game!",
            "This app is amazing the little details are so incredible! It feels so realistic however there are some small issues in my opinion I don't understand why when you buy clothes on the pregnancy app it shows dresses and a t-shirt, if she can only wear the track suits why not just have her buy the track suits instead of the dresses? Also it's a little annoying that when you have a baby boy he's in a super girly nursery I think all the baby stuff should had been made gender neutral. Great game tho!"

The guide online is not an accurate reflection of the app. When searching for a printer, it searches without giving me any additional options, and always says the printer is not found. It might be a good app, but i can't use it!",

Dont know why. But very happy with that."

            "Fun Game, Too Many Ads. Finished a level? Watch an ad. Don't want an ad? Here's one anyway. Here's another ad, I didn't skip the last one fast enough. Way too much. I timed it and for every 2 minutes of actual gameplay, I had 3 minutes 48 seconds of total ads",
            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "Interesting game, graphics and sound good but, inability to move to the next stage though I was qualified, by winning in the previous stage and also investing the needed amount, is a put off... So please I hope you would work on it ASAP. Then I will give 5 stars",
            "Well the game is petty good but when i get a wide open 90% it misses and i cant stand that and when you go for a dunk it automatically just like looks like you're doing a layup but like why does it have to be in slow motion and when I go to unlock character I mean a new ball it just new ball action or or closed it just says new ball a lot and then he doesn't even show nothing like the game and then I'll give you a 5-star rating because this game should be like NBA 2K 20",
            "This is great, but I don't like the graphics of this game ,I'm dizzy by it's movements and the worst of all even I'm gonna dunk,shoot in 3 it won't shoot please fix it. So for now I'm giving it a 3. Until you fix it.",
            "The game is good and enjoyable but when ever I want to pass I will send it to my men but it will go to the other team please fix it but it is a good game i am sure that people will like it"

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."
