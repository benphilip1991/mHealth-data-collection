Once you have symptoms like those detailed below you may want to ask your OB/GYN for an ultrasound exam to confirm that ovarian cysts are the cause. The common signs of ovarian cysts are:\r\n\r\nLower abdominal pain\r\nPain during sex\r\nPressure on the bladder/need to urinate more frequently\r\nBloating\r\nIndigestion\r\nIrregular cycles and anovulatory cycles (when ovulation does not occur)\r\n\r\nA ruptured ovarian cyst will cause you high fever and pain. Often women who experience this will go to the ER and will often be checked for appendicitis first. It’s best to be aware that a ruptured ovarian cyst could also be the cause of such pain, if you have experienced the above symptoms prior to this happening.",

The common signs of ovarian cysts are:<br><br>Lower abdominal pain<br>Pain during sex<br>Pressure on the bladder/need to urinate more frequently<br>Bloating<br>Indigestion<br>Irregular cycles and anovulatory cycles (when ovulation does not occur)<br><br>A ruptured ovarian cyst will cause you high fever and pain. Often women who experience this will go to the ER and will often be checked for appendicitis first. It’s best to be aware that a ruptured ovarian cyst could also be the cause of such pain, if you have experienced the above symptoms prior to this happening.",

Many people even have cysts that come and go during their cycle. Some cysts, though, can be painful or indicative of other problems. Learn to recognize the symptoms of an ovarian cyst, and work with your doctor to figure out the best treatment plan for you.

It’s the fifth deadliest cancer for women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.  Although it can affect women of all ages, it mainly develops in older women – in fact, half of all cases affect women aged 63 or older. Women at an elevated risk because of family history are more likely to develop ovarian cancer at an earlier age.   As many as 20% of ovarian cancer cases are genetic and could be prevented if people took action early. The best ways to determine if you are at an elevated risk for ovarian cancer is to learn about your family cancer history or to ask your doctor about genetic testing.

CAM is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care. \r\n\r\nPeople use CAM therapies for a variety of reasons including:\r\n• To help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain, and fatigue\r\n• To comfort themselves and ease the worries of cancer treatment and related stress\r\n• To feel that they are doing something more to help with their own care\r\n• To try to treat or cure their cancer\r\n\r\nThese therapies aim to treat the body and the mind.\r\n \r\nIf you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your Cancer, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. It is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. \r\n\r\nIs there Cancer cure through Baking Soda?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage your Cancer is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in managing Cancer with alternative techniques.\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments. \r\n\r\nIs any of your loved ones suffering from Lung, throat, skin, breast, prostate, colon, bladder, ovarian, liver, cervical Cancer, or testicular Cancer..? Do you want to know the signs, symptoms or Cancer survival rate? \r\n \r\nThis app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your Cancer and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care. This is a Wellness app which you can do it yourself. However one may need Medical or Expert advice for certain protocols. We have protocols for Acupressure, Acupuncture, Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Bach Flower Remedy, Color Therapy, Diet and Nutrition, Exercise, Herbal Therapy, Juice Therapy, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Shiatsu, Sound Therapy, Tai Chi, TCM, Vitamin Therapy, Yoga, Sujok, Auricular Therapy, Hydrotherapy, Rife Therapy, Visualization, Reiki, Magnet Therapy.

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app helps healthcare providers quickly evaluate a patient's personal and family history to determine whether a genetics referral and/or testing is warranted. For quick reference, the app is organized by cancer type. For instance, if your patient has colon cancer (or a family history), the colorectal guidelines indicate the age cutoffs and significant family history features that warrant a genetics evaluation. The guidelines are based on national and professional society criteria that are often referenced by genetics professionals and the health insurance industry. Did you know there are dozens of genes and hereditary cancer conditions to consider when assessing your patient? A family can have many different types of cancers, all linked to a single inherited cancer gene. For example, your patient may have a personal history of prostate cancer, and a family history of breast or pancreatic cancer (as seen in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome). The app is designed to guide your questions as you discuss your patient’s family history. You will be able to determine if your patient meets referral criteria for HBOC syndrome, or another cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is available. Referral guidelines by cancer site: breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, blood (hematology), brain, endometrial, endocrine system, ovarian, skin, stomach, kidney (renal system), lung, and sarcomas. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app also provides quick links to information about labs and genetic testing options, local genetic counseling services, and web-based telegenetic services.

A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

I wish the \"get info\" about a folder would also show the number of files in that folder (and its subfolders) instead of just the size, but I guess one can't have everything. Best file manager I've found.",

        "description": "The patient's ability to tolerate surgery without significant morbidity is an important factor in triaging advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) patients for initial surgical management. Indeed, the clinician could use this information to personalize decisions regarding upfront surgical cytoreduction versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of our model is to develop and validate a simple adjusted laparoscopic score to predict major postoperative complications after primary debulking surgery (PDS) in AEOC.\r\nTo obtain a simple and easily applicable pre-operative score, the number of potential predictors\r\nwas a priori restricted to the parameters with the best performance (p < 0.2) at multivariate analysis. Overlapping factors were removed based on their strong correlation and subsequent overfitting risk. The study population was randomly divided in a “derivation group” (n = 370) representing two-thirds of overall patients, and in a “validation group” (n= 185). \r\nThe multivariate model to predict major complications was developed in the derivation group. The regression coefficients of the predictive parameters were shrunk by the calculated constant shrinkage factor (0.94) and then transformed the results into simple points. The mean risk for each point was calculated, and a scale to associate the predicted risk to each score was developed. Significant predictors included in the scoring system were: poor performance status, presence of ascites (N>500 cm3), CA125 serum level (N>1000 U/ml), and high laparoscopic tumor load (predictive index value, PIV≥8). The sum of each value for each variable made the overall predictive risk score, which ranged between 0 and 8. \r\nThen, the score and the predicted risk were computed for each patient in the validation population, and these new variables were tested using the c-statistic and the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. \r\nSince our model was developed and validated on the same data, the performance could be too optimistic. However, to correct for the optimism in discriminative ability, the steps taken into Cox regression were internally validated by 200 random bootstrap samples and a subsequent correction for optimism in the c-statistic was performed. Moreover, since the model reflects a continuum of risk assessment, women were equally categorized a priori into three different classes: high risk group for score between 6 and 8, intermediate risk group for score between 3 and 5, and low risk group for score between 0 and 2.\r\nThe prediction of risk of major complications using the score as progressive values is:\r\n2.2% for score 0\r\n3.5% for score 1\r\n5.4% for score 2\r\n8.4% for score 3\r\n12.7% for score 4\r\n18.7% for score 5\r\n26.7% for score 6\r\n36.7% for score 7\r\n47.9% for score 8\r\nThe mean risk of developing major postoperative complications was 3.7%, 13.2% and 37.1% for low risk group, intermediate risk group and high risk group, respectively. \r\nTo make more user-friendly this model, we have thought to develop an application for mobile devices. Indeed, despite the accuracy of internal validation by using a randomly selected 33% of the study cohort, a limitation of our model is the lack of validation in other centers and healthcare systems, which is a prerequisite for large-scale adoption of this score. In this context, although we acknowledge that laparoscopy is not adopted in many international centers, our results increase its indications and call for a larger use as valuable diagnostic tool in AEOC.

        "descriptionHTML": "The patient&#39;s ability to tolerate surgery without significant morbidity is an important factor in triaging advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) patients for initial surgical management. Indeed, the clinician could use this information to personalize decisions regarding upfront surgical cytoreduction versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of our model is to develop and validate a simple adjusted laparoscopic score to predict major postoperative complications after primary debulking surgery (PDS) in AEOC.<br>To obtain a simple and easily applicable pre-operative score, the number of potential predictors<br>was a priori restricted to the parameters with the best performance (p &lt; 0.2) at multivariate analysis. Overlapping factors were removed based on their strong correlation and subsequent overfitting risk. The study population was randomly divided in a “derivation group” (n = 370) representing two-thirds of overall patients, and in a “validation group” (n= 185). <br>The multivariate model to predict major complications was developed in the derivation group. The regression coefficients of the predictive parameters were shrunk by the calculated constant shrinkage factor (0.94) and then transformed the results into simple points. The mean risk for each point was calculated, and a scale to associate the predicted risk to each score was developed. Significant predictors included in the scoring system were: poor performance status, presence of ascites (N&gt;500 cm3), CA125 serum level (N&gt;1000 U/ml), and high laparoscopic tumor load (predictive index value, PIV≥8). The sum of each value for each variable made the overall predictive risk score, which ranged between 0 and 8. <br>Then, the score and the predicted risk were computed for each patient in the validation population, and these new variables were tested using the c-statistic and the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. <br>Since our model was developed and validated on the same data, the performance could be too optimistic. However, to correct for the optimism in discriminative ability, the steps taken into Cox regression were internally validated by 200 random bootstrap samples and a subsequent correction for optimism in the c-statistic was performed. Moreover, since the model reflects a continuum of risk assessment, women were equally categorized a priori into three different classes: high risk group for score between 6 and 8, intermediate risk group for score between 3 and 5, and low risk group for score between 0 and 2.<br>The prediction of risk of major complications using the score as progressive values is:<br>2.2% for score 0<br>3.5% for score 1<br>5.4% for score 2<br>8.4% for score 3<br>12.7% for score 4<br>18.7% for score 5<br>26.7% for score 6<br>36.7% for score 7<br>47.9% for score 8<br>The mean risk of developing major postoperative complications was 3.7%, 13.2% and 37.1% for low risk group, intermediate risk group and high risk group, respectively. <br>To make more user-friendly this model, we have thought to develop an application for mobile devices. Indeed, despite the accuracy of internal validation by using a randomly selected 33% of the study cohort, a limitation of our model is the lack of validation in other centers and healthcare systems, which is a prerequisite for large-scale adoption of this score. In this context, although we acknowledge that laparoscopy is not adopted in many international centers, our results increase its indications and call for a larger use as valuable diagnostic tool in AEOC. Moreover, this application for mobile devices increase its reproducibility.  <br>Lastly, through this app, the surgeon may accurately and easily predict a patient&#39;s postoperative outcome with an early identification of high-risk woman, thus adopting tailored strategies on individual basis.<br>* Vizzielli G, et al.

The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",

Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",

            "Edit 5/10/2020: This used to be such a beautiful app, always used it in place of the regular Telegram. Downgrading the rating for two reasons 1. It hasn't been updated since May 2020 and 2. It still hasn't received the Video Calling update that the regular app has had for two months. What gives? I thought this version was supposed to receive newer updates sooner.",
            "It's great! But when i uninstalled and reinstalled, it seems to not work on my mobile data anymore. All my other messaging apps still work so the problem isn't with me. I've tried all the solutions on Google, like clearing cache, but no use. It only seems to work on wifi which is such a shame. Is there a way to fix this issue? Has anyone else encountered this too?",
            "Definitely lightweight and hogs way less resources in background compared to the official app and it's forks like Plus Messenger. Faster? maybe, the animations in TGX are slick but overall it's the same speed as official app. All I want to see is this app getting updates atleast once in 2 weeks to keep up with new telegram features, then it'll be perfect!",
            "This app is a very general and decent one to use for chatting to people anywhere in the world. The calls are typically much clearer than Discord, and I love the fact you can send videos of any size, unlike Discord. The reason it only gets a 3 star is because there's no option to delete/block contacts on the mobile version of the app. It's a hinderance to need to get onto a computer to remove a contact you don't want.",
            "It is very good app for sharing bigger file. At first it downloaded the file properly. But now it's not downloading.... It's a big problem. It's very difficult because I 've to reinstall and install every time so please rectify this problem. If it can't download any file and it seems very useless. So please rectify this problem as soon."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",

Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",

It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. 😡",

            "I had AVG years ago. Had issues. Installed AVG Free a month ago. So impressed after a month, I bought the upgrade version. WOW! What a difference a clean machine makes! TY ! BobG in AZ",
            "Love this!! Can clean out caches, hibernate files etc. without accidentally getting rid of files I don't want to lose, all with a push of a couple of buttons. No more painstaking searches through each and every file to find more memory space each time I get low or my speed bogs down. I use this at least once a day if not more. Can't beat the price--FREE!!!",
            "I've tried using this 3 times with an uninstall in between. Last time was directly after a factory reset. Each time the app just makes all open apps flash on and off as well as my screen to come on after locking my phone with the power button. Seriously not a good performing app. Did it do what it was supposed to do? I think so when everything stopped flashing. But nothing that my OS tools already don't do for free. Am using Android 10 on an LG V40 ThinQ.",
            "I am impressed. Easy to use and you can take care of your device for all your devices in one app! Adding the AVG Antvirus is a great plus especially when you have the Ultimate subscription. The anti virus is always looking out for your device in real time keeping it safe. The VPN also a fantastic feature! Thamk you AVG for looking out for me.",
            "It's working good so far. I've only installed it today and subscribed to premium. It's been doing a lot of work for me, so I haven't had a chance to learn to navigate the app. That's one of my bigger things I look for, navigation ease and understanding its terms and language. So far, I don't understand a lot of what the app is asking me to do but I put my trust in it because it's AVG. I've always liked AVG"

            "It was a great app. I had a few different tunings purchased. But now I am unable to restore my purchases. Even the guide on their website that shows how to restore them does not work. -edit- After working with support I have my purchases restored. They ended up having to give me a promo code to restore them. Everything is working great again. I use this to help tune my 2 guitars, bass, and ukelele.",
            "Easy to use. I have a terrible ear so this really helps me stay in tune.",
            "I've used this for a few months now, and it worked just fine until about 3 days ago. It wouldn't listen to me playing any of the strings, even though it was on auto mode. I left a review saying what had happened, and the developer of the app got back in touch within the hour. They asked for me to delete the app, restart my phone, and them reinstall the app. I did so, and all problems are gone. It's back to being the great app it was before, so I'm happy.",
            "It actually tuned my guitar!!! also has loads of fun interactive games that help you learn/master chords",
            "Honestly this app is amazing no ads and pretty on point with tuning your guitar. Also have had no problems so far, and you don't even need to pay for the tuning part. Really recommend this for someone who is just starting out on playing guitar and wants to learn how to tune your guitar. Definitely 5 star! :)"

            "Highlighting Oct update-now on 10/26 STILL no joy daily bonus; giving up. Was a fun game, but w/ game set on silent & DND on, ads can blare out (ads never muted even when game is. :-( Update 6/9: Still volume issue. Getting more frustrating than fun. Update 10/15: daily bonus fails - check in same time every day - never get to day 7 award any longer. On top of incessant ads to just play, this is going on my 'only if I'm desperate & totally bored' pile. A real shame it has deteriorated to this.",
            "Can't put it down. In a week I am over level 600. Not getting any work done. Good game for waiting for someone, keeps you busy. Minimum ad's, good controls. One of the best\"bubble\" games I have played.",
            "MINUS ONE STAR!! Super KAK as the Ads take longer to play than to clear a lever and there is a damn add aver every lever. And some adds make your phone glitch so you have to exit the game and then restart again. Not worth it. And the higher the levels go the longer the adds get. STAY AWAY.. FAR FAR AWAY",
            "Good game, but the bonus round for getting more coins is almost impossible to win! Too few bubbles! I was a champion pattern gamer in my younger years, so I know these games well.",
            "So far I have been able to complete the levels with no stress. Other games would be so hard you had to do the level over and over...hope that doesn't happen with this one. So far...so good 👍"

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "I use this every single day. It's helped me achieve a much healthier and balanced lifestyle. I use it mainly for the calorie tracker. However, the estimation for calorie expenditure is nuts. I'm a 30yo male, 5'8\", 230lbs, wanting to \"lose weight fast\" was given a target goal of 2500 calories per day. This is to lose weight \"fast\". Not maintain it. Do not use the feature in the app/website. Best do a quick calculation over at any google search you find for \"TDEE\" total daily energy expenditure",
            "Makes it so easy to be aware of our daily calorie intake, and also the cumulated nutritional values (!) of the food we eat during the day. Possibility to make custom recipes which will then be counted and added to the meals according to portion size. Seriously, this app is awesome! So simple, but so great ..it can save you a ton of time if you're just starting out to eat consciously.",
            "This app is very useful for keeping track of calories consumed throughout the day with its food journal. The foods are searchable by brand, variety, etcetera. The app is able to calculate how many calories one needs to consume to lose, gain, or maintain body weight according to current weight, weight loss goal, and activity level. I have seen results on the scale by using this app as a tool to help reach my goal.",
            "Great app. I first downloaded MyfitnessPal app and it was a hard app to get used to and was riddled in ads and asking you to sign up to premium. I then found this one and I was used to it within a day of using it. Its very easy to operate. Only thing is, I find it doesn't recognize alot of barcodes and food you type in.",
            "Works very well. Easy to use once u get the hang of it. I only wish it could track some other things like BP and take pill reminders. The people behind this have been very responsive with help and questions. I reccomend using this if you want to get a good evaluation of you food habits with the caveot....ya gotta be honestbwith you entries. 'Nuff sed."

            "As an original Kickstart backer in 2017, I have always been pleased with my purchase, until this last update. I can't begin to tell you how upsetting it is to go to your digital fence option to pull up history that's always been there until now. All the sudden, without warning, my history is limited and I'm supposed to pay a premium to access my data that was already there? Shameful..don't let greed get to your head. You'll lose customers. Sure hope this gets enough attention from the community.",
            "They introduced a premium subscription plan. This was not part of the deal. Deal was buy the fing box and you get all the software and features that come with it. Now they are finding ways to nickel and dime us and to keep us as paying customers. Every company does this. Offer an idea, back them up, you pay for the device and then the company now has millions of people with their device in their house. Then comes the hidden repeat business plan. Hate companies like this.",
            "This app used to be clean and simple, but now it gets more and more cluttered with each update. I used to use it exclusively, but now its so cluttered with \"features\" that it is almost impossible to find the features you need. It's so sad when a good app gets ruined like this, more features does not make an app better!!! It can if it's carefully designed but fing has totally failed in that regard. I have decided to move on and I am now using a different app that's more like Fing used to be.",
            "I've been using the fing app for a long time now and I really love it. I liked it so much that I bought a fingbox when they were still looking for funding on indiegogo. After updating the app today, I am disgusted to see that the developers have the audacity to offer \"premium\" features for a subscription. This action leaves a bitter taste in my mouth as this is how the developers treat the very people who enabled them to bring the fingbox to the market.",
            "Since Google doesn't provide enough characters for a thorough review of Fing, I'll just WARN anyone considering this app to look elsewhere. If history is any indication of what can be expected, then you need to know that paying a monthly subscription fee won't be any assurance that you'll get what you're paying for very long. And if competent Tech Support is important to you, then you definitely need to look elsewhere, because if you have a legitimate issue they can't fix, you will be ignored!"

And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "Thanks Brothers, I love JW app 💗💗💗 However, recently I am experiencing an issue with it and I am wondering if you would be able to help me please. It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet 🤗💖",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "Kind of ok at the beginning, you can level up fast, progress quick, and upgrade your gear easy, in the beginning that is, after a while everything hard to the point where you can't progress at all. That wouldn't be a problem normally, you just have to git gud right? Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",

I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",

            "I actually played this since last year. I was happy when the update released but my only request is to bring back the old shield in spearton. It was cool but after the before update, the shield was circle and round. It kinda looked bad for me in my opinion so I just want the old one back. But overall, The game is so good and I love the game modes and levels. I hope soon there will be a new troop called the jet force which it will only defend only the base. I just wanted a flying troop. 😊",
            "I have been playing this game, since you copied the stick war game in Y8 and also since when I was 7 years old, but I still love this game, I know every possible way to defeat every levels without thousands of gems, the other players don't understand what they're playing, because they don't know strategy. So my request is I need 6 lines on my men, not 4, like in the stick war in Y8, I need more men to line in 6 lines, that is only my request, I need 6 lines in a formation.",
            "Its a game that is addicting you leave you think your done with it .....but your not. You just keep seeing it and endup downloading and undownloading again and again untill u just leave it installed to play when ever you wont. One of the game s I have left on and countiue to have in ever new phone I get. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is cause its to addicting.",
            "I love this game. I love how you can play as each individual character, it doesnt make the game feel like an idle game. It would be great if you guys can add more characters which then means you add more campaigns. Id suggest adding a flying character, horsemen, samurais and etc. I like the theme of the game where it sticks to historical and non fiction characters. All in all, great game. Keep it up 👍",
            "The campaign is okay. The tournament & weekly missions are VERY P2W. You can use flawless tactics & the enemy is designed to come with such overwhelming force that after normal mode, if you don't spend thousands of currency to win... You're CRUSHED with impunity. It would be a decent game otherwise. Good for 10 hours of play time. Move along quick."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",
            "It be happy to assist you with your background closure ,extended battery, help finding your loss of your product, phone 📱 or any other product you have been working on with anti theft protection 😉 😀",
            "This app is great with helping to clean files and monitoring apps using up your battery and/or memory. I have only had them for about a week now."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

Then when you go to use gold bars, if then boots you out. There is still the mini game from lock down too on there that if you push the wrong button, freezes the app and you have to come out and restart again. It's not lack of memory as when I tried it on the tablet I have the same issue...",
            "it is addicting and lots of fun to play. Never gets old! It gets more challenging the higher you go in the levels. Im nearly to leel 500 and its still fun. has gotten really strategic now in levels 500 and above. Now at level 720, it has become much more difficult and at times can be not so much fun but I seem to stick with it to keep going to higher levels. I will find myself on the same level for a while and then suddenly get it and that keeps me interested. I am in level 958 now",
            "I love this game. The only thing that makes me mad at it is the fact the the fairies are dumb af. I mean instead of helping they just don't... how many times have I lost a level cause there are 3 bubbles, one of them is going to fall, but the fairy still chooses that one... other than that yes. I love the game.",
            "Love it! Been playing over 2 years, lol... and I'm on level 2,433! It's very addicting. I love playing it when I'm bored and in my breaks at work. I also like how they change things up and the bonus levels! Keep up the good work!",
            "Immediately unplayable for me. Every shot makes the screen briefly flash and shake. No idea why games want to alienate anyone with motion sickness, migraines, seizure risk, etc. No reason why you can't have a nice looking game without the constant movement, flashing, sparkling, shaking the screen."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",

I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

            "I've used Phonto for some time now and I can say that it is a fantastic little app for adding text to images. It's easy to use and remarkably powerful. Apart from changing size, position, font and colour, it even allows you to curve text, add a background and make it see-through. The ads are not intrusive. I've even used it for professional design work. With so many apps out there, you often don't know what to download. This one is a genuinely good product; I can fully recommend it.",
            "This app is personally great, i use it to make personal pins for pintrest. Just to give young teens advice. This app was perfect for adding words on top of pictures, and creating edits. But recently, the updated the app. I haven't been on it in probably a month so i decided to go back on. And it's impossible to save your projects. I had to take a screen shot n crop it on picsart. When before, you could just download it straight to you files. This app needs to be re-updated, But it's great still.",
            "I have been having some problems with this app. Don't get me wrong is great to use in many ways. But my problem is that I have some issues when iam trying to add a phont to my text it always kicks me out of the app and usually says that the app is not qor kiti ing correctly or something. Wich is why iam giving it a 3 stars. Idk why it does this, but I dont think this happens to everybody. But PLEASE PLEASE fix this!I haven't been able to use it for a while!!",
            "For the past 4 or 5 years, I've been using this app for my text-on-photo uses and it's been fine UP UNTIL THE LATEST UPDATE, where I can no longer save an image after I'm done. The save option isn't working no matter how many times you press it. Also, the display has gone completely whack after the latest update; I use a chromebook so I know it still shows up in the smartphone format, but the display was completely fine & functional before & I could see everything UNTIL NOW. Please fix this!!",
            "Sucks compared to iOS options. I found this app because of a YouTube tutorial. The options that it showed were great for what I needed it for. I paid for this app to discover that it is seriously lacking compared to what I saw. I even looked on my iPad and the options there still weren't what I needed. It will suffice for somethings for the $2 I paid. All I need are better shape options.. You would think that the app would be about the same across platforms."

            "The game is quiet fun, but my first impression of the game was that it was slow. Within the first hour of playing, I got bored. An \"optional\" increase in speed (×2) could be good. People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

I exited and re-entered the app to find the review already posted. The notifications I received were incorrect. I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",
            "Yelp just cost me $75 in overages on my data plan because it's CONSTANTLY running in the background! It sucked 5.5 GB in one day! Apparently my phone settings were reset during an update, but this should NEVER have happened! Why do you need that much data from me?!",

            "Uninstalled. I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

Your looking for a shell gas station then they put a station 3 times farther then you wanted as the 1 search! You drive past 3 stations to get to their 1 search results!

            "You should also add an option where users can sell their unused equipments to add in their funds so that it won't turn into waste after upgrading. And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "This game is filled with ads every few seconds, which is understandable to a point, it's free, but those ads should be appropriate for the target audience of the game. Multiple ads have come up that advertise the keto diet and explain that if you don't go on it your partner will hate you, or that your appearance is the only thing that matters. Others advertise animated characters and zoom in inappropriately on their crotch. This is unacceptable for a children's game!",
            "Angela is adorable! She has cute fashion sense and I've always thought this game is full of good vibes. The mini games are also pretty fun! Just a heads up, there's a lot of ads in this game, but I'm glad the more inappropriate ones don't appear anymore for the sake of its intended audience. To the devs: Minor note as if writing this, her hair in her Halloween outfit sometimes glitches in her sleep.",
            "Great but there's a few glitches. Like the puzzle game. Blocks get stuck at the top half of the screen and you can't move them. The sky high game - you can't get higher that 10 points even if you got all perfects/ even if you watched an ad to keep going. Makeup that you (in game) buy gets removed if you dance with the blue stars and earn temporary makeup. After a day, Once the temporary makeup ends, the other makeup gets removed even if you didn't use the temporary makeup. Pls fix ♥️",
            "This game is very good,relaxable,enjoyable and many good things about this game I love this game so much ,,,but Can you please fix the bugs. When l go to store to buy sticker for watch ad (data off) and when l turn on the data it will show that 20 diamonds. I RECOMMOND THE INSTALLERS THAT PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS FOR ENJOY, EXICTMENT, RELAX AND FEEL GOOD",
            "This game is very good there is one problem reason for 4 stars. Every time I went out and went back in then it kept on saying go to the previous game or start a new game then every time I went to the previous game it made me start everything overeverything like the sleeping and they're eating and applying and the dancing went to 0%"

            "It isnt much, but it gives exactly what is promised, which is all you need. The controls can be a bit finicky at times, but it isnt too bad honestly. The game plays ads any time you enter or exit a picture, as well as certain pictures that are locked behind ads, but unless you only do the really small and simple pictures then it really is nowhere near as annoying as it sounds. Overall, it's a good time waster and definitely worth having on your device.",
            "I use this game to relax myself when I'm angry or sad its so much fun to play I like pixal art games and also I can put my own photos to color in its so much fun!!!!!There are so many pictures to color in! I recomend this game to people who need to calm down. I love fnaf alot so thats what I put for my picture and its so calming to play. Happy halloween!!",
            "I love this game, it's relaxing but it's not very relaxing when it keeps freezing everytime I try to do something. Try to color a new picture and it freezes, go to my works and it freezes. I also am wondering why the rockets stopped? They were really, really helpful when it came to bombs and wands, they should be brought back as well.",
            "super fun game :D my favorite feature is that we get to turn our photos into works of art! it's difficult at first because some have like 70+ colors but its a really calming game (except when you cant find that last missing square of color.. grrr!) would definitely recommend if you're looking for a game to pass time! i also have this game on my iPad so it is available for iOS too! everything is fine except the controls, i keep pressing the back button when im trying to color :<",
            "Ads, ads and more ads. Ads to unlock a picture, okay that's fair enough. Then ads whilst you are doing the picture. What happens when you have completed a picture? Yep, you guessed it....more ads. I did look at removing ads, it's not a one off payment but a subscription service. £43 per year or £12 per PER MONTH or £4.99 PER WEEK to remove adverts, considering Amazon prime costs me £5 per month and Netflix £8 per month then I'm really struggling to see the value, it's ridiculous really."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Great game! A good time piece for lockdown. However... the new update rolled out today and I am on of the 1 in 5 males who suffer from colour blindness. The new darker colour scheme does not work for me. Will it stop me from playing? Probably not, though the previous version was better suited to my disability. It would be good if the developers could look at winding it back. Naturally there are a few bugs in the new version also, namely trying to play another game. It freezes on my Samsung S10",
            "Really good for the CS fans. Few bugs, about the final tally and lag in the game. Rest, still online game, it feels like AI or computer or bots playing the game. Difficulty level can be increased. Secondly, making squad and playing with friends is the issue.. We have to restart game after every match.. New update, people are hacking it easily.. They are not dying to head shots also.. Nevertheless grt game.. ❤️❤️",
            "Latest update is really bad. It has lot many bugs. Please fix all the bugs soon or Revert your code changes to previous version that was really good and stable. It is not allowing all the players to be in the game. Sometimes only 2 or 3 including CT and T. And sometimes only one player. LOL. How can we play with ourself.",
            "You have ruined the game after new upgrade.. listing down few problems.. - It's taking too much time to join the lobby and teams r not balanced after joining and sometimes no one else is joining. This is most serious problem. U hv ruined it. - Players r joining in mid of the game. - CT has also bomb after team flip..lol - No option to exit the game after joining the lobby. Many issues with UI",
            "Additive game. Critical Review: 1.sometimes don't starts properly saying network issue, despite network is perfectly ok. 2. Latest oct. Fancy UI upgrade made the game slow. Kindly make sure I was using ultra high quality video in previous version and game was working perfectly. In the recent version even high quality lags. 3. Games works at medium quality but it's very irritating for eyes. Feature Request: Add live voice intrection with others if possible."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

            "Literally, BLOWN AWAY!!! I have never experienced a game like this. Deer Hunter is so basic about hunting in such a beautifully detailed environment. And the Events are just amazing! Every single thing in the game makes it more special to play everyday. It stands apart from the crowd of other hunting games and expresses itself in such a beautiful way. The graphics are totally awesome, the mechanics are convenient and the Western music keeps my enthusiasm up! Just change D.H 2018 to 2019. Thanks.",
            "I love the game but can we get more energy like one every minute and why I love it the hunting is great and the dogs are good but can we get more heat in the suits, and more chum, bait, and fishing energy please make the wepons cheaper oh and it takes a while to load but I think that it is worth it please make these improvements.",
            "It's a fun game, I highly reccomend getting it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I get logged out of the game whenever I try a mission in a different region. The main problems for me is the loading screen, it's so long, I have to wait like, 3 minutes to be able to play the game. I don't really mind the ads, they aren't very annoying, and the game's scenery is kinda cool to look at. Overall, it's pretty great, it's my go-to game to install whenever I get a new mobile device.",
            "Great game to be honest. I love hunting the animals and it gives me a surreal experience of hunting. But as soon as you hop online to competitive shooting things take a turn for the worst, people can't compensate at getting better so what do they do? They hack, ever since I got into cts it's been hacker after hacker scoring near impossible scores like 30000, 70000, 50000 etc please fix this, make a program that bans all hackers as soon as a hack is detected and never let those goons get away.",
            "It's an awesome game. It's like real hunting just on the go!!! Its a really fun game, nothing to complain. ITS AWESOME!!! Its still awesome in 2020!!! 5 star city!!! Huntsman101 level 7 region 2 in about 15 min"

I should be able to delete my stuff. It is my stuff to delete if I want to. Played both versions and it is not so friendly to f2p. I mean I thought it to be a real RTS but not nearly close.",
            "Too many potty mouth kids INSULTING each other and PLAYERS without any reaction from developers on report. Stopped playing, uninstalled. It's basically like any other PAY game. The more MONEY you spend, the more you can HARASS others. Not the most elaborate strategic war games I've seen but its ok. Gets a little boring with all the waiting around. Horny sounding and looking animated girls narrate the game progress. Whatever floats one's boat...",
            "It's a good game. But still needs some adjustments. Like, it unecessarily cuts my 1500 game golds in the name of HQ transportation, when I tried to transport it to a nearest place of my guild member. After deducting the above amount, it simply says it cannot be done due to some kind of boundries. I mean, which type of game is this when I am unable to help my team members, couldn't arrange a rally or be a part of it? Seriously, a lot more work is required to improve this game.",
            "Great, attack heads could be improved, it's hard to pull the troop from the crowd and then you get annoyed.",
            "This is Kiss of War with Zombies. That's it. As far as I can tell, there are very minor differences, such as you can't choose the United Kingdom, Helena isn't available in the beginning, and Pandora is now Chimera (though a lot of the spoken dialogue still references Pandora). Really lazy re-skin, but that music makes all of the difference. Stick with KoW is you've put any significant time in it, otherwise play this for the awesome music. Oh, and zombies!"

            "Man, this game is one of the better free games on the Google Play Store! I remember when I was younger I'd play this game and from then to now the game feels a lot more polished and in my opinion is better then most games you have to pay for on the app store. It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",
            "New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",
            "Oh no!!what happend!!! All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

            "I have to say the graphics are really good, but sometimes, the ref gives a foul or yellow card when it is clearly not a foul. But the quality is good and in multiplayer, although it lags, it has exciting gameplay. I was and I am still critical because you have removed DLS 19, but this sort of wins it back. Pl focus on the improvements and add DLS 19 ( if possible)",
            "Easily could've gotten 5 star with the gameplay itself. But ads every half time is terrible. I do watch ads to get extra coins so no need to put it at the half time. Also the cost for stadium is too expensive. You really expect the player to score 10 goals every game? Can't improve the squad and have to watch ads after every game just for the stadium upgrade bullcrap. That's just plain stupid.",
            "So many things to improve. 1. The analog joystick. When my players make a long shot, the ball still move towards the goalkeeper even when I move the joystick to the top corner of the goal. 2. The goalkeeper's reaction doesn't make sense. Even the GK from PES still can be defeated at short range, unlike the GK in DLS 20. 3. The goalkeeper still error. You can review that game again. I don't know how to explain it ~_~",
            "Out of all of the football games I have played, the controls and smooth gameplay that DLS offers is far better than the competition. PES and Fifa struggle to create such a unique and lag free experience, but every year DLS improves their already superior controls. DLS is in no way a pay to win game like Fifa and is a very enjoyable game. Everything about it is a 10/10 from me.",
            "I love this game and wanted to give 5* but damn! Some things really piss me off. 1. Why don't we have control over how we upgrade our players anymore? 2. Why don't we have the options to sell our players for money 🤦 Now the multiplayer experience is getting worse. It will disconnect even if there's strong network connection. And the other person wins. And your team's fitness drops.... Too bad"

I can't even leave playing because this game is so fun!.....There are some things you should add such as a cap or mabe if you can ride your pets, play with them, bild houses for them and can put cloths on them! A have been reading some reviews, most people want cars and malls, yes I agree with them.But I want a boat and maby a joy land so we can have rides!!!

            "This is a very nice game. Like other games there not are too many ads. Best game ever in my life. Just a suggestion that put more of mystery boxes so it could be mysterious. Thanks. Love this game. The workers who made this are the best. Keep the great work you all are doing. Thanks and one more suggestion that keep more minigames in the arcade hub like swimming.,racing etc etc so there will be more fun in the game of pkxd. Thanks",
            "Hello, I'm sorry if I'm saying like this..actually I'm a loyal fan of PKXD games but, when the latest PKXD update came out, I felt something unsatisfactory because, when I pressed the button to play..it kind of started to lost control. I think there is a bit of annoyance with this but I just hope this PKXD Team can be ready to help and repair the damage. Thank you! My PKXD account is actually (CarleneTimeYT #223)",
            "Hey! I absolutely love this game I have ever played! Although I do want to mention some things I would like you to add to the game. I think that PKXD is amazing but I would like to have more to do maybe add a new mini games in the arcade, also new pets would be great not legendary but some suggestions are, lions, tigers, monkeys, pandas, brown bears, polar bears, and buunies. Another thing I would love for you to add is a camera that the pictures get saved to your smartphone. :)"

Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",

I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "This game is amazing. I love the fact that you can play offline. And there's only a few ads so it makes the game even more amazing. and the fact that if you level up you can get more op guns to kill the ppl who spend like 3000 bucks on this game. i havent spent a dollar on this game and i can beat people. so for all those haters, just keep trying!",
            "A good fps shooter with a lot of game modes and guns. It also has a new update every month which often includes new guns maps and even new game modes. The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

        "description": "Glioma. Tumor ini tumbuh pada jaringan glia (jaringan yang mengikat sel saraf dan serat) dan saraf tulang belakang. Sebagian besar kasus tumor otak yang terjadi adalah jenis glioma.\r\nMeningioma. Tumor ini tumbuh pada selaput yang melindungi otak dan saraf tulang belakang. Sebagian besar dari tumor ini tidak bersifat kanker.Hemangioblastoma. Tumor ini tumbuh pada pembuluh darah otak. Kondisi ini bisa menyebabkan lumpuh sebagian dan kejang-kejang.Neuroma akustik. Tumor ini tumbuh pada saraf akustik (saraf yang berfungsi untuk membantu mengendalikan keseimbangan dan pendengaran).Adenoma pituitari. Tumor ini tumbuh pada kelenjar pituitary (kelenjar kecil yang terletak di bawah otak). Sebagian besar tumor ini bersifat jinak, namun bisa memengaruhi hormon pituitary dengan efek ke seluruh tubuh.\r\n\r\nKraniofaringioma. Tumor yang kebanyakan dialami oleh anak-anak dan remaja ini tumbuh di dekat dasar otak. Walau jarang terjadi, tumor ini dapat mempengaruhi kelenjar pituitary dalam otak yang berfungsi melepaskan hormon pada tubuh, hingga struktur otak lainnya.Medulloblastoma. Ini adalah jenis tumor yang bersifat kanker dan kebanyakan dialami oleh anak-anak. Tumor ini tumbuh dari bagian bawah di belakang otak dan cenderung menyebar hingga ke cairan saraf tulang belakang.\r\n\r\nTumor neuroektodermal primitif (PNETs). Ini adalah jenis tumor langka bersifat kanker. Tumor jenis ini bisa tumbuh di bagian otak mana saja dan berawal dari sel janin otak.\r\n\r\nTumor sel germinal. Tumor jenis ini biasanya berkembang di masa kanak-kanak ketika testikel atau ovarium mulai terbentuk. Tumor ini kadang-kadang bisa berpindah ke bagian tubuh lain, seperti otak.\r\n\r\nSelain jenis-jenis tumor di atas, terdapat juga tumor yang terdiri dari gabungan beberapa jenis tumor, atau gabungan tumor dengan berbeda tingkatan. Penanganan yang dilakukan sangat bergantung pada keganasan tumor, lokasi tumor, serta kondisi kesehatan Anda.\r\n\r\nLaman ini khusus membahas tentang tumor otak (jinak) stadium 1 dan 2. Silakan membaca kanker otak untuk tahu lebih banyak tentang tumor otak ganas.\r\nGejala Tumor Otak\r\n\r\nGejala tumor otak sangat berbeda-beda antara satu dengan lainnya. Gejala yang muncul dipengaruhi oleh ukuran, kecepatan pertumbuhan, dan lokasi tumor. Tumor yang tumbuh secara perlahan-lahan mungkin awalnya tidak menimbulkan gejala apa pun. Setelah beberapa lama, tumor akan memberi tekanan pada otak yang menyebabkan munculnya gejala, seperti kejang-kejang dan sakit kepala. Tumor otak yang berada pada lokasi tertentu dapat mengganggu sistem kerja otak sehingga tidak berfungsi dengan benar.\r\nPenyebab Tumor Otak\r\n\r\nHingga kini penyebab utama dari sebagian besar kasus tumor otak jinak masih belum diketahui. Terdapat beberapa faktor yang bisa meningkatkan risiko seseorang terkena tumor otak. Faktor keturunan dan juga efek samping prosedur radioterapi adalah dua di antaranya.\r\nPengobatan Tumor Otak\r\n\r\nDiagnosis dan pengobatan yang dilakukan sejak dini akan mempermudah penanganan pada tumor otak. Apabila tidak segera ditangani, kondisi ini bisa menjadi bertambah serius. Tumor otak biasanya tidak menyebar dan hanya diam di satu tempat saja. Meskipun begitu, tumor otak bisa memberikan tekanan dan merusak area di sekitarnya. Pengobatan yang dilakukan bergantung pada jenis, ukuran, dan lokasi tumor.",

Tumor ini tumbuh pada saraf akustik (saraf yang berfungsi untuk membantu mengendalikan keseimbangan dan pendengaran).Adenoma pituitari. Tumor ini tumbuh pada kelenjar pituitary (kelenjar kecil yang terletak di bawah otak). Sebagian besar tumor ini bersifat jinak, namun bisa memengaruhi hormon pituitary dengan efek ke seluruh tubuh.<br><br>Kraniofaringioma. Tumor yang kebanyakan dialami oleh anak-anak dan remaja ini tumbuh di dekat dasar otak. Walau jarang terjadi, tumor ini dapat mempengaruhi kelenjar pituitary dalam otak yang berfungsi melepaskan hormon pada tubuh, hingga struktur otak lainnya.Medulloblastoma. Ini adalah jenis tumor yang bersifat kanker dan kebanyakan dialami oleh anak-anak. Tumor ini tumbuh dari bagian bawah di belakang otak dan cenderung menyebar hingga ke cairan saraf tulang belakang.<br><br>Tumor neuroektodermal primitif (PNETs). Ini adalah jenis tumor langka bersifat kanker. Tumor jenis ini bisa tumbuh di bagian otak mana saja dan berawal dari sel janin otak.<br><br>Tumor sel germinal. Tumor jenis ini biasanya berkembang di masa kanak-kanak ketika testikel atau ovarium mulai terbentuk. Tumor ini kadang-kadang bisa berpindah ke bagian tubuh lain, seperti otak.<br><br>Selain jenis-jenis tumor di atas, terdapat juga tumor yang terdiri dari gabungan beberapa jenis tumor, atau gabungan tumor dengan berbeda tingkatan. Penanganan yang dilakukan sangat bergantung pada keganasan tumor, lokasi tumor, serta kondisi kesehatan Anda.<br><br>Laman ini khusus membahas tentang tumor otak (jinak) stadium 1 dan 2. Silakan membaca kanker otak untuk tahu lebih banyak tentang tumor otak ganas.<br>Gejala Tumor Otak<br><br>Gejala tumor otak sangat berbeda-beda antara satu dengan lainnya. Gejala yang muncul dipengaruhi oleh ukuran, kecepatan pertumbuhan, dan lokasi tumor. Tumor yang tumbuh secara perlahan-lahan mungkin awalnya tidak menimbulkan gejala apa pun. Setelah beberapa lama, tumor akan memberi tekanan pada otak yang menyebabkan munculnya gejala, seperti kejang-kejang dan sakit kepala. Tumor otak yang berada pada lokasi tertentu dapat mengganggu sistem kerja otak sehingga tidak berfungsi dengan benar.<br>Penyebab Tumor Otak<br><br>Hingga kini penyebab utama dari sebagian besar kasus tumor otak jinak masih belum diketahui. Terdapat beberapa faktor yang bisa meningkatkan risiko seseorang terkena tumor otak. Faktor keturunan dan juga efek samping prosedur radioterapi adalah dua di antaranya.<br>Pengobatan Tumor Otak<br><br>Diagnosis dan pengobatan yang dilakukan sejak dini akan mempermudah penanganan pada tumor otak. Apabila tidak segera ditangani, kondisi ini bisa menjadi bertambah serius. Tumor otak biasanya tidak menyebar dan hanya diam di satu tempat saja. Meskipun begitu, tumor otak bisa memberikan tekanan dan merusak area di sekitarnya. Pengobatan yang dilakukan bergantung pada jenis, ukuran, dan lokasi tumor.",

I have played it and love it but most of the time events are based only on shopping like buying ship in discount or something other. You don't need to bring any events like this. Also all those things can be bring within shopping section. So please thinks about it once. Thank you.",
            "Good fun game at some point. BUT...... microtrasaction are out of this world. 50 bucks for a 30 days subscription and so on. if you want to be competitive and don't mind spending hundreds of dollars, you can play this. Ps. you can get some stuff for free, but you are going to spend hours watching ads. Example to get a free ship you have to watch over 40 mins of ads to unlock it.",

After the latest update several of my ships and side guns can no longer be selected. Inworked really hard to get the money and gems and what not for those ships and upgrades. What happened to take them away? I would give 5 stars because i love the game that much. But taking all my ships? My wakanda ship? Wth? Edit: Fixed within a day!!",
            "I absolutely love this game, I play it 24/7, But I'm confused as to Why all of a sudden it's not allowing me to play due to a pop up saying, TimeOut!!!!, May someone please tell me what is wrong, I brought in over 30 friends to download this game an they don't see it but me..They are all wanting to delete it like myself may I please have an explanation as to why it's saying this ONLY on the partners section only🤔🤔🤔🤔"

            "Water plots takes too long to get. You can only get ropes, anchors, and hooks from trailor park Nick. He mostly gives you ropes. So I gave up on that. Also it takes 8 hours to get one freaking shovel !! Also the pad locks, shovels, and nails should not be included in the barn items. They take up too much room. If you can't sell it then it shouldn't be in there. Store it somewhere else.",
            "I have played this game for a long time. I can't tell if you are trying to get players or loose players. Every event, animal add on, and ect; you ask for 6 or more of the same thing, constantly repeating, everything requesting the same material to finish the product. The problem has got so bad you are loosing players because they can't get ahead or finish anything and no help from co-op, they're in the same boat. Please understand you are loosing players not gaining players.",
            "This was a great game until, it started freezing, before this whenever I started the game it used to freeze for 5 sec and the game ran properly thereafter. But now it keeps on freezing many a times. And even I updated the game thinking that, this was happening cuz I didn't update for a long time, but I was wrong. I don't know why this is happening, otherwise I loved playing this game, particularly.",
            "It would have had a higher rate but since the wild animal farm showed up i can't play my game, it freezes in one spot and I have tried Uninstalling it and reloading the game, i have tried to contact support and it won't let me get through to support. I am not happy and in the past I loved playing this game. PLEASE FIX or i will no longer play the game.",
            "Game play is slow, difficult to water plants and feed livestock, the button doesn't respond or work. I've already submitted a report but it has not been addressed or fixed yet. This game has a lot of bugs that makes playing such a chore and taking the fun out of it. What happened to you guys? Update: Two updates were added 10/09/20. Only lasted a full minute before returning to its slow-mo pace. Can you recommend another alternate game, until you get your stuff together? Just saying..🤷"

            "Bed wars...kind of fun game but I only have one problem from the game. The joystick, when I always walk on the bridge (The one with wool that players can buy from game) it always go to the right side of my joystick!!! So I fall down when the joystick let me go to the right. Please fix this bug!!!!",
            "Ok so I got this a few days ago and have already seen hackers and people braking the game. Although it's a very fun game and you will have alot of fun playing. It would be better if it had the creatures or ender pearls(preferably both). And make to where it's one of those games where its you die in the first 3 Minutes of the game. If you fix some or all of these issues I will raise my rating. Other than that I enjoy this game very much so. It is worth downloading.",
            "Sometimes I wonder why this game is still up. I can't even count how many people I see hacking, breaking the game, and more clown moves. And the game producers have done nothing to fix it. So it is really annoying playing the game. But I can't stop beneath all the stuff I listed it is a really adictive game which is why I didnt give one star. But if these things dont get fixed I would rather play something else.",
            "I love this game!!!! it's soo fun..in the real Minecraft bedwars the swords,fireball and more cost ALOT of iron ,gold , diamonds and emeralds and it's harder to PvP so this game is better!!! please make more game's I love this too much!! I hope everyone is doing well and happy in carona virus (covid 19). 🙂🙂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🤍",
            "I only tell honest reviews. This is mine for this game: This game is probably one of the best games for android outside of Minecraft for blocky graphics. It has a very Minecrafty feel to it and I really enjoy playing this. Congrats to the developers. It has every basic weapon that ordinary BedWars has and then some. I also enjoy that everything works like it does is real deal Minecraft. Definitely a good pick."

            "Been a loyal user for many years and now the app has gone downhill, can't make collages anymore - I go to add pics to begin the process and it just hangs from there and never loads. I'm even paying this, worked better when it was free 🙄",
            "Not good. Too many glitches. Too many bugs I think. Keep stopping in the middle while doing work. Very unstable. I'm afraid not worth for money if buy premium. Reconsider my purchase. Try to look to other app which more stable",
            "This used to be my go-to editor until it switched to a subscription model. Now it only sometimes let's me even use the software, insisting I be online... even when I am in fact online. Searching for a replacement app now. Edit: Dropping from 2 stars to one... the devloper responded with \"make sure you have a good network connection.\" I'm three feet from a router connected to a fiber optic network connection, I am very very very connected to the internet. This is not my issue, this is yours.",
            "I used this app for years. I get it, people got to make money to survive and using an ad model is pointless these days. Yet, I personally think it would have been nice to have a warning about moving to a subscription model. Maybe like the popup that occurs now that blocks me from any edits, a popup for a month prior that said, \"Hey, we appreciate you but times are tough and in a month's time we will be moving to a subscription model.\" Instead, suddenly I cannot use the app.",
            "Honestly used to use pixlr all the time, not even thinking about the possibility it would lower the quality of the image. Recently however, I have looked closer and realized it makes every photo extremely pixilated! I'm not sure if this is a recent thing, or a thing I somehow missed, but it's extremely disappointing from an otherwise great photo editing app."

            "Game's good and all. Haven't played it in a while and now they've expanded it by putting Felix Kjellberg's home country. Which is Sweden in it as Region 65. More guns as well. Like to experience more guns. But thing is. Make it to the point where I don't have to wait till I'm in my early 50's to play. Everywhere I go it's a damn turtle to get to. Thank you!",
            "AWESOME,been playing on and off for about 3years or so, it's a never miss,always great hunts and hidden area's,,,only recommendation I would ask of developer's is to put more hunts in each section to get you the silver,gold, and red coins to be able to get the weapons for each hidden area hunts,,I think all would be ok with more type of hunts in each sections of unique animal's,to get to the hidden area's hunts,in those sections there are awesome animal's to go for,great game,🇸🇯",
            "Meh. Graphics are ok. Controls are a bit erratic. Some of the levels are designed to make you spend energy. Would give at least one more star if the reload button could be moved a bit. It's almost on top of the fire button. So, sometimes you reload instead of shoot. Costs you more energy. That you pay for. Videos for useful stuff are unavailable. But, videos for other things are available. Tiny bit of a money grab. Unless you are extremely patient and like playing for 15 minutes at a time.",
            "Overall an enjoyable game where we can watch videos to gain gold to advance in the game. However..after a couple of weeks the video stopped...so I cant collect gold anymore... Is this your way of forcing players to spend money to buy the gold coz without it its impossible to advance... Gonna wait a few days and see ...if still no video...sayonara to the game....",
            "Awesome. But, what algorithm is the game development company using to ensure that the prices we have to pay as consumers, is worth the gameplay we get for the dollar amount you're forcing ? In other words, prices need to desperately be discussed as a team. Not the best \"bang for your buck\"."

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "There is no doubt that the Muslim Pro App is a fantastic application and it is the best of its type. I consult it every day as it is very useful to me in communicating with my Creator. May Allah reward the Developers adequately, Aameen. However I wish to inform you that whenever an update is received, downloaded and installed on the Muslim Pro App, all information on the Birthday section on the Calendar is wiped out. Please what can be done to keep the information intact.",
            "Very good app, however i preferred the previous version's method of marking verses as read. Now I have to click the three dots to mark each verse as read and to save progress. Very tedious for each verse. Edit: They have not changed the Quran system and did not even respond to my email regarding this issue. Very unprofessional and arrogant.",
            "My lifetime premium version had worked very well so far but today It does not work at all on my huawei P30 Pro. Last android update. Please help. In addition, app on huawei app gallery canot be upgraded to premium version.. I will re-rate once I fixed. .................................................. Updated on 21 October 2020, it is working good right now.",
            "Alhamdulillah The Muslim Pro app is always reliable, and accurate. It is an excellent reminder to read the Qur'an, and have inspiration. Also there are plenty of ways within the app to connect to the community and now with the virtual Hajj journey it is a blessing. It also helps me with being on time, having the Adhan play for the obligatory prayers. Signing up for the lifetime membership is a sure way to always be connected.",

            "Nothing really works, unless it's a function that entails you giving them money. Never an issue, there! But, the biggest turn off for me is the PvP arena. There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "Nice way to relax. It does have a LOT of ads, but when you consider just how much free stuff you get (4-8 new pictures each day), it balances out. Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

            "I'm ok with apps that require money but don't advertise as a free one with purchases when from some level and forward you make it impossible to pass it without buying some extras (or wait until a following day to retry)",
            "Had this for less than 5mins, then uninstalled. Ads, ads, ads!! and you cant even get out of them, you are forced to sit thru the whole thing every time. Only had a very short little go at playing, and that wasnt all that either. There's dozens of bubble shooters much better than this, ones where you actually get to play the game too instead of sitting thru ad after long, boring ad!!",
            "I have been playing this for a long time and loving it. Now I can't get into it. All I get now is a black screen. I've been through all settings trying to fix it. It's been like this for about 2 weeks. I've also uninstalled and re installed at least 3 times with no luck. Help. After reading reviews, it looks like others are having the same problem"

            "You really need to put in less instrumental songs and more songs with words. Most of these songs are like fast paced lullaby songs. Need more songs that have a good beat, are English, and have words in the songs. Also a few more songs that start off a bit slower for beginners.",
            "This game is just horrible. It's slow, it's lags, the adds are constant, I had to play airplane mode and it still lagged. The music gets drowned out by the vibrations and the app overall is just ugly. I'm not sure what happened here but it's honestly not worth the time and energy to even download.",
            "*sigh* I have to take a quick break from this game because it's so addictive! But the only problem I have is about the amount of ads shown literally whenever you do ANYTHING! It's getting irritating. Please do something to shorten the amount of ads. Please please please! I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

And says outlandish number of seconds until the game starts like 2868 seconds until the game starts and then all sudden I'm starting to game and then it kicks me out when there is 20 bingos left and says game over and then kicked me out saying that there's a data error",
            "*Update: 10-7-20 I haven't played for a while and I have no clue how to turn on Epic or whatever, but I also just lost 60 tickets! I bought 1 card in Candy Crush and accidentally hit the back button, even before the game had started and went straight back in and it took my tickets and didn't even give me my card!! Smh! * Love the game but there's only like 18 bingos per 180 cards. Need more bingos and I'll give u 5 stars! It's no fun when u rarely win a bingo!",
            "Great, fun game; BUT do not be fooled, this company is out to rip you off. The stupid bucks are so hard to get, rewards take ages and dollars, and even the farm town part is totally a rip-off. On top of that, they don't allow you to watch vids for things. I understand charging for lots of extras, but then your money doesn't even go anywhere.. these are fake items on a phone ppl are purchasing.",
            "How about fixing your technical issues! Have not been able to send and receive gifts for a week! Cannot open new locations, too! Fix it!!!! Still not fixed; can't even open Tasks now. You suck! I have logged in and out of FB numerous times, still not fixed! I uninstalled and re-installed this game 3 times; still cannot open gift box, today's Tasks , and now the icon has disappeared where you can do the daily and royal challenge, WTH!!!!! You need to fix your ridiculous technical issues!!!#",

I was trying to select the number of cards to play and it me to the mystery purchase page, meanwhile the balls were being called and would not let get on the page to play.....this happened THREE times. ...,.I'd select the number of cards to play and the mystery purchase page comes up....over and over!!

I logged in with the Google play account today but can't load the previous progress , I also checked the Google play account it still shows I made some 14 achievements.",

The game is overrun with cheaters who stand outside the maps and kill everyone. Turrets still fire through walls. Every other game is filled with players who stand still but you can't shoot them but they shoot you. This game is unplayable and the european staff responsible should be fired. Scum, just scum.",

            "I'm awake! Just thought I would try this game, man, I hope you try so you can feel what I feel right now. Excitement is all around you, the enemy is too, get the rusty ole rifle and pick a spot, the action is swift and the ship is moving. Try this game and you will be moving too! Or ? Get moving sniper, lock & load!",
            "After level 400 it's almost impossible to continue except you spent a lot of money for Dia to remove the unrealistic wind effect every time. Upgrades like guns, bullets and so on are not more than a kind of a placebo. Try yourself and compare it by playing a minigame using different stuff. I have fired more than 50k real bullets up to distances of 300 meters in my life and even in hard wind. I never experienced such a wind effect, not a 2 ms and not at 4 ms not even with a muzzle loader rifle.",
            "Ads galore!! When will the mobile gaming market move out of this sleazy, cheap practice of freemium games, and move onto the next era like with demos, then buy the game of you like it? No darn ads... UDATE: Spent coin on an upgrade, then next time I went in, the upgrade was not available. It was like I never bought it! And I lost all that coin too! No way would I put real money into this game."

Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

Everything else in the app works perfectly. Please get this fixed. Originally I rated this app 5 stars years ago. The last few months I have not been able to get to my Roku TV expert picture settings. The app crashes every time I select expert picture settings. There is no other way to get to these settings other than through this app.",
            "Super useful! I love the fact that you can use your phone to listen privately. A couple of small peeves: 1. When I close out of the app, it still seems to run in the background sometimes. It shows up in the drop-down notification bar. (This is just an OCD thing.) 2. I'm not sure if it's my phone or headphones, but the private listening will occasionally cut out and then disconnect. It's usually easy to get reconnected, though. Overall, I'm satisfied with this Roku app!",
            "I have LOVED this app until recently. Now, the shows I try to watch decide to randomly skip 5 minutes ahead or stop all together... You call it bug fixes, I call it bug infestations. What happened to the great streaming I previously had? I have plenty of data, not to mention the fact that I'm mostly connected to a business internet router. Previously, I would have given 5 stars, but now? I'm not even convinced it deserves one.",
            "Amended: I added a star because I was finally able to connect the app to my device. It's pretty responsive, but the problem I'm having now is that when I use private listening, the sound will cut in and out. That makes watching things really difficult. Original review: app is useless to me. I've tried a dozen times to get this app to connect to my device. Won't connect no matter how many times I reset or redownload or restart my device and my internet. It's a hot mess 🙄",
            "New controls are awful. Half the time it selects when it should move or move when it should select. Swiping to move makes it move more than one space. It's like they thought it would be cool to have this new feature, but didn't think to ask end users. Also, it disconnects from the device the moment my screen turns off, which means it must be exited out and reopened before it will work."

            "It's absolutely amazing! I love everything about it. But the update was a little unfair so I suggest to use the 1.9 apk version. Because that's the original. But the update really keeps users from using some inappropriate things. But it also keeps clean users from doing some casual stuff like crawling or sitting down. But all in all I love the app. I suggest it 100%",
            "Its an amazing app but there is a little bug that most users are experiencing... If you edit/make your character and then leave the game for a while, half your progress will be lost! I've tried to ignore this bug for a long time but its starting to get on my nerves... please fix this problem. thank you! Apart from that, this app is very fun and extremely customizable",
            "Although I do love it, it could use some improvements. I really want the colors, poses, ECT back plis. I don't have gacha club, and I might get it. On the tablet, its really good. Except for when I try to get out. When I try to get out of the app, it gets me into \"Life,\" and to be honest, its really annoying. But you can't fix that Luni, so thats just a me problem. I'm giving u a four. Be thankful its not a 0 or a 1. (Plis don't ban we for saying that 🤭)",
            "The best game EVER. If you want to create a life and make your own characters then this is the right game for you. And you can also make a YouTube channel with this game. You make anything come true in this game. If you want a YouTube channel and you dont want to show you face, get this game. Also this can be your get away like me. I highly recommend this game! Then the community started making R rating things and then the unpate happened and some of it was unnecessary,but it's still really fun!",
            "It's amazing, it broke once, but it's working good again. :) My only complaints are that the animations are slow and glitchy.. Could you please try to make them smoother and faster? Also, if I make a spelling mistake, and try to fix it, it just goes gibberish. When I type on anything else, it doesnt do that. I think the auto correct is broken or something. Besides those 2 problems, this is an amazing game, I absolutely love it! 👍🏻😍😄😁"

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",

            "It was a good game but way to many ads and I thought that it should have be a shorter time interval between doing each step so I would not recommend unless you like long time intervals between each step and ads spamming all the time I would play it again if it did not give me the only option of watching an ad 😡😡😡😡",
            "Love this game. But I thought when we updated it there would be more free recipes, levels higher than 10 & just new things to do in general.",
            "Now one can play OFFLINE! YES! that's a big plus. You still need to go online to download recipes and other stuff but you can play offline now and you guys added so much activities to the game. You can fish, you can cook, sell, grow fruits, own a restaurant, etc.. it worth it now. Thank you so much.",
            "I like the game. Ive been playing it for about a day or two, the ads are fine (i mean you have to make money some how) the only thing I don't like is the farm, shop, ect have a time limit and if you pass that time limit, you can't play for the rest of the day. I think thats kinda stupid i don't understand why its like that",
            "I LOVE this game! It's not just \"cooking,\" but has various other activities for you to compete to run a restaurant; like fishing, harvesting an orchard and garden, and running your restaurant. The game helps me to zone out and relax, and the slight Japanese theme running through out reminds me of my time spent in Japan ♡. Anyone at any age can play. I wouldn't waste your time buying any in app purchases though, don't really need them to enjoy this app."

            "challenging & interesting game. Certain levels are too challenging for the simple minded like me! Tempted to give up many times as it's too time consuming! 😢Don't understand why the gold bars are not available for use even though the piggy bank has been full many times. Getting too difficult to complete a level, impossible in fact for hours on end. Very tempted to give up all together & try other games. Getting to a stage where it's too time consuming to complete a level. Losing interest.",
            "This game is fun sometimes, until you have one left and you lose. This game is rigged. Cause they can give you what you need if there is only one left, but they want you to spend money, and when you do spend a little money, you would expect to get cheaper prizes and better prizes. Y'all need to do something about it because im getting annoyed when that happens after I've spent $30 or $40, im expecting better results with my spending",
            "Been Playing for 10 years and I'm obsessed with this game. I love the animals and the challenges, I have gotten all of the animals in the game w/o really putting 5$ in and playing on/off for so many years. So Its a great game with great side games you can play for hours. To the Developers I would like to see more of the level streak boost. For every level you pass you get boosters on your next like the candy crush sagas have. Thank You if you made it here!",
            "Great game until you reach the pay wall level. Move the sheep to the hay.. yeah when the game decides that you're allowed to. No information provided on how to move the sheep, thought I'd got the last sheep to the hay with my last move but NOOOO.. game decides that the same move I'd made with the previous sheep was not allowed. 100% designed like this so you spend money. Well not me. Deleted. As with candy crush take your game and SHOVE IT!!!!",
            "fun till it started cheating😡When it starts cheating again I will uninstall it again. It is ok for awhile then it cheats. Funny that the cheating starts when a player reaches higher levels. I am not going to pay for gold bars I have \"WON.\" A lot of time is wasted on ads and other nonsense. I spend mote time watching dumb ads than playing...boo!"

            "Great Game, Ridiculous Pricing! I downloaded Paint By Numbers recently and found that I really enjoyed it. They make painting these fun, there's a rewards system and achievements. I liked it so much that I decided to buy it... that is until I saw the pricing. $5 a WEEK!! Or the option for $70 EVERY YEAR! No thanks. Game is great, but pricing model killed it.",
            "Hi, I really really love this game the best, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because when i went today to check my library which is were I finished the pictures, the pictures won't show colored they would show blank and I tried to color them back but when I left the app and came back all my pictures that I painted are blank again! So please fix it then I will enjoy it and give a five star overall I recommend this game its so relaxing and its addictive omg I love this app.",
            "Very relaxing way to spend a few minutes. Pick your pictures right and they come out brilliantly. Only thing I had to change was the highlighter to a brighter one, couldn't see the grey one. Other than that it's great, and addictive, once you have done one and seen what it looks like you immediately want to do another. Finished ones can also be downloaded 👍",
            "Had to factory reset my phone and now all of my purchased gems are gone as well as completed pictures and purchased collections. No ok at all. Further to my review, ive contacted support numerous times to no avail. Ive done everything asked of me, provided sufficient answers to all questions and provided evidence. Ive been fobbed off and told \"we will look into it\" and \"we will fix this\" over and over but nothings been fixed. Either give me my gems back or refund my money. Con artists & thiefs!",
            "I really love this app. The pictures are super awesome! I can however only give 3 stars for now cause everytime I finish a picture it wants to play an ad(which is fine) if the ads worked. With the ads not working I can't move on to the next picture. If that was fixed I would give 5 stars no prob. But I can only do one picture and have to close the app. If you made it so I can continue even if the ads don't actually play I would also give 5 stars. Thanks for your time! Much love."

            "Game is very greedy, but fun. Stingy, but fun. Hard to become good. Cost a fortune or a lifetime to get a competitive player. Season pass is very stingy. 6 months of playing and you still will be average in stats. Game is very fun. But I spent $16 and have played for months and I have a long way to go. Game is fun but the creators are the greediest Ive evr seen. Could be one of the best ever, but your kids will learn what being Robbed feels like! Enjoy",
            "The game is entertaining sure.. but the controls are absolutely horrible! Half the time, it doesn't respond well, especially during the goalkeeing.. therefore losing the match.. fix this issue. Edit: Forget about what I said about it being entertaining! It's not!! How can it be when the whole game is rigged at higher levels..",
            "THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE! Do NOT get this game unless you want to be scammed out of coins you bought from your own money. I am barely on level 3 and im constantly going against players who are like level 20. Also whenever try to block a kick it keeps somehow going through my hands like im some kind of ghost. And, whenever i do the 400 coin game it charges me 500 COINS instead of 200! I do not reccomend this game.",
            "Addictive game but annoying as hell when you're put up against someone who's player has so much power in their shot it makes it nearly impossible to save. And when you play against someone on shooting race, sometimes your opponent resets for the next kick so much faster than you do (somehow) you cant win because they're 2 shots ahead of you!",
            "Paid $4.99 for VIP to 3rd Season Anniversary Cup yesterday. Game suddenly restarted in the final match. After restart, lost all VIP benefits. Later a Gold Cup was added to my account... Were is my VIP winner's green striped jersey and other winner's prizes? If you charge real money, test your product! The same issue happened before. That's why I didn't purchase anything extra for the game for a long time. Seems like nothing has changed on your side. That's sad."

I hope unlimited number of device protection is still available",
            "I'd give them ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ because the app itself generally works fine! But... there is a failure that irritates me a lot..! The MS App lock feature..! I understand that applications should be locked, if I want them to be locked. But come on... it is a bit too pesky when you have to unlock them every single time, over and over, even if they were minimised. Please, add a feature/possibility to make some apps stay unlocked in session. Thank you.",
            "I've tried the rest so I can say with experience that this is the BEST mobile security app on Google Play Store! Unlike the other apps their malicious website detection is superb. It actually detects suspicious sites before your browser can visit them & blocks you from even going there. Competitor's apps only detected 50% of malicious sites. VPN feature needs improved security & IP masking because the Plus hefty fee increase doesn't justify it.",
            "Can't access mcafee account after updating app and had no help from developer, except got redirected back to the app after which my code was regiven, only to be told by the app it wasn't valid and I payed for a year to be able to use the full app service, no other option to renew for another year was given either, what is the developer doing, give me the run around, so I give 1 star until problem is resolved. Thanks.",
            "This app is amazing. I brought a new laptop and I got a McAfee Multi Device Subscription for up to 3 devices. I loved this app because of its simple interface, real-time scanning and anti-theft. I can also backup my contacts and media in it. It improves my machine performance and provided me high security.

(Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",
            "10/10 my phone isn't the greatest and even with such high graphics and quality it is lag free. Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game. Used to play it a lot on my iPad a few years ago. I'm biased a bit cause of nostalgia lol.",
            "My experience with this company is misery, i personally have had over £40.00 in credits to which i have been passed from Google play store and the game builder time after time. I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",
            "It is a very good game, but the energy thing is pretty stupid, that and all the guns almost cost good and there is pretty much no way to get gold, other than that though great game! Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

            "My original review was 4 stars (for the free version), and I stand behind that. Then I decided to purchase the premium version a few weeks ago. I could not be happier with my choice of using Browsec as my VPN. It does exactly what it claims to do, and it does it very well. Just to give some sort of idea: I use Opera as my internet browser (has built-in VPN), and I still chose to get the Browsec extension to run over the Opera VPN. 5 Stars ✓ Thank you.",
            "Sorry for 2 star review but you befooled us into believing that it is free and unlimited. I just wanted to use United Kingdom VPN server but it only allowed 2 servers both if which aren't useful for me since I wanted to access the required location only. Add spoofing feature. The extension on Firefox doesn't work if you pin it to overflow menu as you can't see the extension box & settings. Highly slow for even online search or YouTube video browsing. Please improve chrome extension also. Thanks.",
            "Stuck in a hospital, got me right around all the filters imposed by the public open to anyone WIFI. While. Guaranteed to keep me private. Also increase in throughput is increased enough to stream movies. Highly Recommend it.",

I would like to have more characters. Maybe ones we made in hair salon can come here, like a linked game. Other than that it is funny and entertaining. Certainly you can download.

            "It's super nice. I like that you can opt for permanently delete files or put it in the recycle bin when you're not sure. It helps me (as an indecisive hoarder of the many photos I take) that I have to make a conscious decision to uncheck because the permanent delete option is by default. Already won back a lot of space. The analyzing and sorting is very insightful. Still testing but so far so very good !",
            "Out of all the file browsers I've tried so far this one's been the best. Copy pasting files are easy. And there's an option to either delete something permanently or not and also it reads most types of files and browsing through it is pretty easy. Not a fan of the recents tab where anyone who takes your phone can see what you've checked recently but appreciate the clear option.",
            "Only that i cant delete from app is why i cant give 5 stars! But it is great! The player plays almost anything, and moving of files is easy! It is quite the app. Sometimes and I don't know how I lose files. But if I just go to the recent files there she is! Works in Google drive, SD card or internal! Excellent!",
            "Awesome file manager. I have selected this app after extensive research. I have tried several cumbersome paid version file manager apps like \"ES File Explorer\", File Commander\" and \"Solid File Explorer\" but this one is exceptional because of its intuitive design. One should not compare of this app with the above mentioned crappy apps. This app is far better than other so called File Manager apps. Because of this reason I have paid for life time. I hope it would work as it described.Keep updating",
            "Great Storage Manager, Honestly I LOVE This One. Not Only Is It The Best Storage Manager, But It Can Open Files That You Probably Wouldn't Have Been Able To Open Normally. Also It Can Analyze You Storage's And Tell You EXACTLY What App Its From. This Is A Life Saver For Me Because For All The Apps That Leave Some Stuff On My Device, Now I Can Get Rid Of Those Pesky Folders That Eat Up All Of My Space! Kudos To The Developers, What An Amazing App They Have Here, It Just Extraordinary!"

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",

I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

You can use it via the &quot;⋮&quot; button at the top right of the Brush window.<br>- Added new filters: &quot;Waterdrop (Rounded)&quot;, &quot;Emboss&quot;, &quot;Chrome&quot;, &quot;QR Code&quot; and &quot;Find Edges&quot;.<br>&quot;QR Code&quot; is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.",
        "comments": [
            "Overall, I like this app. I just have a couple suggestions to make. -Add a trash feature, so that you still have some time to get a deleted picture back in case you accidentally delete something or change your mind. -Add a slider to the video playback. With really long videos, it's annoying to have to watch the entire thing through to get to certain parts, even with the fast-forward.",
            "This app is great! There's not that many ads, there's the right amount of tools to make wonderful drawings! It can be a little confusing at first but you'll soon get used to it! The only problem I have is, you have to have a membership to rearrange art order in your gallery?? I know they need to make some money somehow but... That just seems ridiculous and unnecessary, but other then that it's great!",
            "I need help, like when I was coloring the drawing that I just finished, suddenly it disappears, i was very scared of what just happened, i think I can redo it but I clicked on the redo button for like 1000 times it still doesn't give me back my drawing. I'm very anxious after what just happened. So can someone please help me out with this, please...😰😰😰😰",
            "This is byfar one of the best and very intuitive drawing app, I can work faster using Ibis compared to when I'm working with another drawing app. Stabilizer works great, doesn't stabilize too much, although I'd rather have the heavy stabilizer as optional because sometimes I need it too. Or at least there's more curved or flex ruler.",
            "I love this app and I would recommend but you have to be aware of lower battery and deleting this app. But there are so many cool things you can do. I use this all the time. It's easy, fun and free only, you have to watch an add before using all brushes. This is good quality and needs no WiFi."

            "The game is fun, but a lot of money is necessary in order to be competitive. Additionally, customer service is HORRIBLE! Because of glitches in the game, events are often dysfunctional. And even when screenshots are provided, customer service denies everything and never satisfies the customer. Additionally, when the desert oasis was \"upgraded\", I had bought a package that provided 10 additional territories, but I was only given five. I showed them multiple screenshots of their own ad, &.",
            "I have been part of the Lewz community since November 2016. There has always been a gap between money players and those just grafting for rewards. It was manageable and we had fun. However, over the last nine months the additions and changes to the game have been vast and heavily weighted towards big spenders. Not only that. Previous purchases and efforts are being devalued drastically, particularly in the desert oasis event, re gold coins. Only option: REPORT to Google Play!"

It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",

I like the new additions to AVG protection that are useful when using Andriod nowadays instead of Windows e.g. Ram Boost because it is easy to end up with lots of programs running in the background no longer needed but still open and using up RAM.",
            "I ordered the yearly subscription Ultimate edition and WONT show up in subscriptions when I log into website so it won't allow antitheft to be setup. VPN also won't allow itself to work. How am I supposed to know if anything else is working on here. I reached out to support and nothing. This is a waste of money. If I could give a lower score I would. Let's ee if I get help now",
            "Paid for subscription that renewed in June but when I open the app it stills says I need to upgrade to pro. Try to link it says no subscriptions found and yes I made sure it was the right Google play account. Stupid when my Google play specifically says I have a subscription but AVG protection app doesn't even acknowledge it. Waste of money, canceled the subscription.",
            "I don't usually install apps from other sites than Play Market, thus my chances to face viruses and prove if the app is reliable have not been high to this moment. Though, I used the PC version of AVG and it prevented some attacks. So, I think, it is effective. Still, there is an actual inconvenience: \"Web Shield\" stops working from time to time and user has to renew its permission to work in the settings of the mobile phone (Sony Xperia). P.S.: Thank you, I followed your advice.",
            "Generally happy with the app, but not happy with adverts popping up, when I am trying to select apps to hibernate. Some of these ads, spring up, with no obvious way of cancelling them, and can easily be activated, by accident. I am a pensioner, using the free version, as I cannot afford the de-luxe version"

Your backed into a corner.....stay away from it ! If your card is declined by their system your screwed unless you have another card There is no option to back out. Just use the normal app or website. This isn't phising...my account is banned cos my credit card isn't apparently supported by yourselves.!",

After your latest update all bugs have emerged. 1st of all im using your mobile app, everytime i enter a chat room and pick up a user to view, i have to always reload their cam and its inconvenient and very annoying. 2nd, the mic. I cant seem to mute it permanently if i want to, and the name of the dj (whoever they are) are reflected on the bottom screen of the app. That was very unpleasant to see and always annoying. Please fix the app asap i like using it. Thanks",

It's a very addicting site but yet they don't care about keeping their female safe!"

            "I've really hated this app from day 1, but I never complained since it kept me coming back, but now it's completely useless to me. I only use instagram to keep up with a few of my close friends and sometimes post some of my art. But now with recommended posts, my feed is filled with pictures that I just don't want to see. I can't use this app anymore, I was mad when they made it so posts weren't shown in chronological order, but now I'm livid. I've no more reason to keep using instagram.",
            "I have been using Instagram since like, last year. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. I have 2 accounts logged into the app, my finsta and my main. Since I use my finsta more, it's the one that's logged in whenever I update the app. But then I log into my main and the features are all the old ones? Fix this, or like add a feature where you update the app 1 time per account, and then I'll give this 5 stars.",
            "I been on Instagram since it was released for android. I always loved it,but the amounts of ads has become unbearable. Its ugly, noisy, intrusive and tacky. I'm hoping for better days. Edit 2020 oct And then the mute button didn't work anymore. Is it just for more \"never-ending content vibes\", is it a bug or is it pure evil? I don't even know anymore. When I scroll I can't keep going to my own follow list? Nonono, you gotta be tipped about more content, more accounts, It's never enough. Toxic.",
            "Over the last few days my posts have been getting arbitrarily flagged immediately after I post them, supposedly for breaking the Community Guidelines. I'm incredibly frustrated by this and there seems to be no way to stop this from happening. Same thing has happened to several other friends of mine. Whatever change was recently made to your automated flagging system needs to be undone immediately, as it is flagging accounts for no apparent reason.",
            "Not good for tablets. I am using a tablet. The stories are cropped from top and bottom. It's annoying. Scrolling in tablets is not continuous and smooth. The scrolling jumps to the next post below, I am not able to see the description of the post. Overall, this app has not been designed and tested for tablets. It is disappointing and, tbh, a company like Facebook should be able to handle a simple thing like variations in aspect ratios. I guess they don't have many tablet users so they don't care"

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

            "Great ,checkers, game. Best one I've ever installed on my Tablet. Just the adds, are to, long. 😞 ,Other then that it's really a great game, and the Graphics are so real, seems like you're really playing the game.👍, THANKS for very enjoyable ,game to play on my tablet. 🎮 👍🙋🎮 Love, the surprise!! 🎁🎁🎁🎉🎉 I strongly recommend this game to anyone that likes Checker's.",
            "I like this game - it's a good way to pass the time. But, when you have a chance to take a player, it makes you do that move (it doesn't give you the option to do any other move), even if it means you will get taken! If this was fixed it would be five stars. Edit: Thank your for your reply! I had no idea you could do that in the settings :)",
            "This is a fantastic game with a properly applied rules. You cannot beat backwards and kings can move only 1 adjacent square. There are no intrussive ads what today makes a huge difference among other so called games where the main point is to show as many ads as possible. 5 stars. Great!",
            "I tried this game. It is not that fun. It kind of made me mad.A lot of the times it makes you move checker and then I get jumped! It actually makes you lose by making you move certain checkers. For instance it makes you jump the other team and then the other team jumps two of you!😡 It has different levels easy, hard, and expert. I played expert and it was easy. Well for me. I do not know if i am just really good or what. I recommend not to play if you are even some what good.Get Roblox instead",
            "I sink far more time into this than I care to admit. Very polished draughts game which supports multiple rule sets despite what others have said (check the settings) I think the only thing missing that would make this perfect would be online play, but playing against the computer always provides a reasonable challenge"

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "I'm giving it 3 stars just because it is a very fun game and I play it fairly often. The lack of a 4th & 5th Star is simply because it is heavily geared (pun intended) towards pushing one to spend on IAP's. There are campaign zones, arena missions, PVP (this last is pointless once you get past the tutorial stage), and each zone or stage calls for certain weaponry, armor, perks, etc, which will cost you a lot of money as you upgrade equipment and buy better along the way. Fun game, but costly.",
            "I do like this game, nice and challenging at times and fun to play, but I think grenades should be added to the game. Do this and I'll give 5 star. (Update); Demoting to 2 star as I'm confused with lvl 27 on the third campaign map (Road Block Rumble) as I've seen a few vids on YouTube, it shows an armoured vehicle next to the guy on the left. But for some reason on my game, that vehicle is not there and is next to impossible to do. If this is a glitch, please fix and I'll give 5 star.",
            "It's amazing and I couldn't think of anything else it's challenging it makes you think it's like a puzzle every time and when you do his shooting part it sad that you're shooting other people lessingham the game is like you're saving a country and an existing secure in the army or you're a soldier saving its family or everything is just gonna be so much fun and it's really interesting when you play, and I just I love it so much! And it's just amazing So this thing's amazing!!!",
            "I have enjoyed this game greatly although there is a definite advantage to those who wish to spend a small fortune but it is what it is game on. I have not stated the game could not be played merely that there is a distinct advantage to those who wish to spend cash on the game. I do enjoy playing it just wish there were atleast some better options for obtaining premium weapons. Like completion of special levels to earn say a premium alien weapon or zombie weapon that would be more beneficial",
            "PVP is a waste. You play against the computer times I played. Developers will tell you otherwise, but they're lying. I quit playing it for the most part. No real sense playing when you're spotted as soon as you enter. You've no idea where they are, but they watch you for a few seconds then kill you. Or they'll disappear and appear elsewhere and get you. Better yet, you'll have one in your scope, he's looking down, as you're about to shoot, he looks up and shoots you. So the developers are lying."

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media player😟 Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

            "I love this game, but, they only allow you 12 free tickets every 40 minutes or so. It costs at least 4 tickets to play 4 cards in a round. So, this 12 tickets yet burned up pretty fast. And, who wants to stop playing and have to exit the game and wait 40 minutes for more tickets??? It's a hassle! So, when you run out of tickets, they offer in ad purchases to buy more tickets, and that's where they get you. I have not found a bingo game that is actually free to play. It's a shame!!!",
            "ADDICTED!!!!!! I wish you would put an option in to use our coins to be able to buy at least 10 tickets. I'm a poor 49 year old with a son who plays 2 sports a senior in high school and a daughter who just graduated college and needed a reliable car. So I gave her mine, since she's an elementary school teacher and needs to mold the minds of the future game designer's who will take your jobs in the future..... Damn sorry to ramble on, let me buy tickets with coins. Respectfully, A broke Dad. Lol",
            "Playing higher level now. Fun, but having fewer bingos, than when I had played for the first time. The reason I stopped this game, before, was cause I got tired of seeming to be forced to buy things to progress. I became angry an frustrated. Time will tell if I put up with this for long. Hate to stop. But I will. Their second chance will end. Will update.",
            "By far the best bingo game I've played! The tutorial when starting the game is very helpful. So many options for avatar and dauber. The voice call outs are different from room to room which makes it more entertaining. The leveling up rewards are great. Not interrupted with ads. Not required to spend money (available if you want to). Only drawback is that your account doesn't work on multiple devices.",
            "This is the only Bingo app I play. You don't have to use real money if you can't afford to. The graphics are neat and there's lots of 'rooms' to play. One of my favorite things is how all the callers sound different. Some times there are one or two callers that have a thick accent, but it's easy to watch the 'boards foe which number is called."

            "Why there is no glitch and ads",
            "So when I play the multiplayer game, the aponent's bar will run out and I will still have life but the game will continue on, until I end up losing!!??? Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "Hello, Twitch Team! Thank you so much for making this App. I really enjoy watching people play games like Among Us and MTG Arena. Lately though I've been having issue while watching a stream. Sometime it would just freeze and then I'll have to close the app and open it again just so I could resume watching the stream. I know it's not that much but sometimes I miss things in the stream. My phone is kinda old. Is it possible that my phone is at fault at this one? Thank you and bless you all!",
            "Trash app lol, certain games like CSGO are full of scam streamers, which they do nothing about, and sometimes they even ban the real streamer while the fake ones keep roaming with thousands of viewers scamming people. On top of that the sound just randomly starts breaking, it just becomes robotic from nowhere on PC only way to fix it is refreshing. On top of THAT on PC the stream will randomly freeze and u have to pause and reload to make it start playing again. The only way i could solve this was with an alternateplayer. Disgraceful realy, and these issues have been going on for over a year at least, i lost count. The only reason i still watch is coz all my favorite streamers are on the platform. Everything else about the platform except the emotes and the streamer communities is absolutely terrible. On TOP of that they are trying to implement ads in the middle of the streams, amazing to get an ad when an epic moment is about to happen :). Guess i should buy amazon prime in my country which would give me 0 benefit since they dont even ship here. Guess it's time to quit or see how it goes :)",
            "Its really good and simple to understand and use, but there's one big problem. Everytime I start watching a stream there's a 30 second ad, which is really annoying since you can't skip it either. If you could either ad a skip button or put shorter ads, like 5 second ads. If you could fix this, then I'll change my rating to 5 stars :)",
            "Good app - there are a few things that could be better but overall all, if you are used to using Twitch on the pc, you know what you are getting here. I have seen some people complaining about the lack of quality options and the presence of adverts but this depends who you are watching and the ads disappear if you are stubbed so don't worry about these points.",
            "I honestly love this app, it's a great way to communicate with your favourite streamers. But I have one problem. I want to change my username but I haven't verified my email yet. so I tried to numerous times but it keeps on saying something has gone wrong. I uninstalled the app and done everything I could but it said the same thing, and I was even putting in the right email address. Please fix this if you can!! Overall this app is great 👍"

Please do something about this.",

Also...at the time of relaxation, benefits of the upcoming exercise should be shown, that will be helpful for us ....thanq 🙏🙏",

            "Great App it works in the background and this appears to be done randomly. I say that because every so often I will get a report on my phone stating the number of Apps which are safe. Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

            "This would be a higher rating, except that there is no more save button. When I tried to save my finished page, it saved from only halfway done. Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",
            "Cant get abstract drawings. If hit to color they go to the timer & wont show at all. Cant get them back to color. This just started recently. thats why the rating is a 2. Other than that theyre a five.",
            "I love ❣️ the versatility of the options with this app. I can play with color schemes/combination: shading; changing the color selections and more. I'm intimidated by many coloring books with their details but I've found designs here that were similar that gives practice. I haven't found anything I don't like with this app ... as I learn more and more what it can do."

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

            "Was a great app, but when one purchases an app outright in full, then later is asked to now pay/subscribe to use half the tools suddenly is not okay at all. I never have & never will use subscription services. If you had the option to buy a new upgraded version each year, I'd be ok with that. But to pull a \"re-pay\" stunt like that for existing customers, leads me straight to the exit on this. I will no longer be recommending this app to the vast amount of others I work with unless changed.",
            "I paid for this app in full to get the premium mode a year or so ago. Now it's asking me to pay for a new version. Go and get f***Rd. I actually loved this app and was my absolute preferred app for editing photos. You had to ruin it and get greedy shame on you. And do not bother commenting saying why don't you try the free 7 day trial... You've lost me as a customer seeya",
            "This app is trash! It just crashed on me. I unintalled. The reason I bought this app was to animate some charachters in gacha. If you plan to do that as well I do not reccomend it! Its too complex to even know how/where to use the chroma key (if there even is one), and it crashes way to easily for me. 1 star for me. Experience wasn't the best at all.",
            "EDIT: One problem is that adding an image downgrades the quality of that image a lot. REST: Honestly I think I hit the jackpot downloading this app first as an editing app. It has literally everything you could ever ask for in a photoshop app. The scene option at the very end is pretty fun to mess around with also. You can pay for premium, but that just gives you a few extra effects, atleast I think. Which means this is probably the best free editing app you can get out there right now.",
            "I used to luv this app.But when i started my subscription, the app started crashing. My subscription will end Nov 2020.Cant save an edited photo..it just keeps crashing.it's good i just subscribed for a month or else ive wasted my subscription fee for a longer period."

Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",

It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ✔mark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

        "description": "In this Fertility Yoga Poses app, You can find effective Yoga Poses that Boost Fertility in Women to get Pregnant. Try these Yoga Poses for best results. Do write us a Feedback about the App.\r\n\r\n* The desire to become a mother is ingrained in most women. But what happens when this most basic biological function becomes a battle?\r\n* For many women, getting pregnant does not take a lot of effort. But if you happen to fall on the wrong side of statistics, you may experience one of the most heartbreaking conditions – infertility. The inability to become pregnant can leave a woman depressed and hopeless.\r\n* Whether you are just starting out on the journey of trying to conceive or if you have already walked the path of infertility, the one solution you can try is yoga.\r\n\r\nCauses For Infertility:\r\n\r\nThere are a number of factors that can cause infertility. The most common is the stress we go through everyday life. As it is already known and proven by research, stress acts a major hindrance in a person’s fertility. It is estimated that one in six couples face difficulties in conceiving. \r\n\r\nThe stress arises due to various responsibilities from career, home, partner and other commitments. Further, not having a baby after a long time can also be stressful. Stress affects our body so much that it creates various hormonal imbalances that result to different diseases.\r\n\r\nFertility Yoga – Why Is It Essential?\r\n\r\nNow here’s a million dollar question! How exactly does yoga work to boost fertility?\r\nNow, in no way are we implying that you forego medical treatment and depend just on yoga to beat infertility. But this ancient form of workout can be a great weapon in your arsenal.\r\n\r\nWhat Kinds Of Yoga Are Beneficial For Conception?\r\n\r\n* Yoga is all about how you do it and not how much.\r\n* Hatha yoga is considered to be very ideal for fertility as it involves slower and flowing movements.\r\n* The deep and slow breathing involved in this yoga calms your mind and allows for focus and concentration to set in.\r\n* The various holding poses called Asanas will help improve blood circulation as your mind reaches a state of peace.\r\n* While holding a certain pose, you have to imagine in your mind that a vital energy is flowing into your genital area.\r\n* These productive mind associations actually trigger the feeling of well-being and energy to the affected area.\r\n\r\nTips For Doing Yoga Poses For Fertility:\r\n\r\nYou need patience to practice Yoga and bring it to perfection. Along with Yoga asanas it is recommended to practice meditation, additionally. As Yoga asanas are exercises to the physical body, meditation is an exercise to mind. When both mind and body are balanced, body hormones will function well and then help maintain a healthy body. \r\n\r\nStudies have shown that mediation can literally change our brain cells. The negative thought pattern of infertility should be changed to ease the whole process. Ayurveda too is also proven beneficial along with Yoga. But first it is advised to practice Yoga alone for 3 to 4 months before taking any Ayurvedic medicines. Yoga will cure Infertility for sure but it takes time to get in alignment with nature. All the Best!",

The inability to become pregnant can leave a woman depressed and hopeless.<br>* Whether you are just starting out on the journey of trying to conceive or if you have already walked the path of infertility, the one solution you can try is yoga.<br><br>Causes For Infertility:<br><br>There are a number of factors that can cause infertility. The most common is the stress we go through everyday life. As it is already known and proven by research, stress acts a major hindrance in a person’s fertility. It is estimated that one in six couples face difficulties in conceiving. <br><br>The stress arises due to various responsibilities from career, home, partner and other commitments. Further, not having a baby after a long time can also be stressful. Stress affects our body so much that it creates various hormonal imbalances that result to different diseases.<br><br>Fertility Yoga – Why Is It Essential?<br><br>Now here’s a million dollar question! How exactly does yoga work to boost fertility?<br>Now, in no way are we implying that you forego medical treatment and depend just on yoga to beat infertility. But this ancient form of workout can be a great weapon in your arsenal.<br><br>What Kinds Of Yoga Are Beneficial For Conception?<br><br>* Yoga is all about how you do it and not how much.<br>* Hatha yoga is considered to be very ideal for fertility as it involves slower and flowing movements.<br>* The deep and slow breathing involved in this yoga calms your mind and allows for focus and concentration to set in.<br>* The various holding poses called Asanas will help improve blood circulation as your mind reaches a state of peace.<br>* While holding a certain pose, you have to imagine in your mind that a vital energy is flowing into your genital area.<br>* These productive mind associations actually trigger the feeling of well-being and energy to the affected area.<br><br>Tips For Doing Yoga Poses For Fertility:<br><br>You need patience to practice Yoga and bring it to perfection. Along with Yoga asanas it is recommended to practice meditation, additionally. As Yoga asanas are exercises to the physical body, meditation is an exercise to mind. When both mind and body are balanced, body hormones will function well and then help maintain a healthy body. <br><br>Studies have shown that mediation can literally change our brain cells. The negative thought pattern of infertility should be changed to ease the whole process. Ayurveda too is also proven beneficial along with Yoga. But first it is advised to practice Yoga alone for 3 to 4 months before taking any Ayurvedic medicines. Yoga will cure Infertility for sure but it takes time to get in alignment with nature. All the Best!",

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",
            "Some of the fonts in other apps have change to outline after using this spp. I like help but not unnecessary changes. It is hard to read outline words. Hope you can look into this matter. Will things be back to normal should I uninstall this app.",
            "I have always downloaded the CM Apps...Launcher, Security, Cleaner, Booster, Locker...etc Before I activate any new phone I make sure my CM Apps are in place. I have had very good results with the CM Guys and Gals and keep up the Fantastic Job !!! Colleen",
            "Terrible, terrible app. Unlock your phone and see an app. Unlock your phone to see the weather you never asked for. Whenever you plug it in to charge, it locks the phone. More of an inconvenience than useful"

            "I like this game but I don't understand why you have to watch adds to get some clothes. It's so annoying but other than that it's a great game. I like the way you don't get the same clothes for every girl. It's fun because you can use your imagination but I really wish you could move the people around. It's ok for kids but at the start they're all in bra's!! It's cool that you can start with any girl though. So it has a good side and a bad side",
            "Hooray, this update brings a much needed feature - saving your progress. Thanks, devs! This game is enjoyable. So many possible combinations, I've played for months, and still haven't created the same girl twice. Lots of categories - skirts, pants, shorts, long shirts, short shirts, jackets, scarves, jewellery, make-up, hair and more. Plus 4 skin tones for a realistic group of girls. The best dress-up game I've downloaded, definitely worth installing!",
            "This is good enough but my opinion is that you just change the yellow girl cuz she's not my favorite but thank you and she does not have good outfits you need to make more outfits for them and please don't make them extra fancy they all go she's my favorite but she needs more good clothes",
            "Game was okay but I did have a problem with a dressing it up so I could get there while you could only dress it up and you couldn't do anything with it so that's why I gave it to just start reading but I wouldn't really recommend you couldn't get it cuz it's kind of boring.",
            "This game is excellent, fabulous, fantastic, amazing, and interesting. I love this game. I suggest you to also try rhis game to those who will see my comment and I am sure you will also love it"

            "A goated VPN but some times I have to restart my phone before using the VPN because it doesn't connect say I opened the app I connect to the VPN and I turn it back off then in another time of the day it won't connect for some reason. I would give it a low rating but because it's a decent VPN and a free one ill give it the benefit if the doubt.",
            "This app does work and you dont have to pay for it. The only bad thing about this app is that random ads pop up on your home screen, apps and camera. I deleted it, but it is a good app for those who can deal with an ad pop up every 30 minutes.",
            "Only VPN I've tried that doesn't bombard you with excessive ads even when not in the app (surf vpn and those damn tik tok ads) and doesnt have a timeout limit. Update: Now throws ads at you after each and every click."

            "It works. Mostly. Not with a Bluetooth headset. Not with media keys. Sometimes, it does not display an interface to answer a call. Sometimes, the call ends by itself. Sometimes, the app reads it's offline, although other messengers work fine. Even with a locked screen, it displays the info about the last call that should be private. To say short, it's a popular garbage.",
            "New update made the app very slow all of a sudden. Not surprisingly, the reason was that ads have been added to the front page, amongst the chats, and throughout the settings. Viber now takes ~5+ seconds to load on my phone... I don't mind ads in general, but when they affect the functionality of the app itself, that should give pause to the developers. Disappointing really...",
            "App functions well in general. But i've experienced the following: 1. Wasn't able to back up my messages when I switched to a different device and the support was not really helpful. At one time, they took more than 12 hours to respond only to have them de-register my number, & I've been removed from all my group chats. 2. While I was in a call in mobile & switch to a different screen, I can't go back to the call screen. I was on mute during the call. Had to text my responses to the call."

But there is very small problem and that is ads , we cannot do anything about ads. Nowadays every app contain ads. To remove ads we have to pay money 😭😭😭. Overall this app is the best phone cleaner. I have one small request to remove ads from this app👍.",
            "I like the app, but when using it advertisement pop up and if my phone rings app will not release the screen so I can answer the call. I watch most of the adds but I don't like anything that takes o Dr my phone. This may cause me to delete app again!! Just checked something today,the app has a cach cleaner. After I cleaned cach with your app, I went and checked cach on each and every app on my phone and had to clear them myself!",
            "Good app. But the ads are pretty annoying and if you want to remove them you need to pay real money for it . Wish there was an app with no ads no more annoying things . But aleast it's a pretty cool app , it can boost your phone in a second if you're phone lags so much . It will junk all the useless stuff in your phone which makes the phone cleaner. I recommend you guys to download the app",
            "This app is the best it made my phone to stop hanging and now I can use my phone without the worry of it crashing 😉 I really hope they prosper and more apps that are better than this. That's my reason for giving it five stars 😁."

        "description": "First Trimester Pregnancy Back Pain: Causes and Treatments\r\n\r\n    - Causes\r\n    - Treatment\r\n\r\nFor many women, one of the biggest complaints during pregnancy is that aching back! Somewhere between half and three-quarters of all pregnant women will experience back pain.\r\n\r\nWhile it’s easy to pinpoint the cause of back pain in the later stages of your pregnancy (hint: blame the belly), what’s behind back pain in the first trimester? Here’s what to expect.\r\nCauses of back pain during early pregnancy\r\nEarly pregnancy\r\n\r\nThere are many contributors to the back pain you experience during pregnancy. For some women, it’s actually an early sign of pregnancy. If you’re experiencing back pain in the first trimester, there may be a few culprits.\r\nHormone increase\r\n\r\nDuring your pregnancy, your body releases hormones that help ligaments and joints in your pelvis to soften and loosen. This is important for the delivery of your baby, later in your pregnancy. But the hormones don’t just work in your pelvis. They move throughout your entire body, affecting all of your joints. In the first trimester of your pregnancy, this softening and loosening can directly impact your back. You’ll often feel this in the form of aches and pains.\r\nStress\r\n\r\nStress can be a contributor to back pain, whether or not you’re pregnant. Stress increases muscle pain and tightness, particularly in areas of weakness. If hormones are already wreaking havoc on your joints and ligaments, a little bit of anxiety about work, family, your pregnancy, or anything at all can go a long way to making your back hurt.\r\nSecond and third trimester\r\n\r\nAs your pregnancy progresses, other factors can come into play to aggravate that sore back.\r\nShifting center of gravity\r\n\r\nAs your belly gets bigger, your center of gravity creeps forward.

        "descriptionHTML": "First Trimester Pregnancy Back Pain: Causes and Treatments<br><br>    - Causes<br>    - Treatment<br><br>For many women, one of the biggest complaints during pregnancy is that aching back! Somewhere between half and three-quarters of all pregnant women will experience back pain.<br><br>While it’s easy to pinpoint the cause of back pain in the later stages of your pregnancy (hint: blame the belly), what’s behind back pain in the first trimester? Here’s what to expect.<br>Causes of back pain during early pregnancy<br>Early pregnancy<br><br>There are many contributors to the back pain you experience during pregnancy. For some women, it’s actually an early sign of pregnancy. If you’re experiencing back pain in the first trimester, there may be a few culprits.<br>Hormone increase<br><br>During your pregnancy, your body releases hormones that help ligaments and joints in your pelvis to soften and loosen. This is important for the delivery of your baby, later in your pregnancy. But the hormones don’t just work in your pelvis. They move throughout your entire body, affecting all of your joints. In the first trimester of your pregnancy, this softening and loosening can directly impact your back. You’ll often feel this in the form of aches and pains.<br>Stress<br><br>Stress can be a contributor to back pain, whether or not you’re pregnant. Stress increases muscle pain and tightness, particularly in areas of weakness. If hormones are already wreaking havoc on your joints and ligaments, a little bit of anxiety about work, family, your pregnancy, or anything at all can go a long way to making your back hurt.<br>Second and third trimester<br><br>As your pregnancy progresses, other factors can come into play to aggravate that sore back.<br>Shifting center of gravity<br><br>As your belly gets bigger, your center of gravity creeps forward. This can lead to changes in your posture that can affect how you sit, stand, move, and sleep. Bad posture, standing for too long, and bending over, can trigger or worsen back pain.<br>Weight gain<br><br>Your back must also support the growing weight of your baby, which can strain the muscles.

            "I keep getting \"Face undetected\". Usually before the update even if the face is undetected, there's a manual arrangement of eyes and lips but now there's none. Please get the manual feature back because sometimes it's just a matter of the photo's quality which causes a bit of a blurriness. I've been a loyal user of your apps since 2018, don't let me down now.",
            "All of a sudden this is saying \"face not detected\" and then forcing you out. There is a manuel way to select a face so I don't understand why it's doing that all of a sudden. Please fix!!! This used to be my fav editing app!",
            "App is sketchy, it opens randomly and keeps giving pop-up notifications that it's closing, even if I haven't opened it in months. It has access to things it shouldn't have access to. There are breaches in the app constantly which have stolen my passwords and debit card information right off my banking app.",
            "love this app but after the update the face will have spots its so noticeable even if i put filter fix this i already installed & uninstalled it twice but its just the same 😭",
            "As soon as I tap on the app, it says it isn't responding. I have Uninstalled, reinstalled and cleared the cache and data. Its been going on since yesterday. I will be switching to another app if this isn't fixed."

            "Game is really good. But it can be taken to the next level. Some things I would really love in the game are - 1. Multiplayer mode, 2. Net shots can be better. It shows ' Perfect ' and still hits the net, 3. Not able to defend the smash but the AI defends the smash, 4. Endurance sometimes doesn't work as it claims. 5. Body language can also be improved in each shot. Apart from these, the game is well made.",
            "This is probably one of the best Badminton game on the market. BUT, there's a huge issues that i need to address... FIRST OF, the \"Frozen Time\" special ability in the game is probably the most annoying part of it. Not only that this ability makes the game much more unrealistic (even though it's just a \"mini game\"), but also it makes the game to become imbalance. SECOND OF, when the player beginning to run out of stamina, then suddenly i couldn't even smash the ball while midair. FIX THIS PLEASE",
            "Guest login gives you a random name, can't change the name even though I have google games installed, no achievement or progress there. I don't use facebook there is no other option. The difficulty is not there at all, The AI is completely predictable after few levels. I reached ACE in a day, still no challenge. Apart from all this, I enjoy playing this game.",
            "I played this game ages ago because I was addicted to badminton and was so impressed by what I thought was an online badminton game. This turned out to be single player and i felt quite betrayed, however coming back to it knowing its single player with everything they've added has made me so happy, the shot selection options is so pleasing from someone who has played for many years and its good to see some variations from hit short, hit long, smash. With drive shots etc. The game is very fun.",
            "Yes I have played this game for 2months it was nice but it has some issues and they are 1. It doesn't support solo vs solo from large distances like a person from another city and another city. 2. Their must be some more controls like places and techniques 3. The abiltes are not too fair . If these were resolved I hope I may give 5 🌟 star to it"

I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",

            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",
            "Cost to much ti play i have been playing this game for years i spent alote of money on it and the change up to cyber we that were playing before that had to spend much more and the stuff we bought before we cant even use even the game packs have alote of stuff but there is 80%of it is stuff u cant use note that we should have renberse use for what we paid for and lost cause of the change up",
            "Game is good, but when you start you encounter bullying by way of dealing with continue killing of your troops. Get a good alliance an you can build up. For starters slow to building up but worth the challenge.",

            "I really like this editing app. It has lots of features and I have found it mostly easy to use. I have used other editing apps but always come back to this one. It would be a great feature in this app to be able to save, search, or favorite certain presets... like the preset texts. Overall, Great App. Good job. Plus, thanks for all the cool things available with this app for free.",
            "This app is really easy to use, and has a lot of options to choose from when editing photos from various filters, to effects. There are so many things to do with this app, even with the free version. The only issue I have is sometimes a picture will become pixelated however majority of the time, the outcome is great. Definitely my favorite photo editing app",
            "You can do alot of customisation and there are presets available for free which are enough to get you going, you can make realy nice edits with what's there you just need to get creative with it. and there aren't any ad pop-ups, insted they're on the side of your editor and don't get in the way of anything which is great. But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",
            "App keeps crashing I have been using this app for a long time now, have had problems in the past but now it keeps crashing as soon as it's opens. So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still keeps in crashing. I have purchased a LOT of effects, so I really need this to work. I gave 1 star because of this problem, if you can get this working for me I will upgrade the rating.",
            "Bestest ever... Amazing app with ennumber of filters & effects. I've been using it for 3 years now and I love it! my all time favorite app. Easy to use and very impressive and the great part is that its almost add free. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

It is a really good game I honestly think it's nice. And amazing and very good.if you like the games of the game don't think anymore just download it it's amazing you would love 😆😆",
            "The ads are really obnoxious, there isn't much to do either. There is little to nothing to do in this game. There is just so many ads they are way too easy for a child to click on. At least have ads that are children friendly, not geico!",
            "Paid for a no ads version, but all the ads keep showing up. I bought it to keep my granddaughter entertained during a long flight and it was just annoying having to be dealing with ads every few minutes since she didn't know how to get rid of them.",
            "Like so many reviewers, we paid to remove ads and they are still there. They went away after we paid, but after we closed and restarted game again, the ads came back and aren't going away. DON'T pay to remove ads - it's a scam.",
            "Its a very cute game but i wish they would add more things to do but it an amazing game and if the add are bothering people they should tern off inernet/wifi. Its a great game!😁😁😁"

I am not able to see the participants in a meeting. In short, not so user-friendly. Please fix this and update to previous version. The previous version was much better. Thank you.",
            "The former version of this was better. Ever since my google meet updated, it did not allowed to me join peacefully. It just kept saying either \"Failed to join the meeting\" or \"Cannot connect you to a video call\". It really irritates me, in a way that I'am the President of our class and it's very humilliating for me not to attend. I really HATE the new version. It works on my other relatives phone, but I don't have the chance to ask them to lend me their phone even 'cause they are using it.",
            "After the integration of meet and Gmail app, I can't adjust the volume of the meeting. Even if I click the volume button and move the level to mininum, it stays the same. Please fix this. Seems like this is happening to my specific device model. Edit: After the latest update, it's working fine. Still the 3 star to bring back the old UI.",
            "The recent update is worst!.. Trust me, I am not able to handle this new version of Google meet. I was struggling to find where the chat section was and from where to send messages. I have to zoom each and every thing presented on the screen. The screen looks too small. Once you go in the chat section,you are not able to see the screen. The old version is way better than the new version. Please bring back the old version. Please!",
            "The latest version is the worst and it's a shame considering the app was already great. Typing a message is very frustrating with all the names entering and leaving the meeting appearing in front of the message, this could be solved by putting this feature in the top instead, sometimes your message hides behind the keyboard. This version also doesn't allow to see the chat at the same time as the meeting. Please comeback with the older version and we will all pretend this version never happened."

            "My experience has been awful. After the 1 month free premium trial I tried to cancel my subscription it would not let me. Day 6 of trying to get a refund, countless hours spent on the 'live chat' feature which kicks you off every 3 minutes. Emailed them with link below. Haven't heard anything yet. This is incredibky disappointing and shows that I cannot support this company with my money as it seems impossible to speak to someone or get an issue resolved. Utterly disappointing customer service.",
            "For a professional tool, there are way too many bugs. For instance, when someone sends us a connection request, we can't click to see their picture. It simply doesn't open. Same thing happens with replying to their message. Unless we accept the connection, go back and enter into the person's profile properly, many features don't work. Sometimes the app needs to be restarted in order for it to start working again. A month after this review still no info from the developers team... Disappointing.",
            "I really like LinkedIn app but I guess your app is couple of steps behind your website. Watching live events on the app is just like being tortured! Comments cover the screen in landscape mode, and if you want to turn it back to portrait mode, the screen becomes too small that makes it impossible to read a single word! Would you please fix it ASAP?",
            "The app is useless for the last few days. I'm following a highly active community on LinkedIn. But same posts from 3-4 days back is always there on top of my feed. No matter how much I refresh the feed, new posts won't appear. I tried everything from clearing cache to reinstalling the app. The feed is like my profile now. There are posts I've liked and commented. Even if there are no new activities on the post by my connection, it's still there.",
            "It will be nice if you were able to edit a conversation piece that you accidentally sent that had mistakes, and that you wanted to correct or unsend. Example if you were sending date each text message (case in point this a speech to text) and there a lot of errors in it. Then you accidentally send it. You can't unsend it. It should be a way to fix an error after it's been sent or unsend something."

The characters are expensive and the guns are also expensive you can, you spin paying only cash but you don't get alot cash and you also don't get cash for killing zombies and completing missions I think you only get when you purchase it when level up. Guys I think you add something in the new update of this game to allow us to earn cash more easily. This is a good game it's just hard and I recommend it hope y'all enjoy",
            "I like this game but its player doesn't have more health to survive . One cut zombie almost 10 percent of health goes down if must be improved. And its item guns needs too much money to get purchased it should be improved they need to low the price . But it is a interesting game 😡",

I think the same thing will happen on My Talking Tom 2! I love Talking Angela sooooo much! Even though people say there's a man in her eyes, I never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever see the man. Talking Angela is sooooo cute!",
            "So I was playing I noticed a vid that came up on YouTube ig was on the news too so I went to check it out and when I came back at first I didn't believe it then wen I got back I saw that the makeup was off her face and floating in the air. I when back where you download it and then saw the pictures of a man in her eyes. I went to go crash my phone the I heard something in the woods so I looked the doors around my house. Then my sister was asleep and I fall asleep too.",
            "Omg literally I just played this from I year and I was playing and I notice that the app is haunted but I love the cat so what just happened is that I just open the app today and angela eyes were red and It was like someone is there behind her and I just ran that time to show that to my parents and there was no one in the chair but I though that it may be some problem of phone and I told hi angela she told hi I am a devil ,i am a devil,and that time i was very scared and i dont want to keep that",
            "I haven't played this game yet I did this ad before I started and going in the game but I heard it's very creepy and if you zoom into the eye then you can see a manner something then yeah I just look on YouTube and I saw a bunch of pictures I mean and then I see that someone is watching you when you play the game so I'm very scared to start of the game right now so yeah wish me good luck so I won't die okay",
            "I was playing and I noticed that there was something or someone in her eye. I saw some things that looked like an and a couch. I screenshoted the eyes and saw those. I thought it was really creepy. I instantly deleted the game after I discovered the things in the eyes. Kids don't download this game without your parents. I think the person that made the game was the person in the eyes. I rate this 1 star cause I thought it was creepy and uncomfortable having someone just staring at you, thats all"

Also add some more cues please I seem to have all of the current list. I like the star difficulty system, but could there be a player star amount? To see how skilled you get? Great game, I love it!!!!",
            "poor controls, limited items on store, i expect to have tables in store but there is nothing. pls expand the store. and add more levels in 8ball and 9 ball module. and pls add a reward redeem module that will allow us to buy items using tickets",

            "Absolutely hate what you did to this app. You had unique photo styles and great filters to accompany them. You reinvented your app to look and do what every other photo edit app has already been doing. Problem is, your new design is just the base editing tool for countless apps. They offer much more than these basic settings. Very disappointed with the changes. Plus now there is an ad every 3-4 clicks now. This app is just the price of entry tool for most photo edit apps.",

The game itself is functional and has a few songs to play, but there is 500 others like that on the market that don't behave like scams. Oh by the way uninstalling will not unsubscribe you, you have to go to the play store->hamburger menu->subscriptions. Yes I know the first three days are free. It is still a joke.",

Its something different to give a trial version, but not letting you continue without subscription, thats some next level scam. Let the user decide if they want all the features."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

The layout is completely different, certain options have been removed, and anything that actually made the app useful has been ruined or removed. The ads every 5 seconds certainly dont help. It's useless now; severely disappointed.",

When the name changed I got furious thinking somehow a app installed itself. I opened the app and dit not recognized it. Luckily I had sceen shots of my icons abd this is the only way I figured out that this was a app I installed and used.

Also, the gameplay is easy and the targets are interesting. Oh, and a voice telling how many points you get from each arrow is nicely unusual. You guys are so good, can you maybe make a variant where we shoot only at a \"professional\" type target with a # of points needed for each stage? I never gave 5 stars before to anyone.",

            "I really like this game, but I have one problem. Actually the problem is that the decorations are locked that's why If we try to win the contest the decorations are locked that' s why we are failed in winning the contest. And if we are trying to unlock the decorations its lost of our money. Please can't you try to unlock those decorations. That's why I had give only three stars",
            "This a very good game and fun to play. The reason I gave it two stars is that after making a cake, they show an ad..and no matter how much I try to, it won't close..I have to exit the game and restart, losing all my progress..The same thing happens everytime. This is the second time I installed this app. I was hoping for a better experience this time But....😔😔",
            "This game is very awesome and I like the graphics they have made. This is the most stunning game I have ever seen in my life. This is the second time I have installed this game. Please rate 5 star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. This the most wonderful game play ever! I spend almost half of the day playing this. Thank you for the Table Time (TT). I love the way they have made the graphics. Me, my cousin sister and her father loves to play it all day long even when are doing work. Thank you.",
            "This game is very good , but there are lots of things which are not opens just like for example - doll cake . If we want to make a doll cake his face is not opens so what we can do and not only doll face is note open there are lots of things in this game which are not opens why , anybody will give me the reply 🤔🤔 why it's not opens , so that's why I don't like this game very much . 🤗🤗",
            "Very slow gameplay and very little of it. Half or more of the time you play will be watching very slow animations of things being done that you have nothing to do with. Cut the top of a strawberry? Wait while the game shows you it being put in a blender. This does not make for engaging gameplay. Not to mention the very first cutscene of the game stops as soon as it starts to show you an ad. Garbage."

            "This is a very well designed app. It's clean, uncluttered, & easy to use. I downloaded it for the system tools, but it comes with an awesome wallpaper gallery where you can download them for free. It would be one of the best wallpaper apps on it's own (5⭐) so it's remarkable it's free. There are many high quality wallpapers & a lot of variety so I think there's something for everyone. Just checked out the File Manager app. 5⭐! These guys know how to design & develop software! Rockstars!",
            "I liked this app. I don't mind ads at all. I understand you game developers need a paycheck. But, they were making the app very hard to use. So, I and I image many others wrote feedback, and it is now fixed. Thank you for caring about us & fixinf the issue.",
            "Was wonderful for a while and then ads covering the screen. Scare tactics ads and others. I have never seen so many ads on an app. Makes it hard to use now.",
            "Seems to be doing a satisfactory amount of useful things. I don't rate 5 stars, nothing's perfect and I haven't had it but a short amount of time. So.... rates are rates. That goes for Motels, rental cars, and even apps... as is the case in this example. Also, it offered a rare chance for me to speak eloquently and feel important. Ha ha! After all, it's a great value for FREE.",
            "Very, VERY HELPFUL APP!!! Does exactly what it should. No gimmicks, just straight to the point, VERY easy to use by anyone. I highly recommend this app as a MUST HAVE for any smart phone. Even if your phone is already working well, this app will improve on that with only a couple of taps!! 10 out of 10! 5 out of 5! %100 recommended!!! Perfect app!! Its truly a must have!!!! Try it! You have nothing to lose with this amazing app!!!"

            "Content great but app very clunky and slow, and loads of ads despite subscription. Main missing feature for me is ability to replay, pause & fast forward interviews. I watch it for an hour or two day, more some days. Ads feel like 30%, and I assume they are filling the time between interviews. Mostly I don't need to watch the interviews live; they should all be available to watch later, skipping the ads, or most of them. (They only have a repertoire of 4 or 5 ads, endlessly repeated)",
            "The app will not get past the loading screen upon opening. It just continually loads and never opens. I read businessweek primarily on my phone and since the new app doesn't open it makes it pointless to have a subscription. Shame because content itself is great.",
            "The app has no dark mode. Big No-No in today's day&age! The app has no video PIP - so I am stuck in it. They should take inspiration from YouTube's PIP allowing one to switch over to another app to read other news in app, or take notes in another app while watching the Live TV. The app's ads are a problem. It starts with 6-10 ads but it horrible because the button of 'Skip ads' has no effect. 😂 The ads are repeated again if you had to leave app, go to another app and come back. 😂",
            "I love watching Bloomberg in the mornings it helps me understand the market before I do my daily analysing also the app makes it easy to be on the move and still keep and eye out on critical news",
            "Intelligent productive news experience Well sourced and a calm effective vocal experience with a neutral voice command ..made the news not only sound archaic but also progressive at the same time ..broad appeal .and yet I'm not a fan of apps in general .I'm not addicted to tech as much as most tech companies and apps for $ think the common occasional user ..I'm not addicted to updates but if I was ..I would be listening to your voice cast"

            "Well, these are some ideas for this app to become better: 1. Add a chat room for the respective people in that classroom, so the communication between student-teacher is a lot easier. 2. The teachers should a notification when we turned in a homework and see how many of them we turned in. 3. You should be able to select multiple files, not only one by one. I think that's all for now, but I think I'll find more issues ASAP. Please start add more QoL.",

Please fix this issue. Also, a dark mode would be nice.",

            "I love this app!! It has so many cartoon-ish pictures and you will never know what colours will be in it, so that's what makes it exciting... There are also many pictures of realistic paintings of ladies under the topic \"FASHION\"... But the reason why I rated this app four stars is that you need to pay money for a few pictures.. You need to pay money for all the zodiac signs and for most of the realistic painings of ladies... That is one my my complaints. Another one is that there are many ads😕",
            "I love this app and ive been using for over a year now and its super good. Multiple different things you can color and its pretty cool. I would have given it 5 stars but the reason i gave 4 is because it has too many ads. If they could improve this then its a 5 starred app..",
            "This app is super good I loved it and it is the best app to do online painting I will prefer this Only one thing that I didn't like is it contains ads I am sure the team will do something",

            "Sends chills immediately down my spine when she chases and it is amazing. Normally FNaF games give me a flatline heartrate after one jumpscare but this is not as scary as I imagined. Great graphics and hope to see updates in the future!",
            "It is superb game but , at cat 🐈 level it struck and it shows only loding .So ,then I uninstalled it but after some time I install it then I started playing again but at cat 🐈 level it struck again . It's previous levels are super I want to play more level . It has too many glitches .",
            "This is best offline and 3D game I have ever seen I like this game so much I am playing this game from 3 years and the grafics of this game are amazing this game is very funny and entertaning I couldn't bore while playing this game this game is better than scary stranger virtual mom and etc but I think you have to fix some things 1.this game's size is too big and update of game is above 300 mb in ordinary games the the update is not too big like this please make the update below 100 -150 mbs",
            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

Perhaps an improvement on when you're asked to check if you are human will respond to your captcha direct will make it better because often times when you click on continue it takes a different direction and you have to struggle to cancel it in order to get what you want you go back and do it carefully otherwise is prone to take you else where you never intended.",

Only get this game if u are really desperate and have nothing else to do. Btw can people STOP moaning about ads as they r needed to keep the game free. If u care that much then dont play the game!!!!!! Duh.",
            "2 issues, ads and lag. Even with a $900 LG V60, this game lags like im playing on a slow phone from 9 years ago. Constantly dropping from a smooth 60fps to 10-15fps. Also, the ad situation is awful. This developer is great at creating a simple, creative game concept, and then ruining it with insane amounts of ads. Literally everytime you die you are faced with a 15-30 second UNSKIPPABLE ad, which happens often with the god awful lag. Which ends up making this more ad watching, than game playing.",
            "It makes me wanna scream, very laggy, i've noticed the developers don't look at the ratings and don't fix the problem, my phone suppers not rejester me swiping the virtual ball the ads are clickbait, it's hard trying to get the ball in the middle, overall just a sucky app",
            "LOVE THIIIIIIISSSSSS but there is lots of lagging I have a good quality phone because its lagging it's weird but it's the game. Worth playing very fun and can get a little boring.",
            "Difficult, but extremely fun at the same time. If people are complaining about ads, then turn your WiFi/mobile data off. 5/5"
