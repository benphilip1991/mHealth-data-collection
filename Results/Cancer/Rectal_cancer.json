Mistakes in cell division occur frequently. For reasons that are poorly understood, sometimes mistakes occur that escape our editing systems. When this occurs, these cells begin to divide independently of the normal checks and balances that control growth. As these abnormal cells grow and divide, they can lead to growths within the colon called polyps. Polyps vary in type, but many are precancerous tumors that grow slowly over the course of years and do not spread. As polyps grow, additional genetic mutations further destabilize the cells. When these precancerous tumors change direction (growing into the wall of the tube rather than into the space in the middle of it) and invade other layers of the large intestine (such as the submucosa or muscular layer), the precancerous polyp has become cancerous. In most cases this process is slow, taking at least eight to 10 years to develop from those early aberrant cells to a frank cancer.\r\n\r\nOnce a colorectal cancer forms, it begins to grow in two ways. First, the cancer can grow locally and extend through the wall of the intestine and invade adjacent structures, making the mass (called the primary tumor) more of a problem and harder to remove. Local extension can cause additional symptoms such as pain or fullness, perforation of the colon, or blockages of the colon or nearby structures. Second, as the cancer grows it begins the process of metastasis, shedding thousands of cells a day into the blood and lymphatic system that can cause cancers to form in distant locations. Colorectal cancers most commonly spread first to local lymph nodes before traveling to distant organs. Once local lymph nodes are involved, spread to the liver, the abdominal cavity, and the lung are the next most common destinations of metastatic spread.\r\n\r\nColorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer in the U.S. in both men and women.

Because there are more sensitive nerves in this part of the body, they are normally more painful. Straining when passing a stool may cause them to bleed. If you have external hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nAnal itching\r\nOne or more hard, tender lumps near your anus\r\nAnal ache or pain, especially when sitting\r\nToo much straining, rubbing, or cleaning around your anus may make your symptoms worse. For many people, the symptoms of external hemorrhoids go away within a few days.\r\n\r\nInternal Hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids are deep inside the rectum and not visible from outside. They are normally painless. Often, the first sign that internal hemorrhoids are present is rectal bleeding. If you have internal hemorrhoids, you may have:\r\n\r\nBleeding from your rectum - bright red blood on stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement\r\n\r\n\r\n========\r\nSymptoms\r\n========\r\n\r\nHemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal and anal complaints. The most common complaint symptoms are:\r\n\r\n1) Painless bleeding from the anal area,\r\n2) Anal itching,\r\n3) Pain in the anal area,\r\n4) Swelling and feeling a lump at the anus are all associated with an inflamed hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nThese include bleeding from ulcers, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tumors. If rectal bleeding occurs, it is important to contact your health care professional or seek emergency medical care. \r\n\r\nThis is especially important if the person is taking blood thinning medications.\r\n\r\nInternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nWith internal hemorrhoids, you may see bright red streaks of blood on toilet paper or bright red blood in the toilet bowl after you have a normal bowel movement. You may see blood on the surface of the stool.\r\n\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids can get irritated and clot under the skin, causing a hard painful lump. This is called a thrombosed, or clotted, hemorrhoid.\r\n\r\nExternal hemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by \"regular skin\" and have pain fibers associated with them. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid occurs when an underlying vein within the hemorrhoid clots off causing intense pain from the rapid stretching of the skin covering the hemorrhoid. \r\n\r\n\r\n*** Please Rate this APP and leave your reply and valuable suggestions to improve this app***",

        "description": "Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass. The stool is often hard and dry. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if one has not completely passed the bowel movement. Complications from constipation may include hemorrhoids, anal fissure or fecal impaction. The normal frequency of bowel movements in adults is between three per day and three per week. Babies often have three to four bowel movements per day while young children typically have two to three per day. \r\nConstipation has many causes. Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning when there is weight loss or anemia, blood is present in the stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Constipation Guide, Constipation Disease Management & Constipation Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Constipation Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

An application allowing quick access to these useful tools during clinical routine was required, and RadioModels was designed for that reason.<br><br><b>Eye-catching charts:</b><br>RadioModels comes with an advanced graphical calculator for visualizing interactively data in a way that is more easy and intuitive to understand the results.<br><br>The following models are included:<br><br><b>Breast Cancer:</b><br>- Breast Fibrosis Risk after Radiotherapy<br>- Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence (boost versus no boost)<br><br><b>Esophageal Cancer:</b><br>- Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation<br>    <br><b>Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma:</b><br>- Post-Operative Chemoradiation<br>    <br><b>Gallbladder Cancer:</b><br>- Post-Operative Chemoradiation<br><br><b>Head &amp; Neck Cancer:</b><br>- Conditional Survival<br>- Post-Operative Radiation for Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Cancer<br><br><b>Lung Cancer:</b><br>- Post-Operative Radiation for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer<br><br><b>Pancreas Cancer:</b><br>- Post-Operative Chemoradiation<br><br><b>Radiobiology:</b><br>- Linear-Quadratic-Linear (LQL) Cell Survival Model with Corrections for Damage Repair and Repopulation Effects<br>- Normal Tissue Complication Probability (Lyman-Kutcher-Burman)<br>- Isodose-Based Morbidity and Mortality Methodology<br><br><b>Radiogenic Cancer Risk:</b><br>- Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII Phase 2)<br><br><b>Rectal Cancer:</b><br>- Conditional Survival<br><br><b>Thyroid Cancer:</b><br>- Cause-Specific Mortality for Differentiated Thyroid Cancer<br><br><b>Supported Operating Systems:</b><br>- Windows 64-bit<br>- Linux 64-bit<br>- Android 4.1 (API 16) or higher<br><br>Builds for Windows and Linux are available at http://oncodesk.com/radiomodels.html<br><br>Important Consumer Information: The Software has been designed for research purposes only and has not been reviewed or approved by the Food and Drug Administration or by any other agency.

        "description": "David Omenukor Foundation is a health-based nongovernmental organization powered and driven by the passion of reducing or stopping the scourge and devastation of cancer in the world. The foundation does this by creating awareness and providing information on the necessary steps needed to combat cancer in our society. To this end, the foundation provides free colorectal cancer screening to rural and other underserved communities with no access to healthcare.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n ​Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The American Cancer Society 2016 estimates that 1,685,210 new cases of cancer and 595,690 cancer-related deaths will take place in the United States. In the same period, 57,740 new cases of cancer and 16,910 cancer-related deaths are expected in Asia, Africa, Native Hawaii and the Pacific Island. Similarly, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the USA. However, it is preventable, treatable and if found early can be cured, which lays emphasis on the fact that early detection saves lives.\r\n \r\n The decision to establish this Foundation in 2014 was to immortalize my late husband David Omenukor whose untimely and preventable death in 2013 was caused by colon cancer. The late David Omenukor was a healthcare provider like myself and we provided quality healthcare to thousands of people, yet he succumbed to colon cancer.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n The circumstances surrounding his death have forced me to realize that there was vital information on the prevention, and early detection of colon cancer that was ignored. This situation is still very prevalent and many more people carry on with their day-to-day activities oblivious of the danger of this disease, which is the challenge that the David Omenukor Foundation seeks to address.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n ​As his family, we resolved that though he has passed on, he should never be gone since he was a good husband, father, and a patriotic citizen. Therefore, we decided that the Foundation should become a platform to create awareness about the dangers of colorectal cancer and get people to appreciate the benefits of early screening of cancer with the aim of preventing the fate that befell David, my late husband, from befalling anyone else. We are aware that many lives will be saved if you help us to accomplish the mission of the Foundation.",

Common causes include slow movement of stool within the colon, irritable bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation.

You get them from having sex with someone who has the virus that causes the warts to grow.\r\n\r\nYes, warts are caused by a virus. The human papilloma virus, or HPV, causes warts. Unlike the flu, once you get HPV, the virus can stay in your body even if you don't have warts that you can see.\r\n\r\nThere are over 100 kinds of HPV. Almost half of all the people in the United States have one of the types of HPV. For most people, HPV and the warts it causes are not a problem. A few kinds of HPV can be a problem for women. These kinds of HPV may cause cancer of the cervix the mouth of the womb. If you have an annual Pap test, you can find out if you have HPV. You also can find out if the kind of HPV you have can cause cancer. If you have one of the kinds of HPV that can cause cancer, your health care provider may suggest that you have more tests or treatments to get rid of any abnormal cells on your cervix. It will be very important that you get a Pap test every year if you have HPV.",

            "Fair warning- these guys are Grade A scammers. You know what's not fun? Rushing to turn in a paper only to have the scanning app you've been using without issues suddenly lock, with no warning, unless you pay them 20 dollars, just casually holding you hostage. In a panic, you fork over 20 dollars because what else are you gonna do? Anyway your paper ends up late, AND you're out 20 bucks. The kicker? They then ask you to rate the app. The only clickable option? 5 stars. These guys are dirtbags.",
            "Was perfect for years. Always used it to turn in homework. Now it doesn't save anything to your phone. Use CamScanner instead. It offers a student version that's way better and saves a PDF to your phone.",

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5⭐",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including • More materials • More space • And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

CAM is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care. \r\n\r\nPeople use CAM therapies for a variety of reasons including:\r\n• To help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain, and fatigue\r\n• To comfort themselves and ease the worries of cancer treatment and related stress\r\n• To feel that they are doing something more to help with their own care\r\n• To try to treat or cure their cancer\r\n\r\nThese therapies aim to treat the body and the mind.\r\n \r\nIf you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your Cancer, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. It is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. \r\n\r\nIs there Cancer cure through Baking Soda?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage your Cancer is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in managing Cancer with alternative techniques.\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments. \r\n\r\nIs any of your loved ones suffering from Lung, throat, skin, breast, prostate, colon, bladder, ovarian, liver, cervical Cancer, or testicular Cancer..? Do you want to know the signs, symptoms or Cancer survival rate? \r\n \r\nThis app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your Cancer and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care. This is a Wellness app which you can do it yourself. However one may need Medical or Expert advice for certain protocols.

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "I have had this app since 2012 and it has been going down hill ever since. There are many bugs and glitches with the chat. The worst part for me is that the app is turning into an unmoderated conservative racist community. Posts that promote racism and fascism get featured daily and even the ads promote felonies... yes, felonies. Overall, this app is not funny, it is now just a hateful community with a political agenda.",
            "They took the shuffle option off featured. This limits the amount of time I actually use the app a day, considering I don't want to veiw the same pictures every time I open the app. 2/9/20 Not only have they not replaced the shuffle button, there's now an add that plays music, you can't click on it and it will CONTINUE to play music until you actually close the app. Not to mention, if you get push notifications, they show a feature out of the set. Most of the time its porn. Ridiculous. 10/18/20",
            "never use the app, the reason I'm reviewing is that when my friend would send me a link and text messages, it would open in chrome on my phone. this would be fine, but it obscures whatever meme or video there is, and says to have to continue. If you tap, it does not play the video, it brings you to the play store to install the app. I tried to work around it within chrome, but it does not seem to be possible. I consider this practice predatory as far as apps are concerned, and that is not okay.",
            "A majority of the features are just posted by bots. By blocking 10 accounts, I've successfully managed to avoid seeing well over half of the posts in the featured section. I've been here for years, and even the \"ifunny support\" bots weren't this annoying. If this keeps up, the app will find itself without a loyal userbase very, very quickly. DMs are broken now too, and keep bugging out weekly. The app is also growing increasingly laggy and slow.",
            "In the past I complained about the app crashing and horribly toxic community that consistently goes unmoderated. Not only are these still issues, but there are now more issues on top of this. The featured posts on the app are 9/10 times made by an account that is only a couple of days old. In my eyes, this means people are paying for their posts to be featured (which is the opposite of how they say the feature system works). I'd complain more, but I'm out of characters. Don't download. Waste."

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

Minus: getting notifications and info on all the stuff I don't like at all (looking at you UFC). Wish I could select what things I don't want to see. Minus x 2: very often when I tap to open an article, it goes to a completely different article. This happens probably 20% of the time I'm on the app.",
            "If you want to read an article it will work...sometimes, or it will just give you an article that it decides you want instead. Want to stream something, sure, just get comfy as it buffers every 20 seconds or so whether it's your mobile device or you PC so a college game takes 5 hours, not that you can seen it properly because of pixelated buffering. This doesn't happen in any of my other streaming services, just this. Worldwide leader in sports, dumpster fire of digital media.",
            "Too many bugs. Many articles do not load completely and some just load the first few lines and then nothing but vertical lines. It's a mess! The loading issue was fixed, but now the article links take you to the wrong story. Streaming is ok, but it does drop out too much. Update: loading issues fixed but the links are always messed up. Clicking on a story takes you to a completely different story.",
            "I have the espn, disney, hulu bundle. Espn app works 10% of the time. I'm constantly trying to log into my provider to watch live TV. Tonight I tried to watch a college football game on espn3. It keeps telling me that Im not authorized to watch the stream, which is false, or it can't authentic my provider. This is more than annoying. I pay a subscription for your app and it doesn't even work right have of the time.",
            "Update: October 9. Still buffering for pretty much everything. I just download stuff over night and watch offline. Recently, sound is not synchronized with video. Really hard to believe how bad this app is. Original post: Even with measured 200-300mb download speed, the app buffers repeatedly. I don't know if it is a server side issue or the app itself. However, I can only rate my app experience as average, at best. And, compared to services like Netflix, it is far below average."

            "I installed this app on my account for the first time back in 2014, at the time I paid to get all services unlocked and it was great it was only a one time payment.... the app kept growing and improving, mostly because they added a cloud service. In 2019 I decided to pay monthly just because I needed to sign a document. After I realized I could sign any document in pdf with a pdf reader I decided to stop paying. So what happens with the money I paid a long time ago? Do I need to pay monthly?",
            "It was dumb of me to rate this app 4 stars, specially when most of then times I try to share my work on Google classroom, it shows a blank class which frustrates me. The ads are annoying and also the sharing is so slow, it buffers for 5 minutes, and no, my WiFi Isn't the problem here. Don't use this app specifically when you are sending work last minute, it delays you.",
            "I did not upgrade so I guess I am way ahead of the game, I still have a very usable cam scanner. However, yesterday I tried to use the scanner that I have used for so many years and it simply would not allow me to go through the program to a finished downloadable product. Constantly asking me to subscribe. I have given up. It allows a download for free but it can not be used for free. No more for me. I will find something else.",
            "It's like having acrobat, printer, pdf creator, microsoft picture manger in one. Super easy to just click the high qualitypic of the document/ card/qr code etc. and customize it if you want, send in as a jpg or pdf reduce size and share via different platforms like Gmail/ messages/ fb etc.. all these in less than a minute..",
            "Too expensive. I use this app occasionally for scanning documents. Wanted to support the developer and buy a \"Pro\" version. Turns out that Premium is $50 bucks a year! No way! So instead of receiving a reasonable payment of, say, $4.99 (which is what they should be charging) they get nothing. Oh well! ☹️"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "Very nice game, I always wanted a game that 1. Was like salt 1 and salt 2 2. A game with no ads and doesn't sell personal information. 3. A developer that supports the game and the people who play it. 4. A game that only takes 2MB! However, I do wish that you could after saying Never to that prompt for the membership, you could still have an option to buy the membership without re installing it. Thats my only complaint, other than that, the game is fun and enjoyable, I recommend installing.",
            "I really like it, but there's some things that really annoy me. The uranium shouldn't always go critical and explode as there's plenty of options in game to keep it cool (specially in small quantities) and when under pressure liquid nitrogen as well as other liquids should remain there instead of simply disappearing. I would love to provide better feedback and help you improve this engine. It's really fun, but frustrating.",
            "I am obsessed with this game. It's so relaxing and gives me so much creativity to do whatever I want. I can cause absolute chaos, experiment with different materials that correspond with real-life physics, cause more chaos after getting distracted from my experiment. And it is so relaxing and satisfiying. Not to mention ad free, bless these people. 10/5 stars if I could",
            "When I was in 5th or 6th grade my friends and I were all obsessed with a game similar to this on one of the popular flash game sites of the time (this is over 15 years ago, like before Numa Numa Dance). I haven't seen another game like it since, so it's a really nice to see someone bring it back. We used to kill hours with that game back in the day, and I can see I'm going to be doing the same now! There's some suggestions I could make, but the dev is well on their way to perfection as-is.",
            "As a kid I just loved playing in the sandbox. This sandbox is even better than the one that I played in as a kid, all the different elements for one thing are so much better. And I never even found one cat turd. Thanks for omitting the cat turds, although I would like to see what the reaction would be between cat turds and crud oil mixed. And exposed it to a flame. Thanks to the developers of the game and the fact that you have no ads. Thanks again, Big \"D\"🙈🙉🙊"

            "Paid user. Impressive design. Not easy to use early on but once you get the hang of it... One issue: Why do 'copy' and 'move' don't let me choose location? Am forced to use 'copy to clipboard' to Copy as well as Move a file. Please fix this or let me know if there is a workaround. Thanks. I read the manual. Exactly the same thing. Why can't it be simplified as in copy to destination of my choice directly?",
            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "Challenging game, entertaining. I laugh because I tilt my phone all the time trying to get my ball to roll where I need it to... which doesn't do anything. I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "It do help a bit while trying to manage your Instagram account but it's quite limited on what you can do. I can't export my whitelist to use it with a script or another app. And the automated unfollow method is dumb. We don't have a way to customize how it is going to work. There's no way you can report problems or contact the developer inside the app, which is a bummer. We can't sync the list of people that unfollow the profile you tracking. There's room to improve this app.",
            "Much better than the original. I switched from this to a professional paid software for a few years. But since the changes insta made I got rid of the automation. I like that it doesn't scrape everything everytime you go on the app. And that you can now do it manually. Tip 1: Use 4g/5g Tip 2: Do it manually(click image and unfollow inside insta app) Tip 3: Dont do too many at once. Maybe 20 max and spread it over the day Tip4: Dont scan too many times. Try to restrict this to 1 or two at most.",
            "Absolutely very helpful app. I was doing these tasks through code but then came across it . Giving one star less because the \"Auto\" functionality stops working after one or two uses and I think that is because Instagram blocks those actions. Will give 5 stars on the day developers are able to disguise Instagram 😉. UI can be improved but I can live with it. Thanks developers.",
            "TURN OFF WIFI AND IT'LL WORK. All you have to do is turn off Wi-Fi and it will work perfectly. No complaints once I figured this out. I was having the same problems as all of you until I forgot to turn my Wi-Fi back on today and all of a sudden I was able to unfollow 50 at a time over and over. You have to wait 8 minutes once you reach 200 unfollowers otherwise Instagram will flag you as a bot but after 8 minutes you could go ahead and do it again.",
            "I give it 5 star because According to me, this is the best app i have seen for our insta id, some times it gets bugs but after some time it is again in work,it gives us features like Followers, Unfollowers of your id, and many mores, you can log in 1 or more id's at same time, but i request to the developers to remove the bugs from the app, because it's irritating and One of the best feature of this app is - No Adds😍"

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",
            "This game is overall satisfying but the controls are clunky. I wish that you could decorate your cake but I like this game. And why is this PEGI 18!!!",

The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "Very impressed by this, it works very well. Love it Add Morse code and RTTY decoding and this would be the ultimate must have app for anyone that listens to radio. Not a complaint just thinking if it grew to decode what ever is coming over, so people never have to change apps that would be brilliant.",
            "Great decoder[s] -they are very robust in many difficult conditions. Only ask would be for morse decoder for idents. Overlay or append to pic metadata.",
            "Had to uninstall and reinstall the first go around at it. The app was malfunctioning on the first download. After a second download, I was able to get it working. I was able to set it to auto mode and received some cool pics from my local radio club using my baofeng uv5r.",
            "It wasn't designed to do phone calls. Amazing how the decoder can automatically select format. Creates interesting effects when the encoder is played through an amplifier. Would like to try this in a large reverberation sized room. Working best when at lower volume not loud enough to bounce off of walls. Scottie DX is actually the only mode that doesn't smear my profile picture. I've got this encoder and decoder set on 3 of my devices. I've sent my profile picture to myself through every single mode this pair can do. Looking forward to the day I can actually use them with a radio or even home phone.",
            "I love this app, but I've had a slight problem this last time I've installed it... For some reason the save button is greyed out, and the share button doesn't seem to do anything. Is there any reason this would be happening that I'm just missing? I had to save my last image via screenshot, which isn't ideal, so I'd rather be able to use the default save feature :) I'm on Android 10 on a Nokia 7.1 Thanks for the great app!"

It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

Before that we gets not only stars but also something like 🎀 ribbons. After failing the challenge there is no backup which demotivate player. The game mode story I didn't like at all and challenges are so easy. In the game now the time has came to give some videos otherwise game Will be so much boring. Mission is getting difficult to complete.",

After I've opened the 3 chests, I tap no thanks and another round of rewards keep coming back. This keeps on going and I never get to play the game. Please fix this.",

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",
            "I have to say that the moto g9 has some serious camera issues and u guys have to resolve it soon. The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",
            "Just bought the Moto g 5G plus however the app crashes every time when I zoom out the rear camera with ultra-wide and it asks me to restart the camera......is it the problem with the app or the new phone which just opened today",
            "What's the use of hardware if your are not having a perfect optimised software ? Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos. All previous generation moto camera where doing a great job than this why this you have done for motorola fusion plus please rectify asap..."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "It is super, but my suggestion is to 1.\"allow us to share multiple documents or photos at the same time\". (we are able to share only one document at a time from the app.) And next point is 2. give us an option to reorder the pages and mark the number on the page. 3.if we select one filter for an image, it should automatically select the same filter from next time.",
            "I like this app, it's the best scanner and really easy to organise. I didn't give full stars because there isn't an option to edit the name, or edit the documents. Like scan a few more, or delete a few once you have saved it onto the device. If I make a mistake I have to rescan everything. Nonetheless, I am still using this app because there are no ads and it's a quality scanner!",
            "It's a nice app, especially if you have an outlook account. When you save it, it saves directly to your account after you log in once, and you can also choose what to save it as (pdf, jpeg, etc. . .). The only thing is, if you have bad lighting, sometimes the scanner won't pick up the edges of your paper. Which is a given for any scanner, but if you're in a rush it can cost you time. It doesn't have pop up ads like some other scanners I've used so that's also a plus.",
            "This is an amzing app. If we click a photo for scanning from any angle, it automatically makes the photo clear and straight. I could have given 5 stars to this app, if there could be one more feature in it. Today I had to scan the images of my test paper and by mistake, I forgot one page to scan. So I scanned it at the last thinking that *there will be an option to reorder the pages in a correct format*. But I wasnt able to reorder. Please add page reordering feature in this app. Thank you.😊",
            "I couldn't find a proper pdf creator and was in desperate need of one due to my exams. Them I found this and I am so very grateful that I did. Works just fine and captures the document from whichever angle I click. Only one thing, today I forgot to rename the file before saving it. And then I couldn't find any option to rename it. So I had to click the pictures of the pages again. If there is a renaming option, please help me find it but if not, that's an improvement you must make."

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best 😀",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ♥️.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "This is one of the best games Gameloft has created and entertained the world. MUST READ: I have been playing this game since it's release and have grown watching its updates and its growth. I have played it since then on the PC. And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's. And give it missing fighter's in sphere. Please GoR. when we will get new pvp and update. In my phone game is not opening please fixed the errors. From 7 days my game is not opening showing errors. Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

Whats worse all the coins you collect to optimize the weapons have zero effect on the weapons. Ill tell you now, anything you do in this game wont count for anything! Levels just go higher, but not harder. Coins mean nothing, points you get for pushing people off mean nothing, achievements mean nothing.",

I have loved the cricket experience so far and I've been a customer for about six months now and would recommend anyone with a contract to think about switching. Low monthly plans.",
            "EDITED Review: Initially it worked great. Five dollars off with auto pay via app. Cool, ty. Then it started saying my debit card wasnt up to date (its 2 months old) when all was correct. To pay over the phone or in person there is a \"customer service\" fee. So between the 5 I would get from auto pay savings and the fee I pay 10 additional dollars per month because of this faulty app. Essentially I have been repaying 1/3 of my bill due to their error.",
            "Data stinks and my phone slows to fast and I have access unlimited data. U can't even get a new phone. I rather go to simply mobile or metro pcs. The phone I bought was from rent a center years ago, it's a Samsung galaxy J7(2016) version. So it's not a cricket model, I haven't had a cricket phone since several years because I was having problems with every phone. Metro will let you get a free phone for Switching. I'm on a very tight budget and fixed income.",
            "Besides the fact that the app sometimes won't work. There is the issue that when you have a phone that's not working it's hard to get in contact with anyone. I've even tried the customer service line for my cell phone. But without being able to review the items that we purchase through cricket, they aren't really able to know when a company is providing crappy product. I've also had an issue with the last two devices that I've purchased not being able to connect to wifi!",
            "Their websites don't work, their app doesn't work! Made faithful payments for over four years. Missed my payment on the 1st But it wasn't due till the 2nd. Tried to make payments all day on the 2nd and couldn't get through. Then I get charged $15 because I make the payment 9 hours late the day after. When you called to complain the manager will just hang up on you! Even if you don't swear! Worst company! Most of them don't understand English!"

            "Highly addictive! You have been warned! HA! Love this game! Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

No reason something I'm listening to should take over my whole phone. Even apple is getting rid of phone calls taking over the whole screen. I have the note. It's designed for multitasking. I'm in the car listening and it's 95 degrees outside, screen on bright AF with my phone getting hotter and hotter. Let me minimize.",

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game 👍♥️👍♥️",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",

It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

All in all, get this app installed on your phone now, it'll be the best move you make all day... You can upload files to your Dropbox account directly from within the app also to Google Drive, plus you can also upload directly to your website from the app too. Plus there's 5GB free storage",
            "The app had always been my go to File Manager since I can remember. But, I get it!! I am not on Premium. The ads that were there when I first downloaded the app were bearable and reasonable. But now, after every one or less that five actions and there comes a pop-up to buy the Premium and an ad thereafter? Will I get any work done on it surely? It's annoying and a waste of the users time!!"

            "(1) Why do i need to allow access to my Google Play Games Account again & again ? I don't want to enable auto-sign in because i don't want to get registered to Games i am trying out everytime. None of the other games asks me to enable auto-sign in , neither those games have any problem like this. (2) Unable to Change Servers & Asia is missing (3) No Option to disable aim-assistant. Auto-Fire is Good but, enabling aim-assistant automatically with auto-fire is really a Bad idea.",
            "Best game. Sensivity of this game is best. Graphics are best. Easy to push our rank. And the best game under 50 mb. And their are more than 6 map in this game. The new update is awesome. And one request can you change the clan war settings.",
            "The new update looks shinny and new market place plus market place emulates steam workshop and feels similar to CSGO stuff. There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match. I always have to restart it to download.",
            "Great game...i play this game for a years now...but we are tired in old maps...

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

And I mean you don't really need premium to use this app, so people, please try this app. It'll be worth it.",

Add the \"select subtitle\" next to the night mode on the screen. double tap skip is very useful. create \"second to seek for jump action\", \"10 second\" for skip is very limited.

I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",

I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "when I first downloaded this game it was good ....playable even with the adds you could skip around ...but now it's worthless ....they make you watch at least 8 to 10 seconds of adds each and every time your game concludes weather or not you have advanced ....it wouldn't be so bad if you did make another level but when you're stuck on one the last thing you need is to wait for a damn add for another game!!!I personally I think they have f**ked this game up all to hell",

            "I'm awake! Just thought I would try this game, man, I hope you try so you can feel what I feel right now. Excitement is all around you, the enemy is too, get the rusty ole rifle and pick a spot, the action is swift and the ship is moving. Try this game and you will be moving too! Or ? Get moving sniper, lock & load!",
            "After level 400 it's almost impossible to continue except you spent a lot of money for Dia to remove the unrealistic wind effect every time. Upgrades like guns, bullets and so on are not more than a kind of a placebo. Try yourself and compare it by playing a minigame using different stuff. I have fired more than 50k real bullets up to distances of 300 meters in my life and even in hard wind. I never experienced such a wind effect, not a 2 ms and not at 4 ms not even with a muzzle loader rifle.",
            "Ads galore!! When will the mobile gaming market move out of this sleazy, cheap practice of freemium games, and move onto the next era like with demos, then buy the game of you like it? No darn ads... UDATE: Spent coin on an upgrade, then next time I went in, the upgrade was not available. It was like I never bought it! And I lost all that coin too! No way would I put real money into this game."

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

Also, and this has happened more than 3 times, it would say I still have to hit a few more cans but there are no cans left to hit. Please fix this. It's very frustrating esp for the harder levels when you're so close to winning.",
            "There are alot of ads running and is very pathetic.. Its like not playing the game but watching the ads.. As i have downloaded it just to watch the ads. Not Worst but it is more then that..",
            "You guys need to fix the bug I'm on level 91 and everytime I get all the cans down the counter still saying that there are still cans left to knock down and there isn't fix it",

            "Used this for years. After update, I can no longer zoom in to make text bigger and have the whole page rescale. That's WHY I was using it in the first place. VERY DISAPPOINTED and I'm not the only one complaining about this. What a stupid feature to remove! So I'll switch to something else so I can save my poor eyes! EDIT: The browser now supports the whole scale zoom and I'm very happy to begin using it again. THANK YOU development team!",
            "I actually like the app, it's the only browser I've ever used but few days ago I updated it and it's terrible. I can't go to any site, it loads up the addresses and just go blank (turns the screen black) and I can't see a thing. I've tried to reinstall it twice but instead it's still the same, please fix this ASAP....",
            "I update the latest version and it got worse than previous version. No thumnail picture and video. It happen when I open google site also for picture and video thumnail. The first is ok then when you scroll it down no picture came out. Good news is when i open or play the video randomly, its super fast loading. Bad news is i have to see the video one by one. Please fix this. My browse depends on you.",
            "I actually like this app, but the last two updates has made it difficult to handle, double clicking on 0pictures doesn't open them up anymore and the option of having a transparent background so I can use a darker theme that has less effect on my eyes, scrolling has also become slower. I hope measures can be taken to fix these problems",
            "I have used this app for more than 3 years, however lately this app is a big disappointment. The app breaks abruptly every time, if I fail to restore in time I lose all that was in the browser. Also lately it doesn't show the current sites on the browser list insted it just shows a list of uc browser tabs. Above all it's no longer a stable app. Too bad I have to source for another app."

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",
            "Cost to much ti play i have been playing this game for years i spent alote of money on it and the change up to cyber we that were playing before that had to spend much more and the stuff we bought before we cant even use even the game packs have alote of stuff but there is 80%of it is stuff u cant use note that we should have renberse use for what we paid for and lost cause of the change up",

            "I purchased a year subscription a couple months ago. It was great now in this last week it has so many glitches and each item doesn't want to open takes forever! And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "It gets difficult in the start, but then it gets a little more easier after a few plays. Here's a tip; When some of your people die during raids, you still have their guns with you when you get home. Trade those guns away for bullets. Bullets are the resources you really need, and don't go upgrading your gun until you have enough metal and wood. Always check your guys in the frontlines, because when people come back from raids, their places, with the original men, may change, which could kill ye",
            "While hard at first glance, once you actually get to know the game it is quite easy. The biggest problem I have with the game is that the difficulty doesn't ramp up. Once you get to a certain point you basically can continue forever. But other then that, this game is excellent overall.",
            "It's a fun game and all, but it's too hard to get resources. It's too hard to get through rounds and the game is overall ass. I'm sorry but the game is WAAAAY too difficult. GG fellow gamers, but this is not a really good game."

            "It's a wonderful time killing game, but once you get passed stage 45 the characters you are fighting will double in there health, power etc; when you and your opponent are on even power on all earlier stages. Then stage 45 comes and your opponent is on a power level of 2000 and you are still on power level 800, what are you supposed to do?...and even worse it stays at this unfair disadvantage (basically it needs a ranking system) (Otherwise your only choice is to rage or switch characters)",
            "The game itself is not so bad. Nothing too much to do but a decent time killer. The thing that bothers me is that ea so blatantly attempted this to be a cash grab for them. In-game transactions are not optional, they become more of a necessity. After a few rounds the opponents start coming so overpowerd that it literally becomes impossible to climb to their level without using real money. I am at level 219, my health is 9000 and the opponent i am fighting has a health of 65k. Really ea?",
            "Sad. More EA sadness. Can't move yourself around with a left toggle, it pushes you in automatically. You just spam punch in hopes it lands, randomly tapping an icon on the left side of the screen where you should be able to move, for special attacks...ground and pound is quickest to accumulate abilities on takedowns/grapples. Really its not a good experience at all, for a fighting style about \"control.\" If i wanted to play a tap \"boxing\" game, id play that AND be able to control my character.",
            "Overall, this game is pretty alright. But it gets mundane pretty early on. Graphics aren't that great either. An obvious money grabber from EA. Watch UFC and play the latest games on console, this one just isn't it. Hoping for another developer to come along and revolutionize this franchise, but until then, stay on consoles :)",
            "Could be better if the computer followed the same set of rules as the player, player can NEVER punch the computer fighter out of a special move but the computer can ALWAYS simply punch the player to completely stop any special move, computer can use body hook to stop take down, player cannot, also it is physically impossible to knock someone out by kicking them in the shin"

            "Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game, and Sonic as a whole. But this \"free\" version is unacceptable. Far too many ads. This replaced the version I paid for years ago, which doesn't make any difference because the restore purchase button takes me straight to Sonic 2. Can't even find the paid version. Game 5/5, port 0/5 until restore function is fixed (this has been an issue for well over a year)",
            "It's a fantastic adaptation of the game and I would give it 5 stars if not for: - Scrap Brain zone act 2 is broken and loops back to the start of the level -- is this by design? It doesn't allow me to finish the game! - Even though I purchased the game I keep getting one add every time I open the app - I need to be online to play the game - come on man this would be amazing during long plane trips!",
            "I LOVE SONIC but this port aint the best i would rather play and emulated version and when ever i try to use debug it pauses the game i mean come on sega what the hell if this was fixed it would get a big five stars but still i love this game and i hope this bug is fixed PLEASE SEGA FIX THIS!!!!!",
            "One of the best ways to play the original Sonic the Hedgehog. Controls are surprisingly good for a phone port and widescreen definitely enhances the experience. Only problem is that achievements are a bit iffy; it says I got the chaos consiour achievement even though I only have three chaos emeralds. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.",
            "Not exactly a good experience. Saw three ads from the time I opened the game to the time I made a save & an additional two once I selected start. After the two ads, totalling over a minute, the game crashes, & process repeats. I could see enough ads I'd see from playing Sonic Forces for a week in just half an hour of trying to load a game. The controls are also really funky, making the game over twice as hard as it should. I'm disappointed, I expected better from one of my favorite franchises :/"

            "This game is great! Lots of levels, very realistic, if you are looking for a non addictive game this one is perfect for you. The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",
            "I will say it is good app for those who really want to become cardiologist. I am intrested in these types of activities. I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",
            "The first sentence in the dialog has a typo. Decided to overlook it. It seems the dialog is very poor and controls aren't any better.",
            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

Hey game devs keep the ads in because I know you all need money and that's kinda the point of games. And have you guys gotten any follow ups from the one start reviews?",
            "This game is so cool!! I love it, also it's free and the amount of space to download it is just right. This game isn't a waste of time. Sometimes I download games/apps and it doesn't work. But this game, I DON'T have that problem. So thanks a lot for making this game.",
            "Fun game. I'm only rating 4 stars because it starts to get a bit repetitive just jumping off the same cliff. Try adding obstacles and even compete against other players and this game will be great.",
            "Ok this is a very fun, good exciting game and love it. The only thing I don't like is what the ads are for what is the point of putting ads? That's my only downside to this game but I enjoy it",

My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

        "description": "You've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\nYou've probably heard conflicting reports about cancer prevention. Sometimes a specific cancer-prevention tip recommended in one study is advised against in another.\r\n\r\nOften, what's known about cancer prevention is still evolving. However, it's well-accepted that your chances of developing cancer are affected by the lifestyle choices you make.\r\n\r\nSo if you're interested in preventing cancer, take comfort in the fact that simple lifestyle changes can make a difference. Consider these cancer-prevention tips.\r\n\r\n1. Don't use tobacco\r\nUsing any type of tobacco puts you on a collision course with cancer. Smoking has been linked to various types of cancer — including cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, larynx, pancreas, bladder, cervix and kidney. Chewing tobacco has been linked to cancer of the oral cavity and pancreas. Even if you don't use tobacco, exposure to secondhand smoke might increase your risk of lung cancer.\r\n\r\nAvoiding tobacco — or deciding to stop using it — is an important part of cancer prevention. If you need help quitting tobacco, ask your doctor about stop-smoking products and other strategies for quitting.\r\n\r\n2. Eat a healthy diet\r\nAlthough making healthy selections at the grocery store and at mealtime can't guarantee cancer prevention, it might reduce your risk. Consider these guidelines:\r\n\r\nEat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Base your diet on fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant sources — such as whole grains and beans.\r\nAvoid obesity. Eat lighter and leaner by choosing fewer high-calorie foods, including refined sugars and fat from animal sources.\r\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, do so only in moderation The risk of various types of cancer — including cancer of the breast, colon, lung, kidney, and liver — increases with the amount of alcohol you drink and the length of time you've been drinking regularly.\r\nLimit processed meats. A report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, concluded that eating large amounts of processed meat can slightly increase the risk of certain types of cancer.\r\nIn addition, women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts might have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.\r\n\r\n3. Maintain a healthy weight and be physically active\r\nMaintaining a healthy weight might lower the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, colon, and kidney.\r\n\r\nPhysical activity counts, too. In addition to helping you control your weight, physical activity on its own might lower the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.\r\n\r\nAdults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits. But for substantial health benefits, strive to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. You can also do a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine — and if you can do more, even better.\r\n\r\nKeywords:-\r\n\r\n1. Cancer\r\n2. Medical\r\n3.

            "What the heck? I had over 50 billion coins, the game had a glitch where it wouldn't let me spin, everytime I pressed it a pop up came up to try to get me to buy coins. I came back in yesterday and all my coins were gone!"

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "This is the best eraser app I have ever installed! Its smooth, easy to use ,and it helps me a lot with making edits for my videos! I honestly dont mind the ads, most of the time they're just skip able pictures unlike other apps with 30 second non-skip able clips. Thank you for making this app! 💝",
            "Ok at first but then I couldn't even choose a picture to erase the backround from. Im trying to renstall it. It didn't work. About a month later I reinstall it and after another 15 uses the same thing happened. I have to keep reinstalling it because when I choose the file it closes every one in a while . But it gets another star from last time I used it.",
            "Background Eraser is a great app! if you use the auto setting while erasing you can very easily erase the backround of a photo. but there is a downside, for some reason the adds that pop up are too big and I can't click off them, and the only way is to get off the add, is to close the app and restart. Is there anyway to fix this?",
            "Its really good! I love how its really easy and has the right tools for me,( im sorry if i dont spell right its my broken keybored) but theres one problem, when im done removing the background for a video, it just kicks me out. And also the ads, there are to many, ( sorry if im annoying) but i love ghe app so far! Keep up to work! :3",
            "Its good but there is to many ads,i would give it a 4 but theres way to many ads please fix the ads problem,but if it doesnt i might have to give it a 2 or a 1 if this gets better i will give it a 5 or either a 4 star that is all,but other than that its nice ..just please fix it"

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",

I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",

I hate that but otherwise it is a superb app",

Works great when you use it once, rather bothersome if you want to use it more. Developer's really need to fix what they broke.",

Also, could you try to do something about bridge requests... I get the Gatcha is to rule out bots, but lately when I run it, either I can barely make out the code or I get told NO BRIDGES are available by the time I get the correct code entered... Any chance of streamlining bridge rqsts?? TOR s/b the gold standard for VPN apps",
            "Amazing privacy. Works well. Sometimes it force closes, and sometimes it takes a minute to get a reliable bridge connection, but despite that this will cause browsers to run more slowly, I do not mind. It also works great in VPN mode. I can search for something that might otherwise be a question to be asked locally, and it comes up with a completely different location in a different country most of the time.

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

I have to check the calendar at best to find tasks, at worst I have to refer to the email I was sent. Making the app effectively useless. I can just use a calendar app. That way I can see the info i need at a glance without having to dig for it. UPDATE. I don't see ANY of my projects at all in the app. Just deleted the app. Thanks!!",

There is no option to enter in your password and email combination. Since my email accounts are both Gmail I'd be obliged to logout and login back in each time or create a new account and lose my work. Is it really asking too ...",

            "Great game. Superb quality and excellent graphics. The only thing is when you run out of balls and you are sent back to the home screen you cannot continue without the premium bonus. There should at least be 1 more free gamemode or it will get boring. If it gets boring you loose players. If you loose players it will run downhill quickly. Please improve this. If it gets improved I will rate 5. For now its 4",
            "I love this game! It's really good,time eating and fun! The graphics is just out of this world! I just don't like 2 things: 1.the fact that you have to restart the game every time from the beginning (if you don't want to buy premium) 2.when you miss only ONE crystal you lose all multiballs!(and the steps). That 2 facts are the reason I gave this game 4 stars. I would recommend this though!",
            "It's really fun and helps me focus, the music in the background and the sounds of breaking glass is also very relaxing, but one thing i noticed is when they tell you \"checkpoint saved\", sometimes it doesnt let you click on the screen or doesn't detect your fingers on the screen, if you could fix that, that would be great!👌💖",
            "It's a really nice game . N I really liked it just the thing is that u have to take a look at ur balls otherwise it does not take time to be finished 😂 Leaving this the game is perfect. If u r bored u can absolutely play it. It's the best way to time pass. If u r out u will definitely play the other But u will never b full of this game.😁 Play and enjoy the game.",
            "I love this game! The only thing i have a problem with is there's not enough levels. I passed every level, then it goes to endless mode i think it's called. Other than that it's an awesome game, very well made. Side note: i did purchase the premium version, because of how much i love this game!"

            "My original review was 4 stars (for the free version), and I stand behind that. Then I decided to purchase the premium version a few weeks ago. I could not be happier with my choice of using Browsec as my VPN. It does exactly what it claims to do, and it does it very well. Just to give some sort of idea: I use Opera as my internet browser (has built-in VPN), and I still chose to get the Browsec extension to run over the Opera VPN. 5 Stars ✓ Thank you.",
            "Sorry for 2 star review but you befooled us into believing that it is free and unlimited. I just wanted to use United Kingdom VPN server but it only allowed 2 servers both if which aren't useful for me since I wanted to access the required location only. Add spoofing feature. The extension on Firefox doesn't work if you pin it to overflow menu as you can't see the extension box & settings. Highly slow for even online search or YouTube video browsing. Please improve chrome extension also. Thanks.",
            "Stuck in a hospital, got me right around all the filters imposed by the public open to anyone WIFI. While. Guaranteed to keep me private. Also increase in throughput is increased enough to stream movies. Highly Recommend it.",

This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "The extra filters keep disappearing after a couple of weeks or so. I am fed up with constantly having to reinstall them. Am uninstalling. Haven't the time or patience. A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

            "The idea is great and someone recommended it to me for relaxation. But when I installed it there was only one or 2 features. I totally respect if the designers want compensation for their app, it's totally their right. But giving us the option of a free trial version with no real features bothered me a lot.",

I really love the noise, it's like being in a forest or in a quiet place. I love the thing where the screen turns to wherever we turn. It's amazing.",
            "I think it is a absolutely fantastic experience. And when aunt chole's email came that is the best part of the game feels like that in real selling the pots made by our own but ya i had complaint with the developer that u shouldn't asked us to buy why can't we have it free pls make it free full version then I'll give u all 5 stars...🙏"

            "The game is really fun. There are way too many ads but it's a free game so I'm willing to accept them. I like that you can also watch a video for 3 extra moves if needed, no strings attached, no payments, no coin cost. The only real issue I have is occasionally it won't let me place a rope in the end slot which then means I have to fiddle with the order and can mean I lose the level. It's not always it's just a little annoying, even when I position it carefully it happens.",
            "TOO MANY ADS. NOT WORTH IT. Gave it 5 stars yesterday...big mistake. One star is all it really deserves. It is fun but after each 'level' (which takes anywhere from 30 sec to 2 min)you are BOMBARDED with 2 or more BLARING ADS lasting more than the play itself!! I am uninstalling this game. Actually, all-in-all, not enjoyable at all. Trust me when I tell you not to take up space on your phone. (BTW, developed in Turkey, not the USA) It would be more enjoyable to pick your nose.",
            "At first I was enjoying it, but soon I founded it very addictive and annoying at the same time, due to the very short time they give you to solve the difficult ones, it's taking me about 20 attempts to solve just one , very stressful and it's starting to make me mad, plus it has a lot of long adds I'm uninstalling it.",
            "While I am enjoying this game as a way to relax in between moments, I have found no use for the coins collected. You use them to purchase the visual mods but you can also win these. I'd adjust it to a leveling system or provide MANY more options for purchase. With the adds, while frequent, I have seen much worse. My only issue with them is that when I first started playing most would automatically be muted. As I often listen to audiobooks this was a great selling point. Please bring this back.",
            "At first the game was enjoyable. Nice way to spend a few seconds. But the tangles are repetitive. With 3 or 4 ropes and only 5 spaces to use to untangle, there aren't a lot of options. I'm up to level 450. I have over 165,000 coins. I still have no idea what to do with them. And, as other reviews as said, the ratio of ad watching to actual game play is way out of balance. An adult themed pregnant wife, cheating husband game app ad when children could be playing is inappropriate."

        "description": "Use this app to learn about the symptoms of HIV and more about the virus\r\n\r\nWhat is HIV?\r\n\r\nHIV is a virus that damages the immune system. The immune system helps the body fight off infections. Untreated HIV infects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cells. Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of infections and cancers. \r\n\r\nHIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:\r\n\r\n    blood\r\n    semen\r\n    vaginal and rectal fluids\r\n    breast milk\r\n\r\nThe virus doesn’t spread in air or water, or through casual contact.\r\n\r\nStages of HIV\r\n\r\n    stage 1: acute stage, the first few weeks after transmission\r\n    stage 2: clinical latency, or chronic stage\r\n    stage 3: AIDS\r\n\r\nHIV is a lifelong condition and currently there is no cure, although many scientists are working to find one. However, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.\r\n\r\nWithout treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called AIDS. At that point, the immune system is too weak to fight off other diseases and infections. Untreated, life expectancy with AIDS is about three years Trusted Source. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-controlled and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.\r\n\r\nIt’s estimated that 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 5 don’t know they have the virus.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top 20 countries with people living with Hiv\r\n\r\nSwaziland\r\nLesotho\r\nBotswana\r\nSouth Africa\r\nNamibia\r\nZimbabwe\r\nZambia\r\nMozambique\r\nMalawi\r\nUganda\r\nEquatorial Guinea\r\nKenya\r\nTanzania\r\nCentral African Republic\r\nCameroon\r\nGabon\r\nBahamas, \r\nThe\tCongo, \r\nRepublic of the Guinea-Bissau\r\nRwanda\r\n\r\nHIV can cause changes throughout the body. Learn about the effects of HIV on the different systems in the body.\r\n\r\n What is AIDS?\r\n\r\nAIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean they’ll develop AIDS.\r\n\r\nHIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below 200 per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.\r\n\r\nA person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an opportunistic infection or cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV. An opportunistic infection, such as pneumonia, is one that takes advantage of a unique situation, such as HIV.\r\n\r\nUntreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about three years Trusted Source. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.\r\n\r\nIf AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised. It’s weakened to the point where it can no longer fight off most diseases and infections. That makes the person vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:\r\n\r\n    pneumonia\r\n    tuberculosis\r\n    oral thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth or throat\r\n    cytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus\r\n    cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection in the brain\r\n    toxoplasmosis, a brain infection caused by a parasite\r\n    cryptosporidiosis, an infection caused by an intestinal parasite\r\n    cancer, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma\r\n\r\nThe shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it’s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS.

There’s no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about three years Trusted Source. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.<br><br>If AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised. It’s weakened to the point where it can no longer fight off most diseases and infections. That makes the person vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:<br><br>    pneumonia<br>    tuberculosis<br>    oral thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth or throat<br>    cytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus<br>    cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection in the brain<br>    toxoplasmosis, a brain infection caused by a parasite<br>    cryptosporidiosis, an infection caused by an intestinal parasite<br>    cancer, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma<br><br>The shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it’s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS.

Theres clearly lots of towers in the game but i dont want to have to play for 6 months to get them all, at this pace, for me ill probably uninstall.",

Which are Essential to the progression of the game. I must ask. Why the change from coins to Premium currency? considering there are 10 Tap upgrades PER Floor. Multiplied by 3 Gems Plus 5 or 6 idle time upgrades If the idle upgrades were Always 5 gems a piece that TOTALS 55 PER FLOOR! ASSUMING the idle upgrades Stay At 5. A piece which is FALSE",

            "Typical google chaotic mess... Google dumps apps, replacement to come at some point in the future... Don't hold your breath! Buy an app on your phone... Can't install the companion on your watch as the play store won't allow repurchase and gives no option to just install... Am at the point where I hope google does get split up by the US senate... Maybe then we will get some competition and decent freaking applications with support!! Google currently SUCKS!",
            "I have tried to connect my Oppo watch. Application freezes at 8-10% I have tried previous versions, nothing... Tried other devices the same... Disappointing. Now I must wait for Google to fix this so I can use my smartwatch.... Till then I can admire it in its box. I was a huge fan of wear os... From now on.... NEVER AGAIN :) :)",
            "Functional but I do feel it's gone backwards. I don't even have the option to show battery levels now. Must be something wrong in the licensing agreements as less and less people despite this being the future of tech seem to be using. Mobile and search being Googles main stay. Feels the same for Home platforms. I'm a Google fan but watch out for the monster that ate blackberry",
            "I recently updated this app, and none of my notifications pop up anymore! They don't even notify me until I have to open up my phone again, is there anyway possible ya'll can fix this?",
            "Ever since I update the application, I can't even receive any notifications (whatsapp, IG, Facebook, email etc). I have tried restarting my Oppo Watch four times and and my phone three times but to no avail. I don't want to do a factory reset my watch since I dont want to lose my data and especially since I can't guarantee it will works as usual. And please dont tell me to inform this on your Wear Os Community because I did emailed to you yesterday and I haven't receive any feedback from you."

I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",

            "I absolutely love this app! Moving away from the big tech companies is doing this human really good!! I don't like to be influenced in my advertising or my feeds. Nobody gets to manipulate me! every time I search I get exactly what I'm looking for and even more articles than Google would have ever provided! The best part is it's private! Nobody's sharing my information! Tell your friends take control of your life!!",
            "I've been using this for quite awhile now & have made it my default browser. I love the privacy aspect- especially now that we're in the middle of the election. I don't get the SPAM emails that I do if I use the typical Android browsers. DDG has all of the functionality that other browsers do but the best one is being able to delete my browsing data without a trace, & it auto blocks cookies( which media & shopping sites don't like, but I think it's great.) It's also very user friendly.",
            "I've been using this browser for 1 1/2 years with no problems until 2 weeks ago. When I tried to login to a site I use regularly I got a message saying it doesn't support Safari 4 and I keep getting this message since then. I could use chrome, but I don't want to. I sent 2 emails to the developers last week. They haven't replied. Disappointing! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Didn't solve the problem. If I had gotten a reply from technical support I would have rated it a 5.",
            "All it really needs is a built in ad blocker and it would be the best private browser you'll ever really find. Its speed makes it an amazing \"default\" browser for quick use, and the ability for it to automatically erase your data after a period of inactivity is priceless! But until it can block ads, I still have to primarily use other browsers for YouTube and leisure browsing. Without that important function (which is a basic standard today), it still falls under a very niche browser.",
            "Wowser Browser! DDG allows me options that none of the others do. For example, it allows copy & paste a host of things with ease much like Chrome without the peeking over your shoulder cookie monsters. It isn't such a hassle to save your favorite/ most visited sites. Sounds simple enough. But to my frustration with the exception of a few browsers, you have to literally manually save a site that you just want the browser to open up to automatically. I love DDG!"

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

It's extremely important that all Monday screen types do rotate landscape & portrate properly to make it usable. Yes I have already sent you screen shots. In apps such as Calendar, Zoom, Office, WhatsApp, Gmail etc etc all screens rotate properly, but not in Monday. Hope you'll fix it soon.",

            "I love this app. The slimes realistic, and when you tap or drag the screen, the slime reacts as if it was a real slime. It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

At that time Iwas going to play Exploration Lite, then (Because I was a kid and this was new for me) when I opened Exploration Lite, it's Kiloblocks Lite and I am scared becsuse it is not Exploration Lite anymore. Then I played dis and it is so fun. I like this and played, so many new blocks and dis game does know what it needs and not. I build so many. Thank you forso many memories",
            "Alright, I'm rating this 5 stars for giving me so many memories. I remember asking for my moms phone to play \"Exploration Lite\". If you didn't, this game used to be called that. But I remember different terrain and more blocks to use. I don't really know why they removed these features. It made the game fun when you don't have the real Minecraft. But seriously, this game has given me so much nostalgia just by playing it. Thank you for the fun memories.",
            "I love this game! It does need to update it. There should be a save button. I should not worry about closing the tab by accident and my build being gone. They also need to have more inventory to build with. This game would also be really fun if you could play with others, for example put in a code and your friend could join.. Overall it is a good game but PLEASE ADD A SAVE BUTTON AND A FRIENDS MODE!",
            "The game brings back memories back when this game was called Exploration Lite. I remember the time I made a big square house and then I pressed recent tab and all my progress was gone lol. I loved this game... Still do. This was when Google Play was called Play Store - The good times. I had a lot of games - Moshi monsters, glow hockey, Temple Run 1, 2 and every OG game. Now Google Play is riddled with good games that are ruined because of in-game ads and marketing ads. (99% fail etc)",
            "When I was scrolling down my library page on my phone I found this and just gave me a wave of nostalgia this was the Minecraft when you can't afford it I remember building a wal mart and it was so satisfying when I completed it but it didn't have a save feature so it didn't last for very long anyways it was a good game."

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",
            "Some of the fonts in other apps have change to outline after using this spp. I like help but not unnecessary changes. It is hard to read outline words. Hope you can look into this matter. Will things be back to normal should I uninstall this app.",

            "Terrible, terrible app. Unlock your phone and see an app. Unlock your phone to see the weather you never asked for. Whenever you plug it in to charge, it locks the phone. More of an inconvenience than useful"

            "Hey guy's I'm on season 89 an I've a massive time out lost so much that i spent four hours playing the event this morning an when I went to log back in it went back to the start. So can someone please have a look at what is going on an try to fix it. I don't pay for anything I just send the time watching the ads an I've been playing trailer park boys for almost 3 years now so if you could have a look at what is going on it would be much appreciated cheers 🤘✌😎",
            "I quite enjoy the game, been playing for ages now! I love the frequent themed events put on each week. The story lines throughout are funny and the ads that people moan about aren't that imposing! I don't even know how long it's been since I started this game but I'm definitely carrying on for a long time! It's the one and only game that's lasted so long on my phone!",
            "Used to be awesome, now it's all ads, and half the ads are broken. I have played this game for years, and ever since they introduced the watch ads to double income after idle, I can't catch up with the events. I've honestly never considered deleting this until now but when half of the ads don't pay out the reward, I can't even place now, and I have tried even paying actual money, ugh. And why do I have to watch these ads now just to place in events when I used to be able to just fine? Meh",
            "The game gives the illusion of strategy. It takes advantage of TPB fans, and the only reason I played as long as I did was because I thought the devs actually cared about the players experience, but that has turned out too definitely not be the case. I had to learn that just because they respond doesn't mean they care at all if you're being ripped off.",
            "The game is fun and can be addictive if you enjoy idle games. There are some technical problems that I've run into though. Often it doesn't register daily login rewards or if you exit an event and come back to it later it won't register changes you made prior to leaving the event. I've had the game set me back hours before and that's pretty crappy when you are competing for prizes on a leaderboard."

            "Excellent game that makes your brain think, but not to the point where it is frustrating. To those complaining about the ads. either turn off your internet/data, or support the developers by purchasing their ad. free offer.",
            "To play without ads, turn off your wifi and data; That being said, I would have given it a 5 as I used to REALLY enjoy this game, but as of today I do not. For whatever reason, it now removes and rearranges the tubes once you have filled a color. I do NOT like this, it is havoc on my brain/eyesight.",
            "Great game. Loads of ads, so you'll need to pay to get rid of them. It is worth the free, however, you still have to watch ads when you get enough percentage to unlock the test tubes. Hence my lower star rating. Surely you should be able to unlock without watching adds when you've paid for no adds? Big downside!",
            "Really nicely done. You'll usually have difficult levels interspaced with a few easy ones, so every time you pick it up you find the game challenging and rewarding, great flow. The sound effects are perfect too. Given the time it often takes to complete a level I don't find the ads too obtrusive either.",
            "Too much irritating by ads, why don't you stop ads displaying on my screen. While I play this game to stop my mobile data button, is it ok for you. Try to imporve your game, I can't suggest to play this game to anyone of my friends & relatives. If in case iam going to suggest this game and they are all facing same problem like what Iam facing problem with this game. They all beàt me very hard. Because this is too much irritating by ads playing between game to game. Can check it or not tell me."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

Now you deserve 5 stars man. LOVE",

So if you enjoy watching ads more than playing the game, you will enjoy this game. For me, I watch less ads on YouTube than I do with this game. Thanks for a unique game, but no thanks. UNINSTALLED.",
            "This is a very nice app. If you play it offline it will be very fun and I liked this app very much. I have no complaint with this app. It is a normal and fine game. To make it more interesting after four levels there is a boss level and I like it the most. Reccomend to play it!",
            "I liked this game, no doubt it's very relaxing... but now I am deleting this game, because some ads comes with a white screen with no x sign. And because of these ads I have to close this app and restart it again and again.. it's too irritating...",
            "Actually game is too much good,but in the 22 level one add was coming there is not have options to close it continuously running the game i checked almost 20 mints, i cleared catch also,plese solve and let me know, i will play game again"

I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. 😡",

            "I was able to find part of the Medicare coverage, but it was a guess because it only examined Advantage Plans. Not mine specifically.",
            "When I saw the display saying \"Is my item or service covered?\" I thought I could look up specific service codes related to my condition. Wrong! I could only locate generic topics with no specific yes/no answer relating to me. To me, the answer to a question \"Is covered?\" is a yes or a no answer. This app did not provide it, only \"Topic not found. \" i am greatly disappointed...",
            "When you type in things like Hip Replacement, Knee Replacement, Shoulder Surgery or any other major issues it either comes back with appliances (passive motion machine or physical therapy etc) or nothing at all rather than if that particular issue is covered by Medicare. In other words, this app is woefully lacking in information about what is actually covered by Medicare or at least the percentage covered.",
            "I appreciate that Medicare is trying to make an app to help us know what is covered and how often. However, I am surprised to see that the app was released at a somewhat early stage of development. Compared with the information available on the web site, this app is lacking much information, thus making its usefulness very limited. I will check back every now and then. If the functionality becomes more like the functionality of searching on the web site, this app has very good potential."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

        "description": "Hemorrhoids (HEM-uh-roids), also called piles, are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins. Hemorrhoids have a number of causes, although often the cause is unknown. They may result from straining during bowel movements or from the increased pressure on these veins during pregnancy. Hemorrhoids may be located inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids), or they may develop under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).\r\n\r\nHemorrhoids are very common. Nearly 75% of adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time. Sometimes they don't cause symptoms but at other times they cause itching, discomfort and bleeding.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a clot may form in a hemorrhoid (thrombosed hemorrhoid). These are not dangerous but can be extremely painful and sometimes need to be lanced and drained.\r\n\r\nHemorrhoid treatments are often searched for on the internet because they are such a common problem, and you, the hemorrhoid sufferer, want to find the quickest and easiest solution to your problem. Finding the right hemorrhoid treatment may be your best hope to eliminating your hemorrhoids before resorting to surgery. You probably have tried ignoring your hemorrhoids at the beginning, but have gotten to the point, where that is no longer possible. Turning to the internet to find hemorrhoid treatments, you know that there are many websites offering their products out in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nIt can be confusing to read the various ads which usually contain only sales pitches, and little factual information about hemorrhoid treatments.

You need to be sure that you have hemorrhoids. There are other diseases that should be ruled out, such as anal cancer, fissures, pruritus ani, and other conditions. At the doctor's office, you will likely receive a digital rectal examine, and if necessary an instrument will be used to view the interior of the rectum. Further testing may be advised to rule out other gastrointestinal diseases which can cause bleeding. Once you have that diagnosis, you can begin to consider what hemorrhoid treatment will be right for you, and you will be on the path to eliminating hemorrhoids from your life.\r\n\r\nHome Remedies are anything that you can find or do in your own house which will lessen your symptoms.

        "description": "Iron-deficiency anemia is anemia caused by a lack of iron. Anemia is defined as a decrease in the number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. When onset is slow, symptoms are often vague including feeling tired, weakness, shortness of breath, or poor ability to exercise. Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms including: confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes noticeably pale. Problems with growth and development may occur in children. There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Iron-deficiency anemia is usually caused by blood loss, insufficient dietary intake, or poor absorption of iron from food. Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding. A poor ability to absorb iron may occur as a result of Crohn's disease or a gastric bypass. In the developing world parasitic worms, malaria, and HIV/AIDS increase the risk. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by blood tests.",

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

            "I have been using the app for years! And I still think it holds up today! However, there is a worrying trend i've been seeing YouTube do over the last few years. From what ive seen, with each new update, YouTube keeps finding ways to make it's mobile app more and more genaric looking and confusing to navigate though. To the point where the interface looks more like a bootleg instagram than YouTube! It doesn't destroy the app or anything, but I hope this gets less of an issue in the future.",
            "Finally the touch interface has been reverted back to normal. On screen info disappears after a few seconds, or you can tap somewhere there is no controls to make them disappear. This is so much better than the controls staying on screen forever until you press the X in the top right. It took a long time (I have no idea why) This way of using touchscreen devices in a full screen mode like YouTube videos is way easier. You tap to bring up controls, you turn captions on or change the resolution.",
            "Every time this app updates it gets worse. I don't understand how the rating is 4.1 when every review is 2 stars or less. I pay for premium and even when I put on a playlist the screen will go black after a few videos and stop completely. I'm paying! If I want to watch videos all night non stop I should be able to, it's ludicrous. There's no customer support whatsoever. Complete garbage. I'm just going to switch to Rumble or another service. Every once in a while it'll show ads I pay not to see.",
            "This is really annoying. At first, it.was great and really working well except from a little bit log. But now,i can't even open it. Once i open it,it would say to update. So i update it. After that, it say that\"There is a problem network connection(400)\". Even if i try to restart my device,it will still do the same! This is really annoying. All of my battery just got that i spent that i used to watch,all just work for nothing. Fix it right away! This is just what i do relax! miss the old Youtube",
            "This is by far my favorite app that has ever been created so far! It's great for music, podcasts, funny videos! U name it then it's most likely to be a video on YouTube! The king application for uploading videos! The one downside is there are way too many ads. But your in luck because there's a ad free version, for a small monthly fee, of course! Enjoy!"

            "Great app! I use this to mess with my friends and family. But, the reason my rating is 4 stars is that there are way too many ads!! I hate that if I want to change a drink, I HAVE TO WATCH AN AD! This has gone out of control. Back then, this game had a fair amount of ads, but now? It's out of control. Another feature I would love is minigames. Also, please make it so that the fruit float so it is more realistic. Overall, 4 stars. Great way to enterain! But please remove some of the ads. Bye! 😀",
            "This app is amazing but there is only one problem, there's too many adds I give a 4 star rating because it puts the same ad I've watched every single time I pick a drink. Yet it still comes to where it did the same ad over and over again🙄 I like it but I didn't want to see all the ads I've watched over and over. GoodBye!👋",
            "Um it's really fun and all but when it caught changing the drinks and picking other drinks that add starts coming in... Everything is I really love the app it's just the ads. Okay the eyes has gone out of control like every time I want to change a simple drink and add comes up you don't know how annoying that is. A beautiful star but once the ads start coming down then, I will give it a five star! Four stars are good enough right? Yes it is so please fix the ads.. it's kind of really annoying.",
            "It's actually pretty good i give it a 5 star rating as we the drinks look 100 percent real as it looks in the app or photos given over here and I don't have to watch an ad i mean if someone is saying this than its totally wrong because i didn't need to watch and ad really cool game 😙",
            "Honestly I like this app, but the advertisements are just out of control. Literally out of control. Not only are they too intrusive, but they're loud and obnoxious!! You can't even simply navigate the app without being taxed 10 seconds with an obnoxious ad. These are the things that make me NOT want to support the developer. \"Select tones already on device\" should NOT have an ad barrier!!!!! >: ("

        "description": "Keeping up with the latest genetic testing guidelines for hereditary cancer can be challenging. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app helps healthcare providers quickly evaluate a patient's personal and family history to determine whether a genetics referral and/or testing is warranted. For quick reference, the app is organized by cancer type. For instance, if your patient has colon cancer (or a family history), the colorectal guidelines indicate the age cutoffs and significant family history features that warrant a genetics evaluation. The guidelines are based on national and professional society criteria that are often referenced by genetics professionals and the health insurance industry. Did you know there are dozens of genes and hereditary cancer conditions to consider when assessing your patient? A family can have many different types of cancers, all linked to a single inherited cancer gene. For example, your patient may have a personal history of prostate cancer, and a family history of breast or pancreatic cancer (as seen in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome). The app is designed to guide your questions as you discuss your patient’s family history. You will be able to determine if your patient meets referral criteria for HBOC syndrome, or another cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is available. Referral guidelines by cancer site: breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, blood (hematology), brain, endometrial, endocrine system, ovarian, skin, stomach, kidney (renal system), lung, and sarcomas. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app also provides quick links to information about labs and genetic testing options, local genetic counseling services, and web-based telegenetic services. Our goal is to create tools that make it easier for you to help your patients take advantage of the latest advances in genetic testing.",

Did you know there are dozens of genes and hereditary cancer conditions to consider when assessing your patient? A family can have many different types of cancers, all linked to a single inherited cancer gene. For example, your patient may have a personal history of prostate cancer, and a family history of breast or pancreatic cancer (as seen in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome). The app is designed to guide your questions as you discuss your patient’s family history. You will be able to determine if your patient meets referral criteria for HBOC syndrome, or another cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is available. Referral guidelines by cancer site: breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, blood (hematology), brain, endometrial, endocrine system, ovarian, skin, stomach, kidney (renal system), lung, and sarcomas. The Talk Genetics™ Oncology app also provides quick links to information about labs and genetic testing options, local genetic counseling services, and web-based telegenetic services. Our goal is to create tools that make it easier for you to help your patients take advantage of the latest advances in genetic testing.",

            "This game is the best there ever was. It has a lot of cars and also cool graphics. the graphics are even better than some gta games. and the crashings are maaaaaddddd!!!. Because when a car crash you can finish the race with your crashed car. It has many tracks and you can travel to other cities. The game is goooood!!! I need to see the \"lynkan hypersport\" in this game that is my favourite car",
            "I am only 12 and I wasn't really that much of a 12 year old kid that really liked to play games until I downloaded it and it is so fun you get to customize your vehicle like the engine, tires, paint, and other things. And the derbys are so fun to play you can have up to 11 or 12 cars with you in the derby. And the best part is it is offline. One last thing could you add a 1970 dodge charger with the engine sticking out of the hood please.",
            "This is a awesome game! Really love this game. I gave this game 5 stars! Because the controls is alright, the gameplay is awesome and the graphics is very good... What I love is that, this is not just a demolition derby, you can do racing as well! That makes it more fun to play and addictive. Keeps me busy and I enjoy this game alot! Would give it 6 stars if I could ;-) I would love to see my favourite car 1969 Volkswagen Beetle!",
            "It's a good game and everyone should get it. I like the game it's a fun game to play I have made five or six cars completely upgraded and they are really cool cars and I rely won't to now what car is under the torp I bet it a good car 🚗. I always make my car red whith red wendos and white flams it's rely cool . They also have red and white tiyers.",
            "This game is really fun but the down side is that it gives u a little bit of ads when u finish the racing on but over all it is really fun. Their is so many cars that u can buy and wheels so many things that u need to check out but I really wish their was a monster truck in the game it would be so much better."

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

I would like to have it working as before.",

I have to manually enable this app at least daily and overnight it automatically disables again. Very frustrating as I'd like to dedault to this app for browsing. Hope you can help, thanks.",

This is rare, but my phone will stopped working if I run this app. Please fix this bug, really this is quite annoying (I'm using Redmi, uninstalled using ADB)",

            "Dino rampage is an amazing game. It has lovely features. Very nice game. It working very well. I like it very much",
            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",
            "this is a very enjoyable and mind blowing came city dinosaur is extremely good one of the best and very amazing game for entertainment.",
            "Dino rampage is amazing game guys .....very nice game.... its working so amazing Great... love it try must o recommended to everyone..."
