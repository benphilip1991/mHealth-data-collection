        "description": "What is Blood Cancer?\r\n\r\nBlood Cancer is a cancer that originates in blood stem cells. Stem cells are basic cells that transform into different types of cells that have distinct functions.\r\n\r\nBlood stem cells become lymphoid stem cells or myeloid stem cells.\r\n\r\n    Lymphoid stem cells turn into lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Lymphocytes help fight infections and destroy abnormal cells. The three types of lymphocytes are B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (NK).\r\n    Myeloid stem cells become red blood cells, granulocytes, monocytes or platelets. Red blood cells transport oxygen to all tissues in the body. Granulocytes and monocytes are types of white blood cells that destroy bacteria and help fight infections. Platelets form clots in damaged blood vessels to stop bleeding.\r\n\r\nBy developing, blood stem cells become blast cells (blasts), which are immature blood cells. In the case of leukemia, there is an overproduction of blast cells. These blast cells develop abnormally and do not become mature blood cells. Over time, blast cells take the place of normal blood cells, preventing them from performing their tasks. When leukemia is diagnosed, these blast cells can be called leukemic cells.\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of leukemias. They are first classified according to the type of blood stem cell from which they develop. The lymphocytic leukemia (also called lymphoblastic leukemia) originates in the abnormal lymphoid stem cells. Myeloid leukemia (also called myelogenous leukemia) comes abnormal myeloid stem cells.\r\n\r\nThe types of leukemias are then subdivided according to the speed at which the disease develops and evolves. Acute leukemia begins suddenly and develops in a few days or weeks. Chronic leukemia develops slowly over months or even years.\r\n\r\nThe four main types of leukemia are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).\r\n\r\nIn adults, the most common leukemias are CLL and AML.

Mistakes in cell division occur frequently. For reasons that are poorly understood, sometimes mistakes occur that escape our editing systems. When this occurs, these cells begin to divide independently of the normal checks and balances that control growth. As these abnormal cells grow and divide, they can lead to growths within the colon called polyps. Polyps vary in type, but many are precancerous tumors that grow slowly over the course of years and do not spread. As polyps grow, additional genetic mutations further destabilize the cells. When these precancerous tumors change direction (growing into the wall of the tube rather than into the space in the middle of it) and invade other layers of the large intestine (such as the submucosa or muscular layer), the precancerous polyp has become cancerous. In most cases this process is slow, taking at least eight to 10 years to develop from those early aberrant cells to a frank cancer.\r\n\r\nOnce a colorectal cancer forms, it begins to grow in two ways. First, the cancer can grow locally and extend through the wall of the intestine and invade adjacent structures, making the mass (called the primary tumor) more of a problem and harder to remove. Local extension can cause additional symptoms such as pain or fullness, perforation of the colon, or blockages of the colon or nearby structures. Second, as the cancer grows it begins the process of metastasis, shedding thousands of cells a day into the blood and lymphatic system that can cause cancers to form in distant locations. Colorectal cancers most commonly spread first to local lymph nodes before traveling to distant organs. Once local lymph nodes are involved, spread to the liver, the abdominal cavity, and the lung are the next most common destinations of metastatic spread.\r\n\r\nColorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer in the U.S. in both men and women.

            "On my Galaxy S5 this app crashes every time I try to take a picture to deposit a check. It works fine on my tablet. But this issue clearly needs to be fixed, as it has been a problem for a long time according to the other reviews.",
            "Last year it worked great. This year it crashes every time I upload a check - which is the main reason I need the app. Please fix. It looks like this is an ongoing problem.",
            "I will update my review when they fix the application and am a long time supporter of LLS and Team in Training.  The app here says it requires Android 3.x but in working with LLS support they said they require 5.1 which has only been out for less than a year.  Fixing this needs to be a HIGH priority as there are several people trying to collect donations to LLS and there are missed opportunities when a valuable and helpful tool like this can help maximize the timeliness and collection of donations.",
            "Can't deposit checks because it just exits the app when I press OK after taking picture of check.  Still happening after update.   Also no option to use pictures from my phone gallery that I've already taken."

Both inherited and environmental (non-inherited) factors are believed to be involved. Risk factors include smoking, ionizing radiation, some chemicals (such as benzene), prior chemotherapy, and Down syndrome. People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk.

        "title": "Basic Hematology Guide App",
        "description": "Hematology Overview\r\n\r\nHematology is the study of blood and the disorders related to it. Human blood is composed of ∼45% cellular components and ∼55% plasma. Blood has many functions, including transporting oxygen, regulating body temperature, and supporting the immune system. The cellular component consists of three major cell types, all of which arise from hematopoietic stem cells located primarily in the bone marrow: red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Red blood cells (RBC, erythrocytes) are hemoglobin-carrying cells that primarily transport oxygen. White blood cells (WBC, leukocytes) take the form of either granulocytes or lymphocytes. Granulocytes are part of the innate immune system and play a key role in the immune response to bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Lymphocytes are highly antigen-specific, meaning they are able to target specific infectious agents, atlas of hematology primarily viruses. Platelets are the other major cellular component of blood and are small anucleate cells produced from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. This learning card provides an overview of the production, morphology, and most important functions of blood cells.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nFunction of blood\r\nTransports oxygen, nutrients, metabolic waste products\r\nRegulation of body temperature, signal transmission, acid-base homeostasis, and immune response\r\nComposition of blood\r\n60–80 mL blood/kg body weight ≅ 5 L blood for an adult weighing 70 kg/154 lbs\r\n45% cellular components (→ hematocrit), 55% plasma\r\n\r\nProduction of blood\r\nLocation: bone marrow; the spleen and liver are the primary sites before birth\r\nHematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into any type of blood cell and give rise to all blood cells through the following two precursor cells:\r\nLymphoid precursor cells: origin of lymphocytes and natural killer cells\r\nMyeloid precursor cells: origin of erythrocytes, granulocytes, and megakaryocytes\r\nLeft shift (or blood shift): an increase in immature precursor cells (e.g., increase in band neutrophils with rod-shaped nuclei in response to acute inflammation) in the blood. In most cases, infection is the cause of a left shift.\r\nA reactive increase of a cell line ends in \"-cytosis\" (e.g., leukocytosis); neoplastic increase is referred to as \"-emia\" (e.g., leukemia).\r\n\r\nOverview\r\nBone marrow is the spongy, soft tissue that fills the hollow spaces within cancellous (spongy) bone.

        "descriptionHTML": "Hematology Overview<br><br>Hematology is the study of blood and the disorders related to it. Human blood is composed of ∼45% cellular components and ∼55% plasma. Blood has many functions, including transporting oxygen, regulating body temperature, and supporting the immune system. The cellular component consists of three major cell types, all of which arise from hematopoietic stem cells located primarily in the bone marrow: red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Red blood cells (RBC, erythrocytes) are hemoglobin-carrying cells that primarily transport oxygen. White blood cells (WBC, leukocytes) take the form of either granulocytes or lymphocytes. Granulocytes are part of the innate immune system and play a key role in the immune response to bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Lymphocytes are highly antigen-specific, meaning they are able to target specific infectious agents, atlas of hematology primarily viruses. Platelets are the other major cellular component of blood and are small anucleate cells produced from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.

Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut.[3][4] The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux.",

        "description": "Hematology, also spelled haematology, is the branch of medicine concerned with the study of the cause, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components, such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, blood clots (thrombus), other bleeding disorders, and blood cancers such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. The laboratory work that goes into the study of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist or medical laboratory scientist. \r\n\r\nThe commonest reasons for referral to the general clinic are the finding of abnormalities on the blood count or symptoms experienced by the patient that the referring doctor thinks may be caused by a disease of blood, bone marrow or sometimes the lymph nodes.\r\n\r\nThe kind of abnormalities in the blood count include the following.\r\n\r\n    Anaemia - low haemoglobin or red blood cells\r\n    Leucopenia - low white cells\r\n    Thrombocytopenia - low platelets\r\n    Polycythemia - too many red blood cells\r\n    Leucocytosis - too many white blood cells\r\n    Thrombocytosis - too many platelets\r\n\r\nMany people referred to these clinics worry that they have a cancerous illness. This will be true for some, but the majority of patients referred to the general clinic do not have cancer.\r\n\r\n Essential Haematology is widely regarded as the most authoritative introduction to the subject available, helping medical students and trainee doctors understand the essential principles of modern clinical and laboratory haematology for nearly four decades. Now in its eighth edition, this market-leading textbook introduces the formation and function of blood cells and the diseases that arise from dysfunction and disruption of these processes.\r\n\r\nBeautifully presented with over 300 stunning colour illustrations, the new edition has been thoroughly updated to reflect recent advances in knowledge of the pathogenesis of blood diseases and their diagnosis and treatment. This new text:\r\n\r\n    Describes disorders and diseases of the blood such as the various anaemias and white cell disorders, leukaemias, lymphomas and myeloma, as well as bleeding and thrombotic disorders\r\n    Incorporates the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification of haematological neoplastic diseases\r\n    Reviews contemporary application of multiparameter flow cytometry, DNA sequencing and other technologies in evaluating patients with suspected haematological disease\r\n    Discusses the therapeutic use of chimeric antigen T-cells, mono- and bi-specific monoclonal antibodies, inhibitors of intracellular signalling pathways and direct orally acting anticoagulants\r\n    Includes sections on blood transfusion and the haematological aspects of systemic diseases, pregnancy and the neonate\r\n\r\nEssential Haematology is a vital resource for all students and trainees, and a valuable reference for practicing specialists wishing to update their knowledge.\r\n\r\nHaematology discusses up-to-date knowledge of the pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory features, management and treatment of a wide range of blood and bone marrow disorders in a concise and user friendly style.

        "description": "he symptoms of throat cancer vary according to the location of the tumor. General signs of throat cancer may include the following:\r\n\r\nSore throat: Pain or discomfort in your throat that doesn’t go away is one of the most common symptoms of throat cancer.\r\n\r\nVoice changes: Cancer in your throat can affect your voice. Your voice might sound different. It may be quieter, husky, or sound as if you have a cold all the time. You might slur some of your words or have trouble pronouncing certain sounds.\r\n\r\nTrouble swallowing: Throat cancer can cause pain or a burning sensation when chewing and swallowing food. You might feel like food is sticking in your throat.\r\n\r\nA lump in your neck: You may have a lump in your neck caused by an enlarged lymph node. Swelling in one or more lymph nodes in the neck is a common symptom of throat cancer, as well as other head and neck cancers. Lumps that come and go are not usually due to cancer. Cancer usually forms a lump that slowly gets bigger.\r\n\r\nWeight loss: Weight loss is a common symptom of many different types of cancer. Throat cancer can make it painful to eat and difficult to swallow, which can cause weight loss.\r\nOther Signs of Throat Cancer\r\ntrouble opening your mouth\r\ntrouble moving your tongue\r\nwhite patches on your tongue or the lining of your mouth that do not go away\r\ncoughing up blood\r\nnosebleeds\r\nheadaches\r\nTypes of Throat Cancer\r\nShare\r\nPrint\r\nThe type of throat cancer you have depends on the type of cell in which the cancer began. Pathologists are able to diagnose which type of cancer you have by looking at tumor cells under a microscope.\r\n\r\nMost throat cancers are squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cells are thin, flat cells that line the throat. Carcinoma means cancer.\r\n\r\nLymphoma and cancer of the minor salivary glands can also develop in the throat. These are much more rare.\r\n\r\nThroat Cancer Doctors, Surgeons & Experts\r\nOur team of surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, and other specialists provides personalized care for people with throat cancer.\r\nLearn more\r\nWhere Throat Cancer Begins\r\nDoctors also refer to the cancer by its precise location in the throat.\r\n\r\nThe throat has two primary parts: the pharynx and the larynx.Throat cancer can begin in either place.\r\n\r\nKnowing a little bit about the anatomy of the throat will help you talk to your doctor about your treatment options for throat cancer, which may include surgery or radiation, as well as other aspects of your care.\r\n\r\nThe Pharynx\r\nThe pharynx is a thin muscular tube that’s approximately five inches long. It extends from the back of the nose and mouth to the trachea (windpipe). Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or esophagus.\r\n\r\nThe pharynx has three main sections:\r\n\r\nThe nasopharynx is the upper part of the pharynx, where the throat connects the mouth and nose.\r\nThe oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx, including the tonsils, where the throat meets the oral cavity.\r\nThe hypopharynx is the bottom part of the pharynx, where the throat meets the windpipe.\r\nThroat Cancer Causes & Risk Factors\r\nTobacco: Tobacco use includes both smoking and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco). People who are exposed to secondhand smoke are also at a greater risk for throat cancer. If you smoke or chew tobacco, you can reduce your risk of throat cancer — and the risk to those around you — by stopping now. If you’ve been diagnosed with throat cancer or are in treatment, it’s not too late to quit. Learn more about Memorial Sloan Kettering’s tobacco treatment program.\r\nAlcohol: Alcohol consumption is another major risk factor for throat cancer.\r\nBetel quid and gutka: People who chew betel quid or gutka, which is more common in parts of Asia, have an increased risk of throat cancer.",

        "description": "Blood tests are a standard part of routine and preventive healthcare. A doctor will often order a blood test before or following a physical examination. A doctor may also order blood tests to evaluate specific conditions.\r\nTypes\r\nDuring a routine physical, a doctor may order one of the following tests:\r\n\r\nComplete blood count\r\nA complete blood count (CBC) measures a variety of the blood’s components, such as:\r\n\r\nred blood cells\r\nwhite blood cells\r\nhemoglobin\r\nplatelets\r\nmean corpuscular volume (MCV) — the average size of a person’s red blood cells\r\nhematocrit — how much space red blood cells take up in the blood\r\nA CBC test helps a doctor identify blood disorders or diseases, such as anemia, issues with clotting, inflammation, infection, or immune system disorders. A person will need to fast before a CBC test only if their doctor asks them to.\r\n\r\nBlood enzyme tests\r\nBlood enzyme tests measure the levels of specific enzymes in the body. The body produces enzymes to help control chemical reactions within the body.\r\n\r\nEnzyme blood tests can help a doctor identify specific health problems, including a heart attack. If a doctor suspects a heart attack, they will check the levels of the cardiac troponin enzyme, which the heart releases when it is injured.\r\n\r\nBlood clotting tests\r\nA blood clotting test, also known as a coagulation panel, looks for a protein that helps the blood to clot. A doctor may order this test if they suspect the person may have a blood clotting disorder.\r\n\r\nIf a person is taking warfarin or other blood thinning medications, a doctor will likely use a specific blood clotting test as part of routine monitoring.\r\n\r\nLipoprotein panel\r\nIf a doctor wants to assess a person’s risk for developing coronary heart disease or other atherosclerotic problems, they will likely order a lipoprotein, or lipid, panel. A lipoprotein panel will provide information about a person’s:\r\n\r\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level\r\nhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level\r\ntotal cholesterol level\r\ntriglycerides level in the blood\r\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, a person will need to fast for 8 to 12 hours before a lipoprotein panel.\r\n\r\nIf the results indicate abnormal levels of any cholesterol or triglycerides, it could indicate that the person is at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\r\n\r\nBasic metabolic panel\r\nThe basic metabolic panel (BMP) measures the levels of different chemicals found in the plasma portion of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe BMP, also known as a blood chemistry 8 test, provides information about the bones, muscles, and organs.\r\n\r\nA doctor will tell an individual whether they need to fast before a BMP test, and for how long.\r\n\r\nBMP tests look at the following:\r\n\r\nUncorrected calcium levels: Abnormal calcium levels could indicate a person has an underlying condition related to their kidneys or bones, cancer, malnutrition, or other diseases.\r\nGlucose level: Higher than normal blood glucose levels could indicate a person has diabetes or is at risk of developing diabetes. Some people may need to fast before a blood glucose test.\r\nKidneys: The presence of excess waste products in the blood, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, can indicate a problem with the kidneys.\r\nElectrolytes: The presence of abnormal electrolyte levels could indicate an issue with dehydration, kidneys, or other underlying conditions.\r\nWhy do some tests require fasting?\r\nWhat a person eats affects the level of specific components in their blood. For example, a person’s blood sugar level, specifically the glucose level, will rise temporarily after eating.\r\n\r\nTypically, a person must not eat for several hours before a blood sugar test.\r\n\r\nOther tests also require fasting, such as a fasting lipid panel. A person should check with their doctor whether they need to fast before a test.\r\n\r\nLearn more about fasting before a blood test here.",

Some people may need to fast before a blood glucose test.<br>Kidneys: The presence of excess waste products in the blood, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, can indicate a problem with the kidneys.<br>Electrolytes: The presence of abnormal electrolyte levels could indicate an issue with dehydration, kidneys, or other underlying conditions.<br>Why do some tests require fasting?<br>What a person eats affects the level of specific components in their blood. For example, a person’s blood sugar level, specifically the glucose level, will rise temporarily after eating.<br><br>Typically, a person must not eat for several hours before a blood sugar test.<br><br>Other tests also require fasting, such as a fasting lipid panel. A person should check with their doctor whether they need to fast before a test.<br><br>Learn more about fasting before a blood test here.",

It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period.bOther symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause. Approximately 40% of cases are related to obesity. Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive estrogen exposure, high blood pressure and diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk. Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents. Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as \"uterine cancer\", although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as cervical cancer, uterine sarcoma, and trophoblastic disease. The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for more than 80% of cases. Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by endometrial biopsy or by taking samples during a procedure known as dilation and curettage. A pap smear is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer. Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for.",

        "description": "Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skinoccurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach. \r\nHCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis C Guide, Hepatitis C Disease Management & Hepatitis C Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis C Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. <br>==========================<br>APP FEATURES<br>==========================<br>This exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis C Guide, Hepatitis C Disease Management &amp; Hepatitis C Disease causes.<br>Here are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis C Disease apps - <br>-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. <br>-\tEasily Change the page.<br>-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.<br>-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.<br>-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.<br><br>All these features are available for free. <br><br>==========================<br>SAY HELLO<br>==========================<br>Any medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

The fifteen leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.\r\n\r\nHistory of prostate cancer in your family? Put down that glass of milk and add flaxseed to your diet whenever you can. Have high blood pressure? Hibiscus tea can work better than a leading hypertensive drug-and without the side effects. Fighting off liver disease? Drinking coffee can reduce liver inflammation. Battling breast cancer? Consuming soy is associated with prolonged survival. Worried about heart disease (the number 1 killer in the United States)? Switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet, which has been repeatedly shown not just to prevent the disease but often stop it in its tracks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top fifteen causes of death, How Not to Die includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen -a checklist of the twelve foods we should consume every day.Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.",

And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's. And give it missing fighter's in sphere. Please GoR. when we will get new pvp and update. In my phone game is not opening please fixed the errors. From 7 days my game is not opening showing errors. Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms including: confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, and increased thirst. There needs to be significant anemia before a person becomes noticeably pale. Problems with growth and development may occur in children. There may be additional symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Iron-deficiency anemia is usually caused by blood loss, insufficient dietary intake, or poor absorption of iron from food. Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding. A poor ability to absorb iron may occur as a result of Crohn's disease or a gastric bypass. In the developing world parasitic worms, malaria, and HIV/AIDS increase the risk.

        "description": "Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk.",

Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

        "title": "Remedios contra el Cáncer",
        "description": "Cáncer es el nombre que se da a un conjunto de enfermedades relacionadas. En todos los tipos de cáncer, algunas de las células del cuerpo empiezan a dividirse sin detenerse y se diseminan a los tejidos del derredor.\r\n\r\nEl cáncer puede empezar casi en cualquier lugar del cuerpo humano, el cual está formado de trillones de células. Normalmente, las células humanas crecen y se dividen para formar nuevas células a medida que el cuerpo las necesita. Cuando las células normales envejecen o se dañan, mueren, y células nuevas las remplazan.\r\n\r\nSin embargo, en el cáncer, este proceso ordenado se descontrola. A medida que las células se hacen más y más anormales, las células viejas o dañadas sobreviven cuando deberían morir, y células nuevas se forman cuando no son necesarias. Estas células adicionales pueden dividirse sin interrupción y pueden formar masas que se llaman tumores.\r\n\r\nMuchos cánceres forman tumores sólidos, los cuales son masas de tejido. Los cánceres de la sangre, como las leucemias, en general no forman tumores sólidos.\r\nLos tumores cancerosos son malignos, lo que significa que se pueden extender a los tejidos cercanos o los pueden invadir.

        "descriptionHTML": "Cáncer es el nombre que se da a un conjunto de enfermedades relacionadas. En todos los tipos de cáncer, algunas de las células del cuerpo empiezan a dividirse sin detenerse y se diseminan a los tejidos del derredor.<br><br>El cáncer puede empezar casi en cualquier lugar del cuerpo humano, el cual está formado de trillones de células. Normalmente, las células humanas crecen y se dividen para formar nuevas células a medida que el cuerpo las necesita. Cuando las células normales envejecen o se dañan, mueren, y células nuevas las remplazan.<br><br>Sin embargo, en el cáncer, este proceso ordenado se descontrola. A medida que las células se hacen más y más anormales, las células viejas o dañadas sobreviven cuando deberían morir, y células nuevas se forman cuando no son necesarias. Estas células adicionales pueden dividirse sin interrupción y pueden formar masas que se llaman tumores.<br><br>Muchos cánceres forman tumores sólidos, los cuales son masas de tejido. Los cánceres de la sangre, como las leucemias, en general no forman tumores sólidos.<br>Los tumores cancerosos son malignos, lo que significa que se pueden extender a los tejidos cercanos o los pueden invadir. Además, al crecer estos tumores, algunas células cancerosas pueden desprenderse y moverse a lugares distantes del cuerpo por medio del sistema circulatorio o del sistema linfático y formar nuevos tumores lejos del tumor original.<br><br>Al contrario de los tumores malignos, los tumores benignos no se extienden a los tejidos cercanos y no los invaden.

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

            "The Game is frequently updated to force players to spend money - alot of money - if they want to be competitive! Otherwise progress is painfully slow. With frequent updates glitches are generated which destroys enjoyment of the game. Slow the update rate down, and give the smaller castles (with little spare cash) time to catch up with the 'big boys'. If not more players will leave in droves and the kingdoms will become more stagnant than they currently are! You must prove the game environment!",
            "The game can be fun, but do not play unless you want to spend money. It requires a lot to be able to play with any kind of semblance of a chance. There are people who spend so much money that you can never ever ever ever keep up and that means you will always be dead in the water no matter what. Edit: Typical response by developer which does not address the issue which is that they encourage this behavior with the way they do updates and game play is implemented. Docked one more star.",
            "Not really a fair game for new players. Peace shields are limited and don't last long enough. Kill events literally end your passion for this game. They need to enable a join feature not an FFA. I cannot beat a kingdom of 30 when I just joined 1 week ago and am at 10. As soon as I pop shield, homophobic and racial slurs blasts the announcements. TL;DR new players gets CC'd and if you don't let others attack you, you get abused with controversial slurs. More work needed.",
            "It is absolutely awful that I've been forced to tap and follow some stupid hard to follow \"tutorial\" that isn't teaching me ANYTHING because of its poor design literally dozens of times FORCED TO TAP WHAT YOU WANT and STILL can't turn that God awful \"music\" off or the sound for that matter. This is extremely horrible and the \"story\" isn't even going at a pace or way I feel remotely like I care to be forced to tap through either. It's terrible. Really terrible.",
            "Been playing since the beginning and this game is a dumpster fire now. Constant updates that make it more more expensive and introduce more bugs than fixes. Also they like to reset major aspects of the game so they can charge you for features that you already had. And if you contact customer service they will tell you whatever is broken is supposed to be like that. Don't waste your money"

        "description": "Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.\r\nThe virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The hepatitis B viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five main hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Hepatitis B Guide, Hepatitis B Disease Management & Hepatitis B Disease causes.\r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Hepatitis B Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

I've the reports, I've the call recording.. wish I could share it here.. Pathetic service..",
            "Worst experience with their service.Not at all professional. App doesn't have review option before payment so after payment only you will get to know whether you have selected everything correct or not. Tracking in app won't work. Call back from app won't work 90% time For refund we need to fill some separate form.Will update if i get the refund. If you want to get test at 10am book it for 7am. Then only they will come at 11 am. Report are scattered.Parameters are distributed here and there.",
            "2 days and not even a single call or email!! They didn't leave my back before the appointment. Once the payment is made, no calls. I'm trying to reach the technician who visited. Even he isn't picking. Nothing is showing on the app as well. The sales guy from Healthians is Gaurav. AVOID THIS COMPANY. I'm going to share this on Facebook and other social channels as well. And if I don't get my reports in another day I'm going legal.",
            "UNRELIABLE RESULTS. Thyroid test results were always higher than normal. We ended up spending more blood, money &time for consultation & re-tests from a hospital. Actual thyroid levels were normal. It will be foolish to trust the test results that Healthians give.We suffered mentally because of these incorrect results for more than a year. These are just glorified sample pickup guys who may use sub standard reagents/conditions to give unreliable results.",

This app represents comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat various types of Cancer. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you! Last Updated: Dec. 2019.\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Recipes. Most popular recipes on leading web sites.\r\n\r\n• Health issues often come our way in groups of two or more. They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks. This publication offers dietary guidance for cancer AND its combination with the following likely health issues: depression, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and stress. There are specific considerations for breast, cervical, colon, esophageal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate and stomach cancers. There are also separate guidelines for alkaline diet, anti-inflammation diet, detoxification & immune system well-being.\r\n\r\n• Top-5 items to do or eat, and the top-5 things to avoid\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. You can ask for suggestions on the best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group.\r\n\r\n• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\nInformation presented in this app is based on the content licensed from Personal Remedies, LLC. The primary sources used by Personal Remedies are US government sources such as USDA (US Department of Agriculture), NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, and leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPersonal Remedies is the publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions in the market. It is based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThe information presented by this app is updated by our team as needed and on an ongoing basis. These updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads of a new version of the app.\r\n\r\n“Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\r\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\r\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\r\n\r\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\r\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \r\nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA",

It takes at least 3 to 4 years to at least build something worth fighting with and by then, ppl already lose their interest in this game.The kingdom chat is filled with soyboy who keeps talking trash whole day coz they have no life.

I put in over 4 months to get my castle to 19 only had the upgrade to castle 20, just to log back in later to find everything had reset to a brand new lvl 1 castle my aliance members say that the account is still there but whenever I try to sign in with Google it just loads the brand new castle I have secured my account to my Gmail... I sent a report to you guys and never got a response. I would give 0 stars. Horrible non-existent customer service",
            "Have had issues with server dis connections for months. The monster hut event isn't well planned out. You need 90 rallies just to make points. If you are a new player, be prepared that this game is severely old school and only changes something once every couple of years. There are a load of similiar fantastic games out there who are keeping their players engaged. This is not one of them."

Game requires A LOT of time to progress, but new features make it easy to grow. Dont make purchases into new stuff right away. all the too frequent release of new things are usually modified in some way shortly. no solo stuff, must team rally. If you dont plan to spend over $30k, focus style on things that let you benefit rally join",

Once i logged in my gf castle, she became able to read my conversation with everyone through her castle, now our relationship is going towards break up. Because of your unsafe chats. I also have my farms chats in my main castle. Correct this thing and save others. 😪",

I lost some weight and gained it back in just a few weeks, sometimes even more than my original weight. Keto is different and this app is amazing. I use it daily to log in my food and sometimes I cook recipes from it. So far I lost 8 pounds and it didn't even feel like dieting.",

I can track my macros with no limits on the foods and they have new recipes in this app almost every day. There arre some cool features in the premium version but even as it is it's a million times better than other the other apps I tried.",
            "Before I found this app I was stuck at 178 lbs… for months. I don't know if it's thanks to the macros (which recommended a bit more protein than other apps), the electrolyte tracking (I started supplementing magnesium) or the recipes (which are really tasty by the way) but it helped me get the scales moving again. Whatever it is it worked!",

I’ve planned out my whole week and the keto friendly groceries I need to pick up at the grocery store! The recipes look amazing, but I haven’t made any yet. Hopefully they live up to expectations",

            "Loved the game from I started to play it. It has taught me patience, respect for others, base designing, to reach your goal which is Masters League im at 3045 trying to get to 3200. This game has just been a big impact in my life. I absolutely love the hero skins. In my opinion Clockwise Queen, P.E.K.K.A King and the Pirate Warden. Now let me talk about what I think you need to improve on is the Builder Base I honestly think that you guys need to look at that side more. In my opinion the walls are way to expensive it takes to long for me to upgrade them. Now lets talk about the normal side now. I think you need to work on people getting attacked and losing a lot of trophies I used to lose 20 to 35 trophies back when I was a TH9 and I couldnt reach Masters League so I decided to upgrade mt TH and I loe 10 to 20 trophies now because I found an anti 1 star. But besides that I love the fact that this game is so old and its not dying and hopefully will not. But thats it for me. GOOD LUCK!!!",
            "One of the greatest games of all time. Clash of Clans was a childhood favorite of mine. Combining amazing gameplay with the ease of playing in your phone, anywhere and anytime, Clash of Clans is the lovechild of some of the best classic CRPG and RTS games. Clash of Clans has an addictive nature, and the game runs flawlessly on almost any device. Battles are exciting and intense, base building is very fun and limitless. You can play the game any way you want - there are no limitations. 5/5.",
            "The game is still Good, no complaints about it. But i do have a suggestion, its about the clan. Why not add a section where we can see who is active in the clan even if were not in game friends. Cuz it'd be a hassle if everyone would have to add everyone that ever joined the clan, which would be kinda confusing i think. Especially for the Lead, and coleads managing the Clan. Cuz in our case, not everyone uses the clan chat when they should. So i was hoping you could possibly consider this?",
            "Sucks !!! After the last update it sucks !!! All my training time for troops is gone back to the time when I unlocked them for example I've upgraded my dragons to the level where they took 3 minutes to train after the update they're taking 3 minutes !! And it's not only the dragons and also not the only bug !! It has ruined the total experience !! And also it's Clan war league going on !! Supercell what have you done !!😒😡 And yeah your in game help and support center sucks even more !😡 Fix it",
            "Love the game came back after 2.5 years and a lot has changed since then. New things have been introduced like th12 and th13 new troops. Graphics are also improved. 4 star because me and my friends are having a glitch since our native language is not english we type in hindi using english alphabet and the game converts in astriks like ****. this pls fix it its really annoying. Rest is fine . Thank you."

            "This game is really really big. Many characters. Cannon and not cannon. Lots of events and free things. Amazing characters. It makes you think. Team building and a lot of fun. Only compliant is that they're things that it doesn't tell you. So you either have to look it up or learn it. Other than that it is an amazing game and if you like DragonBall I recommend it. The animation has progressed so thats something to take into consideration. If 2d is your thing definite 5*",
            "Great game and fun to play. There is a lot of potential but a few things I wish were a bit different. Drop rates for good units make it P2W friendly, but you can play completely free. There is an energy meter that I don't care for but hasn't been too hindering. If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, check it out! 4/5 only because of low drop rates on a PvE game",
            "Incredible game, the animations are incredible, the artwork the detail put in the game is what has made this game my favorite game I have ever played on mobile. There is nothing that you need to add to it. Just maybe make the chances of getting an LR on a legendary banner a bit more, bc I wasted more than 1000 stones and didn't end up getting the LR I wanted. Other than that, the game is 100% without a doubt the best mobile game I ever played",
            "Genuinely one of, if not the, best mobile game. The gameplay is fun, the animation is slick, and the rates are just right. Alot of gacha games have very low or high rates, low rates cause resentment to the summons, while high rates make your accomplishments feel worthless. The characters and skills are cool, but you have to work for it. I haven't spent a dime on this game and yet I still have good units because I worked hard for them. If you haven't, play this game, you will not regret it.",
            "I've played dokkan since it came out, been through the ups and downs of it all. Played the jp version as well, and the major issue to me is that the content is just lacking. There's nothing really beyond getting the new unit and maxing it. Once you've gotten a huge box and filled out your team's it's just log in for dailys and save stones for new unit. Please dokkan, get some content in this game. I beg you. Beyond that Dragonball keeps me hype enough to keep losing storage space to it."

However considering all the functions of the game I dont get why it needs an active internet connection to play. Even if it does it should've been mentioned on google play just like many other games.",
            "It is an enjoyable game nice graphics and physics.my only thing would be to make the dpad floating and so can uused by either hand as I have no use of my left it would make it. Easier if all controls could be used by the right.",
            "Love the game so far,it better then alot of the game out there, but having so difficulties with the store right now it not letting me use my gold or gems. Hopefully it will be big free soon.",
            "Needs more character customization other than costumes. Graphics look like a PS2 game. Aspect ratio is messed up on my device with no option to adjust. Creature design is pretty good",
            "2 star for now, world chat needs to be change, players need to talk not only through whispers.. Changing channels is inconvenience, feeling alone and starting to get bored.. Need to invite guild member through world chat.."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

Please resolve this issue ASAP because this game has trend breaking capability... Hoping a positive response from gameloft team",
            "Hi there. I've been playing the game for the first time. And i like this game very much. The things you can update is: 1. You can improve the in-game graphics, 2. The sensitivity is too poor if i want to look around the battleground some of the inventories automatically open up, you can fix this. 3. You can add more different kind of troops and heros. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY . Download the game . HAVE FUN 🤩🤩",
            "This game is awesome but this server issue is beginning to piss me off.. I why now you... I enjoy playing the game & I love it but having this server reconnect issues every time I try to play it... all your games are great mostly the best but you don't care about uswho are playing them. If it not ads it server if it not that is logging issues why.. why do you promotes incomplete games bugs everywhere in your games. come on guys help us out here.. don't ignore our cries... we are your supporters",
            "I really enjoyed playing the game but I had to start over twice cause I attempted to sign in to Facebook and the game glitched out. I played without connecting to fb made it to level 19 and the game just froze. Will wait until these issues are fixed before I play again",
            "Wonderful game.I like it.But there is a thing i don't understand: I didn't receive any reward when my VIP level up from 5 to 6 and from 6 to 7.You said: tap and collect your reward. I tap,tap,tap and tap,but nothing happend.Why?"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Started playing it, thought it would be 3D or as advertised but it isn't, never mind that, game is too much for my device, way too many things happening. Plus the tutorial is so long, I ended up just building and upgrading things I don't know. In fact all the building made me want to play Sim city, if they designed it that way it be enjoyable.",
            "The only reason I am not giving this game 5 stars is that there is no reward for those who don' t spend a lot of money. All events pull you in to spending money - its a choice, I know but can't some events reward perseverance, loyalty and time? It is impossible to be ranked in anything without spending. The difference in players is obscene. In our kingdom (798) it is impossible to survive without being shielded 24/7, which costs. Saying all that, it's bloody fantastic!",
            "Great Game but only way to Play is to PAY !!! If your short on money this game is definitely not for YOU !!! You can play the game without spending but it will take you forever to build. And you will be constantly being farmed by larger opponents healing your troops and losing your resources. Better to Play a one shooter game or download solitary.",
            "There are several issues with this game. First when tapping the bar to increase resource amount then it maxes it out. This caused me to loss all resource I have gotten so to attack because there is no real good way to get shields that I have determined. Alot of stuff to build that really does not help you at low levels. They say it is used as you get higher level but is very inconvenient at times as it feels like you are missing something. When you are killed you very little resource back even",
            "I really liked this game at first until y'all decided to start charging more and more for everything. Honor pass used to be 2 bucks, then 3 now you want 5 for it. You charge people to get the items just to try and play some of your activities but then you don't even give them enough. And the glitches and bugs? I've had millions of resources removed from my account, I've had issue with claiming on prize packs in my messages. It's ridiculous because no new players are added to our kingdoms ever."

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "Not even worth half a star. For one, the game is a poor excuse for a bootleg Clash Royale rip-off. Second the game developers failed at the match making system because you end up going against players as much as 3 levels higher with very strong cards. There is no strategy other than paying for the cards with your money. Pay to win game. See how little the developers care about the fanbase, because there are no responses. Why? Because it is an obvious sign that they are just in it for money. Sad.",
            "The game is great, UI is awesome. It lags sometime but that can be due to your internet connection as well. What i hated about this game doesn't have a \"level playing field\". The randomness of opening any card from the chest during play is not the right way to go about this game! It provides a luck factor which is not ideal for a strategy based game like CC. What can we do instead: start the chest with the least maina cards first and after all the 12 cards are opened, then do a random shuffle!!",
            "Love this game. Been playing for a long time but it could use at least one update other than the rebalancing of characters abilities. I am at level 11 but can be beaten by a level 6? Ridiculous. Plus, honestly, I prefer the daily games more, but that does not ever increase my castle level. Ridiculous! Overall I am addicted, but I would rather not keep giving my money away for no real benefit.",
            "The game is good. Graphics are good, characters are good. The problem is that it happens many times that match do not get start even though I have a stable Internet connection. And in a clan when we try to battle, it do not enter me in match and i lost the match. It is quite annoying. Fix it and i will give you 5 stars.",
            "Now I played for about a Month, the tournament is around. STOP❗ .... Game not worth it. Can't compete if you don't have the Super High Powered Cards to win. Don't get me wrong the game is fun if on Regular Mode, great match making. BUT The game chooses cards randomly. Your opponent can get there best cards first. While you get your Higher Seed Cards. I Repeat, I Repeat, \"There is No Strategy to this game\" -- The Higher Payer wins❗"

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Use to play this game for a awhile 3 years ago been wanting it back. I enjoy the game the story is gokd but the only thing i don't really enjoy is trying to get you to attack other schools it goea against the story and all i usually do in theae games is try to make friends with other alliances to build up reputation. But i tried that last time i played...did not turn out as well as expected",
            "The game is great but I do have one problem. Some players are super rude and inappropriate. Can you add a report player button so that interactions can be monitored by the developers and limited to friendly?",
            "I started to play this game 3 years ago. It used to be fun and rewards from events were easy to get but not anymore. If you want to get all those stuff you gotta need to spend money. Devs keep releasing new stuff and new stuff means spending tons of money again. I honestly don't know why players still spend so big in this game when bugs are so terrible. Instead of fixing it, they are making it worse. No matter how f2p grinds all day, still not enough to keep up. Don't play this game.",
            "I have come to like the interaction between commanders. You will be surprised who just might help you. What I don't like is how the game incurage attacking other schools... That seems to be the real purpose of this game which is against the story!... And its no wonder they have to revise the cities because it gets really bad! To where no one has any compassion for their nieghboring schools."

But discussions over recent decades have suggested that eating for a specific blood type may offer some health benefits.\r\nHowever, there is a lack of supporting evidence to validate the proposed health benefits of following a blood type diet.\r\nDespite the lack of scientific evidence, supporters of blood type diets claim to help people achieve overall good health and a lower disease risk through eating for their specific blood type.\r\n\r\nMore research is definitely needed, but here, we will learn more about the importance of the body’s blood type, and the purported benefits of eating for an A, B, AB, or O blood type.\r\nFast facts on the A positive (and A negative) blood type diet:\r\nIndividuals with type A blood may be better suited to natural, vegetarian diets.\r\nPeople with type A blood have been shown to have lower levels of stomach-acid than other blood types, so a meat-based diet may not be digested as easily as a vegetarian based one.\r\nResearch has suggested that certain blood types may be at risk of developing specific diseases or conditions.\r\nPeople with type A blood also have a higher natural propensity for developing other diseases, such as cancer and diabetes.\r\nWhat is the A blood type?\r\nBlood has an array of cells that are needed for proper body function. These include plasma, red and white blood cells, and platelets.\r\n\r\nAntigens are also present in blood and are responsible for triggering a response by the immune system to counter attacks from foreign substances, such as bacteria and viruses.\r\n\r\nOne in three people in the United States has A positive blood type, making it the second most common in the country. As such, it can be a good type to have if a person in the U.S. needs a blood transfusion or wishes to donate blood.\r\n\r\nPeople with A positive blood type can receive the following blood types:\r\n\r\nA positive\r\nA negative\r\nO positive\r\nO negative\r\nA negative is rarer, with 1 in 16 people having the blood group, and able to receive only A negative and O negative transfusions.Lectins, which are proteins found in food, have believed to have a direct effect on the blood and the digestive tract.\r\n\r\nThese proteins bind to cells within the body, causing them to clump together and potentially cause hormonal disruptions. This disruption has a similar effect on the body as a foreign substance might.\r\nDoes the O blood type diet work?\r\n 2014 study showed that adhering to the blood type O diet reduced levels of triglycerides in the blood, the storage form of fat. Despite this, the study authors concluded that the drop in triglyceride levels occurred due to factors unrelated to a person’s blood group\r\nFoods to eat\r\nAccording to proponents of the diet, people with blood type O should eat and avoid certain foods.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting again that there is little reliable evidence to support the use of this diet.\r\n\r\nAnimal proteins\r\nThe diet plan dictates that people in the O blood group should consume “beneficial” animal products, including:\r\n\r\nbeef\r\nlamb\r\nmutton\r\nveal\r\nvenison\r\ncod\r\nherring\r\nmackerel\r\nPeople with type O blood following the diet are allowed to consume most meat products, including cold-water fish.\r\n\r\nDairy\r\nAlthough people looking to follow the blood type O diet should generally avoid dairy and eggs, they can occasionally consume the following products:\r\n\r\nbutter\r\ncheeses, such as farmer, feta, mozzarella, and goat’s cheese\r\nsoy milk\r\nNuts\r\nNuts are a great source of protein and healthful fats, and people following the diet can typically have most nuts, except for the ones in the “foods to avoid” list below.\r\n\r\nSuitable nuts and seeds, including walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds, are available to purchase online. Pumpkin seeds and walnuts supposedly provide the most benefits.",

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "Directional pad isn't very good. Try to move straight forward and can only go slightly left or right of straight, so I just move forward in a bit of a zig zag motion. Got to the first big enemy and hit it once. After that, I could not move (directional pad disappeared completely), nor could I attack. I just stood there while the ogre attacked me repeatedly. Reloaded 5 times with the same result. Too bad, it looks like a pretty good game.",
            "Linear, not open. Colorful, but no real decision making. Couldn't even start the tutorial without encountering begging ads. Pretty lousy intro to a game, but typical of low quality, greedy game makers. Especially ones from China or non US game makers. This game is Korean, so all glitz, nothing original or deep. As we all expect I recieved the standard, insincere, automated reply from the game developer. It always the lie that shows the greed which dominates the gaming business.",
            "Went here to tell something. I did enjoy this game BUT I have this very annoying scenario when i get to duel or team pvp with players who are high ranked per se and it really sucks because it tends me, my character to lag or freeze or *my connection's poor or whatever even though I got a good internet service. Can we do something about that? I don't have other problems encountered with the game other than that.",
            "Gameplay is excellent and customisation options are great. Only one thing mars the whole experience, and that is the constant begging to spend money, the same offer came up 8 times in the space of three minutes. Surely the programming can be changed so it realises that once you have rejected an offer, you don't want it. IF I decide to keep playing I may decide to take up on some offers, but until then I cannot in good conscience give this more than a 3 star review.",
            "This game is good, but there are major problems. 1) Most PVP is pay to win I say most because if you manage properly you don't have to buy anything. But it really comes down to who is willing to buy more. They do try and counter this by giving beginners chances to get S rank gear. But fighting in campaign with S rank gear becomes a chore when clearing stages instead of fun and challenging. 2) Their team matching system is pretty wack. High lvs get put with low lvs which causes imbalance."

            "Can't log into my account anymore. I've played for 6 years with no problems, now in the last 3 weeks I've had more issues than I can count trying to log in. I've rebooted my phone, I've cleared my cache, I've turned off my VPN, I've cleared my junk files and my residual files with Norton Clean, and I've deleted the game and reloaded it, NOTHING WORKS.",
            "At first it was okay, $4.99 packs then $19.99 packs to help you advance, now mostly everything is $100 packs. I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. 👎",
            "Have played this game for a number of years getting very discouraged game will load for a day then close spontaneously during the loading process. They tell me its my phone but when others have the same issue. I'm seeing they only want money not fix the issues I'm down grading my stars to a 2 because of technical issues without fixes and it has evolved to a pay to play, pay to win game.",
            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",
            "I played this game all the time on my samsung phones. Very fun game to keep up with. Now I'm on my oneplus 7 pro and nothing loads other than the all text boxes and buildings. I can't transfer my account because I don't know what I'm pressing. This is one of few games I have spent money on, I'd like to not lose that account."

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "It's good game dont get me wrong, it's a little pay to win but it's really fun once you get into the grind. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got cold heir out of a hite heroes with gems thing and I screen shot it to and left the app to show my friends but when I came back into the app I didnt have him. Can i get my cold heir back IGG?",
            "They make updates which make the game worse e.g when you evolved your hero you used to get a magical circle now it's some triangle trash. There's not much I can say apart from bring the old magic circles back. Also they hand out serveys for rewards but don't allow you to copy and paste your account code 4 some reason. Update this plz its a simple problem to solve.",

That's just absolutely stupid. Graphics/gameplay are great tho. But seriously fix the connection issue, cus it's really time consuming for me to waste my time on lost progress."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing. They should bring in battleizers and a motorcycle game mode as well opens up the game for more options on things to do but other than that great game I play daily"

        "title": "Breast Cancer",
        "description": "Breast cancer is a disease in which cancerous (or malignant) cells develop uncontrollably in the breast tissue (usually in ducts - tubes that carry milk to the nipple - or in the lobules - the milk producing glands). It is the most common type of cancer seen in women and the leading cause of death.\r\nTypes of breast cancer\r\n\r\nBreast cancer is often classified into two types: non-invasive and invasive.\r\n\r\nNon-invasive breast cancer or in situ carcinoma carcinoma is located in the breasts of the breast. It can not be detected at the palpation of the breast, but in a mammogram.\r\n\r\nInvasive breast cancer extends beyond the breast. The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells of the ducts.\r\n\r\nOther types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's breast disease. Unfortunately, invasive breast cancer can spread to other areas of the body.\r\n\r\nAn exact cause of this type of cancer is unknown. Studies show that older age and female hormones play an important role in the development of this type of cancer. It is common in women over 50 years of age.\r\n\r\nRisk factors\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell why some women can develop breast cancer and others do not. There are risk factors which you can change, but some in front of whom you can not do anything.\r\n\r\nAge - 8 out of 10 women can have breast cancer after their 50th birthday.\r\nFamily history - if there are family-related cases, relatives of grade one and two, the risk of developing this type of cancer is very high.\r\nPrevious breast cancer or diagnosis - if you have previously had breast cancer or non-invasive cancer cell changes in the mammary ducts, or certain types of nodules may increase the risk of developing cancer.\r\nBreast density - Women who have more dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing this disease.\r\nFirst menstruation at an early age (less than 12 years old)\r\nRadiotherapy for breasts or chest\r\nEstrogen treatments\r\nOlder age at first childbirth\r\nOverweight and obesity\r\nDiet rich in fat\r\nThe most common symptom is the detection of a painless nodule at the breast or axle.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms include changes in breast shape and size, changes in the skin of the breasts (stains or creases), nipple leakage, nipple changes (either retracing or inversion), scarring in the nipple, etc.\r\n\r\nBreast self examination\r\n\r\nEach woman must be aware of the importance of breast self-examination, an important way to detect the disease at an early stage. Breast self examination should be part of the weekly routine. The more accurate you examine, the better you get to know your body and you will immediately find any changes in your breasts and axils.\r\nExamine for periods of your menstrual cycle, when the breasts are less painful and less touch-sensitive. If you feel a strong nodule or texture of a pile of sand, go to the doctor for a specialist consultation.\r\nAfter examining your breasts, your doctor may ask you to perform one or more tests and procedures as follows:\r\n\r\nMammography - At the age of 40, go annually or once every two years for this radiological breast exploration\r\nUltrasound - Women under 40 have breasts with higher density, so mammography is not relevant in establishing the diagnosis. An ultrasound will show any present node or anomaly.\r\nBiopsy - Harvesting a sample of breast tissue and testing it in the laboratory to see if it certifies the existence of cancer cells or not. A biopsy can also be performed on the lymph nodes in the axilla to see if they were affected or not. Also in the biopsy category: 1) needle aspiration - which can test a mammary cell sample to detect cancer, but also to drain a benign cyst; 2) puncture - a tissue sample is collected from the breast nodule; 3) Vacuum-assisted biopsy\r\nComputed Tomography (CT)\r\nOther common laboratory tests include blood counts and blood biochemical analyzes (such as transaminases), CA 15-3 and CEA tumor markers.",

            "To be honest a lot of post on here about the game(mobile strike) being pay to win is pretty much 80% acurate there are some times your base is better but then there comes the dude that spent $20 more than you and just claps all your troops the game has alot of potentail but is already a failing game just becuase the game devs just want so extra money. So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",
            "Cost to much ti play i have been playing this game for years i spent alote of money on it and the change up to cyber we that were playing before that had to spend much more and the stuff we bought before we cant even use even the game packs have alote of stuff but there is 80%of it is stuff u cant use note that we should have renberse use for what we paid for and lost cause of the change up",
            "Game is good, but when you start you encounter bullying by way of dealing with continue killing of your troops. Get a good alliance an you can build up. For starters slow to building up but worth the challenge.",
            "I played this several years ago and purchased quite a few packs. I have tried to download this recently and due to extravagant changes to the game, it will not even download. Disappointed.",
            "Just got the game today and already seems to be a lag in the game. Not sure whats going on, internet is working its just the tutorial part of it."

Still a bit annoying, but can be mostly overlooked. I would also like to add that it would be great to search the images for something specific, ie: landscapes, horses, etc.",
            "After trying many paint by number games, this particular one is the most enjoyable and easy to use. Yes, there are ads but i just mute them. So many detailed quality pictures with rich colors- The fine art section is my favorite. Especially during this covid19 virus, this is a very therapeutic way to spend some time. Peace and good health to all :)",
            "The amount of ads you have in your app and how often they show up is ridiculous. I get greeted by an ad when I start the app on my phone makes it seem like you're too desperate for people to watch your ads. Also, on many pictures there's the smallest most insignificant area hidden that you have to color, this game is supposed to be relaxing but having that doesn't help people relax.",
            "I love this game! It's super fun and stress relieving. There are some problems I have with it such as crashing or not being able to claim achievements, and one of the Pisces pictures has the cancer symbol on it rather than the Pisces one. Other than that I say this game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
            "It's pretty decent. You can save your progress and continue on other devices if you connect it to your facebook. There are a lot of ads if you don't pay to remove them but on the bright side it is a one time payment. You never have to worry about running out of pictures because there are constantly more being added on top of the countless ones that are already on there."

        "description": "The pancreas is about 6 inches long and sits across the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen and is connected to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) through a small tube called the pancreatic duct. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body.\r\n\r\n            Pancreas Conditions\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 1: The body’s immune system attacks and destroys the pancreas’ insulin-producing cells. Lifelong insulin injections are required to control blood sugar.\r\n\r\nDiabetes, type 2: The pancreas loses the ability to appropriately produce and release insulin. The body also becomes resistant to insulin, and blood sugar rises.\r\n\r\nCystic fibrosis: A genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems, usually including the lungs and the pancreas. Digestive problems and diabetes often result.\r\nPancreatic cancer: The pancreas has many different types of cells, each of which can give rise to a different type of tumor. The most common type arises from the cells that line the pancreatic duct. Because there are usually few or no early symptoms, pancreatic cancer is often advanced by the time it’s discovered.\r\n\r\nPancreatitis: The pancreas becomes inflamed and damaged by its own digestive chemicals. Swelling and death of tissue of the pancreas can result. Although alcohol or gallstones can contribute, sometimes a cause for pancreatitis is never found.\r\nPancreatic pseudocyst: After a bout of pancreatitis, a fluid-filled cavity called a pseudocyst can form. Pseudocysts may resolve spontaneously, or they may need surgical drainage.\r\nIslet cell tumor: The hormone-producing cells of the pancreas multiply abnormally, creating a benign or cancerous tumor.  These tumors produce excess amounts of hormones and then release them into the blood. Gastrinomas, glucagonomas, and insulinomas are examples of islet cell tumors.\r\n\r\nEnlarged pancreas: An enlarged pancreas may mean nothing. You may simply have a pancreas that is larger than normal. Or, it can be because of an anatomic abnormality. But other causes of an enlarged pancreas may exist and require treatment.\r\n    \r\n          Pancreas Tests\r\n\r\nPhysical examination: By pressing on the center of the belly, a doctor might check for a mass in the pancreas. He or she can also look for other signs of pancreas conditions.\r\nComputed tomography scan: A CT scanner takes multiple X-rays, and a computer creates detailed images of the pancreas and abdomen. Contrast dye may be injected into your veins to improve the images.\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Magnetic waves create highly detailed images of the abdomen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an MRI that focuses on the pancreas, liver, and bile system.\r\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): Using a camera on a flexible tube advanced from the mouth to the intestine, a doctor can access the area of the pancreas head. Tiny surgical tools can be used to diagnose and treat some pancreas conditions.\r\nPancreas biopsy: Either using a needle through the skin or a surgical procedure, a small piece of pancreas tissue is removed to look for cancer or other conditions.\r\nUltrasound: A probe is placed on the belly, and harmless sound waves create images by reflecting off the pancreas and other organs.\r\nAmylase and lipase: Blood tests showing elevated levels of these pancreatic enzymes can suggest pancreatitis.\r\nSweat chloride test: A painless electric current stimulates the skin to sweat, and the chloride in perspiration is measured. People with cystic fibrosis often have high sweat chloride levels.\r\nGenetic testing: Many different mutations of a single gene can cause cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing can help identify if an adult is an unaffected carrier or if a child will develop cystic fibrosis.\r\n   \r\n       Pancreas Treatments;\r\nInsulin  Injection\r\nPseudocyst drainage\r\nPseudocyst surgery\r\npancreatic cancer\r\nPancreatic enzymes\r\nPancreas transplantation",

You spend money gladly because you're not ambushed at every turn. Games are for entertainment, sure you need to make your money. But give people a great game and they will come. All in all, a great game. And best of all, totally offline if you so desire. So while other online games are waiting for an internet connection this one is being played.",

            "The game is superb but the problem the guns are so costly and many of the guns should be brought in eagle, like gold but the levels and the boss are superb .l like the game but not eagles they should give more eagles at least 2 for a mission.but there should be same like this one more game. Which should have 10000000 of levels😊",
            "Awesome game. HOW TO CHEAT TIME IN GAME FOR WEAP UPGRADES FREE BASIC CRATES.turn off all data wifi included. (this game looks for network time. if it cant find it uses internet time). turn off auto clock in settings. upgrade for uzi time 59 min turns to time countdown in thousands. move your date ahead of what the new countdown is. usually 4 days ahead to be on safe side. go back into game weapons. you will hear reload. voilá..BASIC CRATES MOVE DATE AHEAD +5 OR MORE😁😁😁"

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

The controls are TERRIBLE, and the game keeps crashing and won't open back up. I really like this game but its very frustarting to play with these issues. Please fix this !",
            "Its an amazing game, but there are some lags, like stars dissapearing after I close the game, and some crashes and freezes, but I love the game. Highly recommended! Edit: So I uninstalled the game for more space, and when I was done I installed it again, but even though I logged in with both Google Play Games and Facebook, my data was lost. So until this problem is fixed, I'm rating it 3 stars.",
            "Great graphics, controls, and game play. But like a lot of other people I think it's needs a plot of some kind because we need more than just some little quests. I also want you to add the state of Nevada as a location. And please make it easier to get sheriff stars or at least lower the prices. Overall great game but I think you can make it greater. If you do add a plot try to make it about the player that's trying to take down a antagonist who's trying to spread darkness throughout the West.",
            "Awful, glitches all the time, wont let me do multiplayer, saying I'm not connected to Internet, randomly closes, and worst of all I'm stuck in one position, can't move at all, its really bad considering how big gameloft is, don't waste your time on this garbage",
            "The last time I played this game was when I was little. I came back to download the game, and I cant open it. I had to check the last time it was made, and it was JANUARY. Please update your game. It seems that Gameloft just cares about asphalt, which is a good game but you have a lot of other games that are a fail due to laziness."

The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”<br>Shahin Tabatabaei, MD<br>Mass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School<br><br>“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”<br>Andrew S. Lenhardt, MD <br>Lahey Clinic, Hamilton, MA",

            "Game features are really good and detailed. The more I play, the more features I get to discover. Joining alliance and battling with others felt the most innovative and interesting, not to mention making friends and allies just as your game character. There are different means to earn golds too which is rare. There was a huge glitch problem which wasn't allowing me to play for more than a minute or two, but thanks to the developers, it's now solved fully and I can play freely and smoothly.",
            "Really fun game! Different from how it was advertised though, but it's ok. I've been playing for around 157days, and I've been active daily. Many people commented that it's a game that requires money to achieve high ranks, but that's not really true. As long as u put ur resources in the right places, n during events, u'll be able to rank well! Like within the top 100. It's fun to challenge myself n c how high a rank I can go without paying a single cent. :) It's nice to chat with other players!",
            "Money-hungry. Servers die less than a year. I like this game because I met a lot of people and able to be friends with. I do still enjoy this game. The issue is that it really, really, really is a pay-to-win. CME will milk everything they have to offer. They even tweaked the algorithm to give out fewer shards during events. Emperor shards are even more difficult now to get. I have four decent VIP accounts (unlocked all quick buttons) on different servers. Is it worth your money? Definitely not.",
            "Just had the new update and it's disappointing tbh. I get that the game needs to come up with ways to make money so that it can keep giving out great content but can CME at least not make the events even more difficult than they already are. It's true that if you play regularly you will be rewarded but it's tiring and now I'm kind of fed up. Before update I could at least play my favourite Jade for Beauty with ease but now it's a CS event and I've got to be here at all hours to keep up rank.",
            "The new art academy to get a superheroine is a joke. You can't call that a game! I don't have a problem with the cost (even though it's absurdly expensive, it takes $500-$2,000 real money to get a superheroine). My problem is how completely boring it is to \"play\" that art academy \"game\" It just spams world chat with notifications from other players. No one in our cross servers likes the game. Reaction was 1/10, everyone hates it. Who approved of this dumb idea? We need more actual FUN mini games"

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

I should be able to delete my stuff. It is my stuff to delete if I want to. Played both versions and it is not so friendly to f2p. I mean I thought it to be a real RTS but not nearly close.",
            "Too many potty mouth kids INSULTING each other and PLAYERS without any reaction from developers on report. Stopped playing, uninstalled. It's basically like any other PAY game. The more MONEY you spend, the more you can HARASS others. Not the most elaborate strategic war games I've seen but its ok. Gets a little boring with all the waiting around. Horny sounding and looking animated girls narrate the game progress. Whatever floats one's boat...",
            "It's a good game. But still needs some adjustments. Like, it unecessarily cuts my 1500 game golds in the name of HQ transportation, when I tried to transport it to a nearest place of my guild member. After deducting the above amount, it simply says it cannot be done due to some kind of boundries. I mean, which type of game is this when I am unable to help my team members, couldn't arrange a rally or be a part of it? Seriously, a lot more work is required to improve this game.",

            "This is Kiss of War with Zombies. That's it. As far as I can tell, there are very minor differences, such as you can't choose the United Kingdom, Helena isn't available in the beginning, and Pandora is now Chimera (though a lot of the spoken dialogue still references Pandora). Really lazy re-skin, but that music makes all of the difference. Stick with KoW is you've put any significant time in it, otherwise play this for the awesome music. Oh, and zombies!"

            "10/12/20 - This app used to work great, then Android 11 came. I am using a Pixel 2 device that otherwise works with everything. The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",
            "This app has been amazing for 10 years straight! I can't believe it's been that long. Dear developer of this app, thank you for your attention to simplicity, detail and simply having the courage to not bloat this app over time! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",

        "description": "Use this app to learn about the symptoms of HIV and more about the virus\r\n\r\nWhat is HIV?\r\n\r\nHIV is a virus that damages the immune system. The immune system helps the body fight off infections. Untreated HIV infects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cells. Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of infections and cancers. \r\n\r\nHIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:\r\n\r\n    blood\r\n    semen\r\n    vaginal and rectal fluids\r\n    breast milk\r\n\r\nThe virus doesn’t spread in air or water, or through casual contact.\r\n\r\nStages of HIV\r\n\r\n    stage 1: acute stage, the first few weeks after transmission\r\n    stage 2: clinical latency, or chronic stage\r\n    stage 3: AIDS\r\n\r\nHIV is a lifelong condition and currently there is no cure, although many scientists are working to find one. However, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.\r\n\r\nWithout treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called AIDS. At that point, the immune system is too weak to fight off other diseases and infections. Untreated, life expectancy with AIDS is about three years Trusted Source. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-controlled and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.\r\n\r\nIt’s estimated that 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 5 don’t know they have the virus.\r\n\r\nBelow are the top 20 countries with people living with Hiv\r\n\r\nSwaziland\r\nLesotho\r\nBotswana\r\nSouth Africa\r\nNamibia\r\nZimbabwe\r\nZambia\r\nMozambique\r\nMalawi\r\nUganda\r\nEquatorial Guinea\r\nKenya\r\nTanzania\r\nCentral African Republic\r\nCameroon\r\nGabon\r\nBahamas, \r\nThe\tCongo, \r\nRepublic of the Guinea-Bissau\r\nRwanda\r\n\r\nHIV can cause changes throughout the body. Learn about the effects of HIV on the different systems in the body.\r\n\r\n What is AIDS?\r\n\r\nAIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean they’ll develop AIDS.\r\n\r\nHIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below 200 per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.\r\n\r\nA person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an opportunistic infection or cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV. An opportunistic infection, such as pneumonia, is one that takes advantage of a unique situation, such as HIV.\r\n\r\nUntreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about three years Trusted Source. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing.\r\n\r\nIf AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised. It’s weakened to the point where it can no longer fight off most diseases and infections. That makes the person vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including:\r\n\r\n    pneumonia\r\n    tuberculosis\r\n    oral thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth or throat\r\n    cytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus\r\n    cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection in the brain\r\n    toxoplasmosis, a brain infection caused by a parasite\r\n    cryptosporidiosis, an infection caused by an intestinal parasite\r\n    cancer, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma\r\n\r\nThe shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it’s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS.

Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

But I beleave the developers cannot make anither farming simulator that can match Farm track 14. Can I get the company e-mail address?",

            "It's a fantastic game, and I'm very addicted to it. It's a great introduction to FS, and it's sold me on buying the sequels. But! This version is so old that there are a number of bugs that mean it's not suitable for new hardware. In the version I have, seeds and fuel never run out. Also, sometimes a section of your field turns a different colour and won't turn back. If GIANTS continue to offer this game for new devices on the app store, they need to clean it up and make it work correctly.",
            "This is very best game of farming but some problem in this game the some tractor are not unlock they are uinlock with rral money of high rate so u increase the rate of tractor but not unlock with real money. I like handle in game in game setting the handle is not aavible before the handle is avalible.so u change the setting.",

Great watch but not a very proficient app.",

So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "I like the simple gameplay, and collecting my favorite wrestlers. But when it comes to getting more and making them stronger, unless you're rich, it's going to take a long time. The rewards for events suck, everything is expensive, Scopely HATES giving away free stuff, the prizes are always the minimum amount awarded, and often what you DON'T need. I started when it was new and rewarded well, now it's an exercise in disappointment. Unless you're a fan, don't bother, even then be cautious. 😡",
            "If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I've been playing for a few years now so, im invested. But, if you're reading this and you havent installed yet...dont. Scopely took a very entertaining game and turned into a giant cash grab. Unless you're prepared to open up your wallet and just give them everything in it you have 0 chance to be even competitive anymore. Screw getting ahead unless you fork over hundreds of $ forget about even seeing the same level as the average player.",
            "STAY AWAY!!!! unless you enjoy being screwed over time and time again, then go ahead and download and play it. Been playing pretty much since the game launched, there are toooo many bugs that they refuse to fix, they will rollback rewards as they see fit, most events will launch with issues and be taken down to be \"investigated\".... just not worth it",
            "The overall user experience is a nightmare. While there are some fun aspects to the game in terms of roster building and movesets, nothing comes close to the way the player is treated like absolute garbage by this company. On a weekly if not daily basis, there are messed up rewards that are shrugged off with the poorest possible apology and no recompense. If you are thinking about trying this game, don't.",
            "Good game... if you are one who needs to be the best on free cellphone games you're going to spend... key word (free) just keep it simple and enjoy. If you want to make developers rich then spend. It's a choice, they are not holding you hostage. That goes for any free cellphone game people download and complain about spending. WWE Champions is ... AWESOME!"

            "Great game, lots of fun. Just like Game of war, mobile strike, and all the other games like this though. Fully pay to win. People spend hundreds of dollars a day and then a handful of whales makes all the kingdom rules and do whatever they want. You can spend thousands of dollars and then wait a month or 2 and be obsolete. Unless you can afford dropping 10-20k in the next year, find another game. F2p will dump thousands of hours into this game only to be dominated and crushed by bullies.",
            "Leave this one alone. 2 years into game. Most expensive game ever. It's just to expensive. Ive put a few 1000 $$$$. In the last month alone around $800 into this game and cannot compete. The developers are money gouging. The game has no enjoyment any more. If you do not spend big you will not thrive. And the cost of healing troops is phenomenal. Do not attack or let others attack you, it will send you broke. Dominated by Asian players.",
            "Decided to download after seeing hundreds of this game's ads, and instantly became addicted. This game is easy to pick up and hard to put down because of the fact that, unlike similar titles like Clash of Clans, this game constantly gives you a feeling of accomplishment and progress through everything you do. Rarely is progress slow either, it's a steady climb of power from the moment you start. Also, people in alliances ACTUALLY help eachother grow and everyone can contribute. 10/10.",
            "I love this game. Much more involved as far as team work goes. That's what I like most. THAT, was two years ago. Now whales have taken the game. If you are not willing to spend time (like 2years) playing mostly if not free. Then stay away! There are actual people here who have spent over 10k USD just to be huge. You don't own the game. They can pull the plug any time they choose. And you gain nothing. I am quitting after playing a loyal and honest game. Those qualities will get you nowhere.",
            "The game is good but some little things can be added to make it better. Also alliance members should be allowed an option to give arrows of resistance. it takes to long to get to the last age. And it should be easier to get legendary commanders like Richard the 1st. They need to work more on the game. It should not take 1 year to get to 10 million power, this game out last your device. It should only take 2 months to get to 5 mill not 9 months. Also your verification system is very annoying. 👍"

The meditate function is so cool. The off world mechanics to level up are totally cool. Take advantage of off world. Love this game.",

Also make sure you have decent spells",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

Many cancers and the abnormal cells that compose the cancer tissue are further identified by the name of the tissue that the abnormal cells originated from (for example, breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer).\r\n\r\n Cancer is not confined to humans; animals and other living organisms can get cancer. Below is a schematic that shows normal cell division and how when a cell is damaged or altered without repair to its system, the cell usually dies. Also shown is what occurs when such damaged or unrepaired cells do not die and become cancer cells and show uncontrolled division and growth -- a mass of cancer cells develop.\r\n\r\n Frequently, cancer cells can break away from this original mass of cells, travel through the blood and lymph systems, and lodge in other organs where they can again repeat the uncontrolled growth cycle. This process of cancer cells leaving an area and growing in another body area is termed metastatic spread or metastasis. For example, if breast cancer cells spread to a bone, it means that the individual has metastatic breast cancer to bone.

            "Where did the other drag racing go? This version is a lot worse than the original 2014 club wars. I hope in the future Creative Mobile comes up with a game like 2014 club wars. The game image looks cool but the game itself is ugly and I hate how you have to earn so called \"tokens\" just to unlock a stupid car. Horrible.",
            "Slight improvement....but still has pesky bugs(can't update car stats,friends races go blank,pro league still closed even after promising big September update,save game only working now,ad pop ups disrupting testing cars tunes & game continuity,event classic & 4x4 allows non lvl cars to enter resulting in miscalculating of points system,car sounds still unrealistic....plse fix before everyone starts uninstalling this once great game.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "Awesome game , but i do think that new cars should be add n create it abit more challenging, with easier options in getting rp with out purchasing n doing online races Been playing this game for 5years Would really like to see different brands n more competition",
            "I loved this game when i first played it but now its not the same. Like the gallardo i used to use alot now it cost tokens. Also lag etc.. But change that you need tokens to upgrade 3 tier upgrades on cars that you bought with tokens. But overall amazing game."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "It's agood for kids app, fun to play. But I want to report a complain here, that is, about advertisements. It's okay to advertise, but my problem is what type you are providing. Once my sister was playing and suddenly she got to see an add with an almost naked person. It's disturbing to see such things especially on a kids app. Please, the developers should look forward to it. Thanks.",
            "Very cool! I personally think that the outfits are very cool and stylish. The graphics and audio are also very adorable and cute. My 2 year old sister is very joyful about this application. Please add more updates and try to fix some bugs. Keep up the good work and never stop until you feel happy and pleased with your game. You're very amazing to help us with stress. I love taking care of Tom!",
            "I wanted to install the game again and immediately installed it... I used to love this game and now there afe THREE packages you can click to earn something by watching an ad and normally I don't mind that but they won't go away. They follow you in every room and it annoys me so much that the fun of decorating is taken by that... So no, not again... Pretty sad",
            "Never pass this game. All the comments about this were wrong. They don't know how to play and always loose so they give all of you a bad review. This is my suggestion do not leave this game. I was always on this game when ever i have time. You all would like it. And it's birthday's come very fast ❗❗❗❗and it level up also very faster. I love this game. There are some rumors about this game but they sre not true, when speaking of Talking Angela the things are true. I saw something in her eye. 🤗🤗",
            "I played this game since I was 3 years old my brother gave the suggestion of this game and I only not love this game but all your games and also your to see your videos . Now too I love to play this game now I am 10 years old. But please add more mini games.😺"

The characters are expensive and the guns are also expensive you can, you spin paying only cash but you don't get alot cash and you also don't get cash for killing zombies and completing missions I think you only get when you purchase it when level up. Guys I think you add something in the new update of this game to allow us to earn cash more easily. This is a good game it's just hard and I recommend it hope y'all enjoy",
            "I like this game but its player doesn't have more health to survive . One cut zombie almost 10 percent of health goes down if must be improved. And its item guns needs too much money to get purchased it should be improved they need to low the price . But it is a interesting game 😡",

            "Great fun game but I dont have any other maps...its stuck at saying coming soon. Also I'm maxed out at the last worm level 66 and the campaign+ is stuck at level 19 because my worm level is too low. Is this because I'm playing the free version?",
            "Action packed and fun game. It is the best free game out there in my opinion.",
            "Such a very good game but you don't have more worms and maps",
            "I haven't played yet, but I'm so happy to see this here, even if it doesn't quite live up to the original, it's still nice to see something from my childhood being brought back, regardless of how the game plays, I appreciate all that put in the effort to bring this back, it really is a blast from the past, and I'm all for it! Let's just hope it can at least come close to the OG!!!"

            "Part1. Game play is too fake. The whole idea is to generate money by making the pre-fold best hand lose so the players keeps buying chips to continue playing. No doubt about it. Nobody should download this game. You will lost all your chips on the river card. Just make sure play with only free money. Don't buy chips. Worst ever game!!!!!! I noticed that they will only reply on good reviews and only technical feedback. Never have they commented how is suck. How much money does this game make?",
            "The game itself is good. However for those who play frequently the winning chance are almost 0.01%. Although they said the 'algorithm' is fair. It is not true. If you have a winning streak for example there would be a time where you will be losing your money, thus it will pushes the player to buy chips using your own money. Its a not good game. For a player like me don't like to spent too much money on game that doesn't rewards us of anything.",
            "Like all the others, it sucks you in fast and then you have to pay to compete. They give you a lot of free chips for a couple days and then you need to buy chips to complete because the adds don't even cover one buy in and the bonuses slow down to almost non existent. No long term, top, player in this game exist without consistent in game purchases. Why can't we just play a poker game without pretending to be billionaires? Just play poker and watch an ad here and there if needed. Greed",
            "Put simply with the new greedy higher Zynga take / rake portion for sit and go's and cash games even if you're a winning player you lose your chips -> pointless. This along with the even worse than before fake predetermined scenarios sent out instead of actual real card distribution is the last straw. How often is it straight over 2 pair, flush over straight, full house over flush. Too many times to be possible in real cards! Fake! NOT random cards. Devs say that these predetermined scenarios are randomly handed out to players to get their crappy certification but it's not random cards and the fake set-ups just get more obvious and annoying the more you play and this aspect like other recent changes seems to have been also tweaked for the worse. I'm out. Used to be an ok experience but not anymore. Closed my account. I imagine that they are losing users in general. I don't miss it.",
            "Rubbish, a con, you play hands where you have the winning hand to be beaten on last card by a hand statistically your unlikely to get, I played over 200 hands with no winning hand. Its a game full of bots to then make you purchase chips, when you spend money on this game you lose more chips, it's a joke. Also when you make purchases you see there is say 5millionin the pot, you win it and only get credited 4.2million its not right at all. You only notice it on larger tables. This game is rigged t"

Good luck choosing my custom colors again. I just finished, definitely no interest in going back to the halfway point. Also, most of the pages shown are not available unless you spend money. I suppose they have to make money somehow, but they should separate the pages available from the ones you need to upgrade in order to fully access. Otherwise fun.",

            "I've been using this app for a couple months. I think there's a problem with the automatic date it puts on the title line within each note. Today, 10-05-2020 (Oct.05,2020), I noticed my note had the date 10-25-20, so I tapped that date and changed it do the date (09-25-2020) that appears When I close the editing of the active note. But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",
            "This app sucks it keeps stopping I have a lot of information on this app that I thought I could retrieve at any time now when I hit the app it just says the app has stopped,and do I want to close app or send a message which I am doing ,this app was working great until recent it just won't opem. I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",
            "Buggy.. obviously poorly tested. Would give it zero stars if it were possible.",
            "it does what it's suppose to do no frills no fancy stuff ,I was looking for something I could just write something on real quick notepad does that...I only gave notepad 4 stars because when I first go to notepad to use it there's ad that pops up every time ,,I just hit go back button the notepad is there for me to start writing tommy g So,Cal,",
            "It is a sketchy app. The devs comment and say the permissions you give for them to access your contacts and phone records are for better functionality. However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb. The only way that adds up is if it is recording your calls. Supposedly, it filters spam, but I only got a potential spam notice once. Report the app for theft"

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "I don't understand what's the complaint regarding some colours needed to pay $. Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enough🤔🙄🤬😤🧐🙃😒😠👎👈",
            "Even though I know it costs alot of money for myself its worth every penny! Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off 🤔 And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself 😊 Jackie"

            "It wasn't designed to do phone calls. Amazing how the decoder can automatically select format. Creates interesting effects when the encoder is played through an amplifier. Would like to try this in a large reverberation sized room. Working best when at lower volume not loud enough to bounce off of walls. Scottie DX is actually the only mode that doesn't smear my profile picture. I've got this encoder and decoder set on 3 of my devices. I've sent my profile picture to myself through every single mode this pair can do. Looking forward to the day I can actually use them with a radio or even home phone.",
            "I love this app, but I've had a slight problem this last time I've installed it... For some reason the save button is greyed out, and the share button doesn't seem to do anything. Is there any reason this would be happening that I'm just missing? I had to save my last image via screenshot, which isn't ideal, so I'd rather be able to use the default save feature :) I'm on Android 10 on a Nokia 7.1 Thanks for the great app!"

It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",

The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",

A GOOD GAME!",

In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",

Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "Dino rampage is an amazing game. It has lovely features. Very nice game. It working very well. I like it very much",
            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",
            "this is a very enjoyable and mind blowing came city dinosaur is extremely good one of the best and very amazing game for entertainment.",

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

            "It's and ok game, I just wish there were more mini games and the different areas for animals should be such high levels to get. Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "I really enjoyed this app it's actually really cool! Now that it was Holloween I tried it... Yes it is neat. The only issue is that you can use the app just to see if you like it and it will give you a lot of options but I didn't like that if you didn't purchase this app... You get cut off and you cut off your potential customers to early I understand that you're goal is to make money off your app.Im not sure about the purchase I don't know what more it has to offer just get cut off .",
            "When signing up for monthly pro, the app tells you your first 3 days are free and \"at the end of the 3 day trial period an auto-renewable subscription will be activated automatically.\" This is a lie! There is no free trial; you will be charged immediately! Luckily I disputed the charges with Google and got my money back, but beware y'all, there is no free trial, regardless of what my screenshot of the app clearly says.",
            "This is an awesome app! There are two paid option that are reasonable and so worth it. With so many cool options and features that are available to try for free you will definitely stay busy and will want to the paid version and the more you share the smarter the app gets so you can't go wrong. I Definitely recommend this app.",
            "Luv 💗. I use this app all the time. I love it. The only thing id say it needs to improve on is the fact that there are not many options that work for group photos. Most onky work for selfies",
            "I dropped off the one star and reduced it to zero. The devs responded about getting the 1 year option and everything was wrong. Here's what you have to do: cancel your subscription and wait for a little bit. You will then have MANY places where they nag you to go PRO and from there you can choose either subscription option. You cannot do like the dev said. This is sure a lot more trouble than it's worth. UNINSTALLED! ---ORIGINAL review: I'm giving this ONE star because of their business model. Like other's, the first thing I saw was an offer of 3 day free trial with $4.99 PER MONTH after, plus another offer (that I can no longer find) for $9.99 per year. I might go for the yearly option except for the fact that everything they do seems shady. There are NO options and that includes no way within the app to tell it not to send notifications. I immediately was targeted with a notification and after a few of those, I had to go into the phone's notification settings to block them. They constantly nag me to share my pictures on their web site so they can have free use of my creations which they make it VERY difficult to remove what you shared and changed your mind. The online website provides NO options to delete your shares. Somewhere, I saw a recommendation for this app but it didn't give a clue about how expensive it was (even on the App Store, there is little to warn you). You find this out right away when you first run it. Positive note: the app itself is very fun and very addictive. It's all internet based functions, very little is actually on the phone taking up your memory. If you have weak internet or poor signal, this will be frustrating slow. If I can't find the overpriced $9.99 per year option, I'm not continuing this grossly overpriced monthly subscription. It's fun, but not THAT fun. With the lack of information and options, I am suspect of this company's motives. There is so much wrong with this company and it's functions it's kind of scary."

            "Honestly one of the best fps games in the play store that I've played. Love the weapons, the graphics, and the overall feel of the game. The ability to backup/restore really comes in handy for moving to new devices, or even if you just want to delete the app for a while when you're low on storage. Wish there was an online multiplayer, however the lack of that is not enough to rate this any lower than 5 stars. Great game overall.",
            "It's a good game but it's missing some important things like customizable control and auto shoot if possible but most importantly customizable controls, it is really hard to aim and shoot at the same time with thumb only if we could get multiple finger support for example allow us to shoot in right and left both side so with right finger I can aim and with left I can hold it down to shoot, I hope we'll get it soon 😁 great game.",
            "It is a best app to play like free fire Advantages: *good graphics *good gun collection *good creations *good game for fighting the zombie *we can play both offline&online Disadvantage : *THere is no jumping key. So this is the only disadvantage for mee. This zombie shooting game is very interesting to play. So everyone try this game.",
            "One of the best zombie games on mobile. But, as always, half the guns can only be attained with 'Gold'. Meaning, practically impossible to attain. So, basically need to pay real money to attain, or watch tonnes of ads to play casino for a chance to get a few gold at a time. Dead Trigger 2 is no more generous either.",
            "The game is really good with graphics, Here is the bad of it.. -First the Aim side is in same side with the shooting button, thus very difficulty to manage both. -Second you have made the prices of weapons to be very high in such a way that no body can afford. -Third, knowing that we can't afford weapons, you have made the missions to be very hard really it's boring. -Fourth,at least you could design a place to hide,zombies are coming in all directions as rain and you find youself in the middle."

            "For being one of the largest television providers, your app is hot garbage. Not easy to navigate or find what you're looking for. But the DVR functionality is the worst. The whole point of the app is to be able to watch what I pay for on the go, and be able to access my DVR. The app syncs to my box but as soon as I leave my wifi I can no longer access my DVR shows. Fix this immediately!",
            "1. Difficulty logging on! 2. While watching a TV program. A commercial comes on. After the commercial the program puts me back to the beginning of the show. Then you have to toggle and try to find where you were. If you don't hit the right spot you go to another commercial and you have to wait again or go back to the beginning of the program. 3. The toggle to forward or reverse your position in a TV show is very sensitive and hard to use. I'm very surprised at DirecTV with such a sloppy program.",
            "Absolutely the worst app ever. Every show I try to watch restarts from the beginning after the first set on endless commercials. When I try to return to where I left off, the app either freezes, starts fast forwarding, plays picture with no sound, or sound with no picture. Rediculous! And I'm only giving 1 star because you're forcing me to before letting me post.",
            "I suppose it works to watch stuff On Demand if you missed something yesterday, same thing you can do on a computer. But, I don't comprehend how this app, for years, still has some sort of problem when watching your own DVR. It fails all the time. Today, I download an episode of a show. It finishes within 10 minutes. I open up my Downloads, it's not there. I download it again, the 10 minutes pass, again, and then it's finally marked as downloaded and ready. And yet. I click play, and it crashes.",
            "Does a lot of buffering even when connected to wifi. Drives me nuts that it doesn't keep track of where I am in previously watched shows. Then if I try to skip forward to find where I left off, I have to sit through 3 mins of commercials. No matter if I skip forward 20 mins or 2 mins. Again, this could be avoided if the app did a better job of tracking previously watched shows."

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

That's right, the better the fuel, the better the brain will work.\r\nConversely, unhealthy food decreases brain productivity, but proper nutrition increases the ability to concentrate and be more efficient.\r\nIn today's world, some people have a very fast pace of life, so it is common to resort to prepared and packaged foods and eat them on the fly.\r\nThis causes a big problem even if at first they do not see it, since industrially processed foods are made to make people eat more excesses than they should not.\r\nIt sounds exaggerated but at some point it creates a certain addiction. On the other hand, healthy eating helps you to awaken your gustatory system and to delight yourself with more different and natural flavors. Enjoying the benefits of a healthy diet without exceptions.\r\nIf what you eat on a daily basis contains many simple carbohydrates, your blood sugar level will skyrocket.\r\nExcess sugar is dangerous for your body, because it starts releasing large amounts of insulin. This substance transports the sugar molecules from your bloodstream to the cells, so your blood glucose level drops and your body asks for more sugar. This starts a vicious circle in which the body constantly releases insulin and increases drowsiness.\r\nA balanced lunch composed of complex carbohydrates, vegetables and proteins will help you get your energy level high.\r\nWith my anti-cancer recipes you will learn to eat healthy, to balance your body and mind. If your body gets everything it needs, it will make you notice it.\r\nEating well not only reduces mood swings, some foods can even help your body reduce the segregation of the stress hormone and cortisol. This way you will feel more balanced, more fit, healthier and live to the fullest.\r\nAlways keep in mind that a healthy diet today is a healthy body tomorrow.\r\nLiving a healthy life strengthens the organism, so you will be more protected from the first cause of mortality in contemporary society.\r\nThis means that in the long term it reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, heart disease or heart attacks, cancer, diabetes and other diseases.\r\nBut if you eat badly, you will be more exposed to suffer one of the diseases mentioned above. Eat healthy, bet for your quality of life and also for your health in the future.\r\nAnd you? What are you waiting for to start a healthy lifestyle and enjoy all these benefits? Remember that you only have one body and one life.\r\n\r\n Discover all the healthy and healthy options that the app offers my anti-cancer recipes!\r\n\r\nThanks for trusting us!!",

This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

        "title": "How To Cure Diabetes",
        "description": "What all types of diabetes have in common is that they cause people to have too much glucose (sugar) in their blood. But we all need some glucose. It’s what gives us our energy. We get glucose when our bodies break down the carbohydrates that we eat or drink.

With all of the information about heart disease on both TV and the Internet, do you really know which information is advice that you can trust on heart disease? How about information that is not accurate on heart disease?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many different kinds of “heart disease” and we will briefly touch on those in this article, as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you ready to learn more about what heart disease is and the different types of heart disease? Good, then keep reading!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Heart Disease?\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is heart disease? The latest definition of heart disease is any disease that affects how the heart normally works. Narrowing or hardening of the arteries that lead to the heart is the most common type of cardiac disease, today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course this can encompass quite a few types or variations of heart disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious types of heart disease include:\r\n\r\n* Alcoholic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Aortic regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Aortic stenosis\r\n\r\n* Arrhythmias\r\n\r\n* Cardiogenic shock\r\n\r\n* Congenital heart disease\r\n\r\n* Coronary artery disease (CAD)\r\n\r\n* Dilated cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Endocarditis\r\n\r\n* Heart attack (myocardial infarction)\r\n\r\n* Heart failure\r\n\r\n* Heart tumor\r\n\r\n* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Idiopathic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Ischemic cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Acute mitral regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Chronic mitral regurgitation\r\n\r\n* Mitral stenosis\r\n\r\n* Mitral valve prolapse\r\n\r\n* Peripartum cardiomyopathy\r\n\r\n* Pulmonary stenosis\r\n\r\n* Stable angina\r\n\r\n* Unstable angina\r\n\r\n* Tricuspid regurgitation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are many categories of what actually constitutes heart disease. Now that we have identified different types of cardiac disease, let’s explore some of the underlying causes of these diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses Of Heart Disease\r\n\r\nJust as many different names for cardiac disease can be confusing and complicated, so can the causes of heart disease. And we will cover the most common causes below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBriefly, here are some causes:\r\n\r\n* Hypertension (“high blood pressure”)\r\n\r\n* Heart valves that do not function normally\r\n\r\n* Electrical conduction of the heart that causes an abnormal rhythm.\r\n\r\n* Heart’s pumping function that is affected by toxins or infections.\r\n\r\n* Congenital or “birth defects” of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many People Are Affected By Heart Disease?\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Institute of Health, there are approximately 70.1 million people affected by some type of cardiac disorder! Heart disease continues to be the number one cause of death in the US.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong minorities, cardiac disease or heart disease, ranks first as leading cause of death. The rates of deaths declined for those groups with the exception of one group, American Indian females. The time frame for this study was between 1985 and 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween 1992 and 2002, the percentage of decline of death rates for CHD (Cardiac Heart Diseas) was the highest among white males and the least decline was in the black female population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Impact Of Cardiac Heart Disease\r\n\r\nBesides the horrific costs of CHD in terms of personal tragedy, society also bears the brunt of the effects of this disease. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the study, 2005 costs for CVD(Cardiovascular Disease) were staggering. Overall, costing 393 Billion Dollars!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCosts broke down like this:\r\n\r\n* 242 Billion Dollars for direct health care costs.\r\n\r\n* 35 Billion Dollars for indirect costs of morbidity.\r\n\r\n* 117 Billion Dollars in DIRECT costs of mortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, cardiovascular disease is one that while complicated and intricate in name and causes, is simply devastating to both the individual and to the society that the affected comes from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be taken very seriously and not ignored, so education and prevention are essential in decreasing the effects of these diseases, commonly know as cardiac disease.",

For me the aiming part of the game is too difficult to use as compared to that of Call of Duty Mobile. If you can please upgrade it and make it like that of COD mobile, you will definitely get a 5 star from me at least",

Likewise the weapo are too expensive as well as the gold given at the end of every Adventure is too small! Please i will urge the Developers to do something before the game is been abandoned.Thanks.",

            "A convenient screen locker....I don't want it! But, it won't let me turn off that option. Every time I turn off the \"convenient\" screen locker, it reactivates on its own. When I turn it off, it displays the words \"A Convenient Screen Locker\", and it has the options \"Yes\" and \"Stay\". Either fix it right now, or I will uninstall it. There is nothing convenient about an unwanted screen locker that I don't have the option of deactivating. Are we clear on this? Update a few minutes later: You know what? This is too annoying to wait any longer. I already installed a better app that has better quality than this one. Therefore, I'm uninstalling this one. Good luck with your screen locker that can't be deactivated. See how many people will stick around for it.",
            "This app is packed full with ads - the worst I have ever seen. It even interrupts you when on other apps, like Camera, and taking pictures, to play 2 ads in a row, one of which can't be turned off for as long as 11 seconds. Even when the app has been turned off. At every step, it will play as many as 4 ads in a row before letting you go on to the next step. This means you will have to page through 4 to 8 ads total just to perform one step of a function in the app. It plays 2 ads when your clock plays a preset alarm before you can turn the alarm off. Also to turn off your phone's screen, and when you try to wake the phone up from sleep. The cleaning functions all work ok, but they are nothing special. AVOID THIS APP. It is a complete pain.",
