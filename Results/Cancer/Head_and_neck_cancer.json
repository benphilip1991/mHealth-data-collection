        "description": "he symptoms of throat cancer vary according to the location of the tumor. General signs of throat cancer may include the following:\r\n\r\nSore throat: Pain or discomfort in your throat that doesn’t go away is one of the most common symptoms of throat cancer.\r\n\r\nVoice changes: Cancer in your throat can affect your voice. Your voice might sound different. It may be quieter, husky, or sound as if you have a cold all the time. You might slur some of your words or have trouble pronouncing certain sounds.\r\n\r\nTrouble swallowing: Throat cancer can cause pain or a burning sensation when chewing and swallowing food. You might feel like food is sticking in your throat.\r\n\r\nA lump in your neck: You may have a lump in your neck caused by an enlarged lymph node. Swelling in one or more lymph nodes in the neck is a common symptom of throat cancer, as well as other head and neck cancers. Lumps that come and go are not usually due to cancer. Cancer usually forms a lump that slowly gets bigger.\r\n\r\nWeight loss: Weight loss is a common symptom of many different types of cancer. Throat cancer can make it painful to eat and difficult to swallow, which can cause weight loss.\r\nOther Signs of Throat Cancer\r\ntrouble opening your mouth\r\ntrouble moving your tongue\r\nwhite patches on your tongue or the lining of your mouth that do not go away\r\ncoughing up blood\r\nnosebleeds\r\nheadaches\r\nTypes of Throat Cancer\r\nShare\r\nPrint\r\nThe type of throat cancer you have depends on the type of cell in which the cancer began. Pathologists are able to diagnose which type of cancer you have by looking at tumor cells under a microscope.\r\n\r\nMost throat cancers are squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cells are thin, flat cells that line the throat. Carcinoma means cancer.\r\n\r\nLymphoma and cancer of the minor salivary glands can also develop in the throat. These are much more rare.\r\n\r\nThroat Cancer Doctors, Surgeons & Experts\r\nOur team of surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, and other specialists provides personalized care for people with throat cancer.\r\nLearn more\r\nWhere Throat Cancer Begins\r\nDoctors also refer to the cancer by its precise location in the throat.\r\n\r\nThe throat has two primary parts: the pharynx and the larynx.Throat cancer can begin in either place.\r\n\r\nKnowing a little bit about the anatomy of the throat will help you talk to your doctor about your treatment options for throat cancer, which may include surgery or radiation, as well as other aspects of your care.\r\n\r\nThe Pharynx\r\nThe pharynx is a thin muscular tube that’s approximately five inches long. It extends from the back of the nose and mouth to the trachea (windpipe). Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or esophagus.\r\n\r\nThe pharynx has three main sections:\r\n\r\nThe nasopharynx is the upper part of the pharynx, where the throat connects the mouth and nose.\r\nThe oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx, including the tonsils, where the throat meets the oral cavity.\r\nThe hypopharynx is the bottom part of the pharynx, where the throat meets the windpipe.\r\nThroat Cancer Causes & Risk Factors\r\nTobacco: Tobacco use includes both smoking and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco). People who are exposed to secondhand smoke are also at a greater risk for throat cancer. If you smoke or chew tobacco, you can reduce your risk of throat cancer — and the risk to those around you — by stopping now. If you’ve been diagnosed with throat cancer or are in treatment, it’s not too late to quit. Learn more about Memorial Sloan Kettering’s tobacco treatment program.\r\nAlcohol: Alcohol consumption is another major risk factor for throat cancer.\r\nBetel quid and gutka: People who chew betel quid or gutka, which is more common in parts of Asia, have an increased risk of throat cancer.",

            "First of all, there are just so many damn ads. You have to see a whole lot of em. Like you get an ad after every match. Secondly, there is certain network issues with some specific opponents only. I mean like it's all going good then suddenly an opponent and it gets network and they just win it, especially if you are playing a tournament. That's really frustrating.",
            "Yet another great game ruined by greed! To the Dev...you know those adverts that keep popping up? Nobody watches them, nobody clicks on them, nobody cares about them because they are irrelevant and so out of touch. Also, why are we limited to playing only 5-6 games before we have to pay money to refill? Absolute D**k move. So why don't you just make a €2.99 one off payment option and let us enjoy your god damn game!!! I'll even put money on the fact that you won't even respond to my review 🤫",
            "This game is such a pay-to-win! It comes up to three things: pay for diamonds, buy powerups, and win matches swiftly. You can be 5 scores ahead of another player and suddenly lose the match because your opponent uses their powrups to win the game in 20 seconds! You can even pay for bigger and faster characters! The game itself was so good if both players had equal abilities in every match.",
            "Greed has ruined the game, thanks developer. This game is actually fun and exciting but there are ads after every match. It's very annoying. If you love to watch ads every 1.5 minutes of game play, you need to have this game! There are countless of \"crazy special deals\" that you can purchase at \"up to 90% off\". Just so many ways that entice players to spend spend spend!",
            "The game is getting ridicules! I believe when one click search, the game should automatically put an opponent of the same level of power! Not a ridiculously super powered opponent who you don't stand a chance against! I'm not enjoying this game any more. This issue should be fixed. Here I am writing you new update. I thought you guys have take into consideration your the reviews of your users and fixed the issue which everyone is complaining about! You guys suck. big time."

Edit, I've reduced the number of stars to two, because as I got to leagues, apparently the bots can now do with 75% accuracy what you need god reactions to do. A real human can hardly return 30% of the supers. It's just annoying and there is no way to win. I hope this gets due attention and balancing.",

        "description": "Headaches happen. The good news is there are several simple things you can do to ease the pain without a trip to the doctor or drugstore. Try these tips and get to feeling better fast.\r\n\r\n1. Try a Cold Pack\r\nIf you have a migraine, place a cold pack on your forehead. Ice cubes wrapped in a towel, a bag of frozen peas, or even a cold shower may lessen the pain. Keep the compress on your head for 15 minutes, then take a break for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Use a Heating Pad or Hot Compress\r\nIf you have a tension headache, place a heating pad on your neck or the back of your head. If you have a sinus headache, hold a warm cloth to the area that hurts. A warm shower might also do the trick.\r\n3. Ease Pressure on Your Scalp or Head\r\nIf your ponytail is too tight, it could cause a headache. These \"external compression headaches\" can also be brought on by wearing a hat, headband, or even swimming goggles that are too tight. In one study, women who loosened their hair saw their headache disappear.\r\n\r\n4. Dim the Lights\r\nBright or flickering light, even from your computer screen, can cause migraine headaches. If you’re prone to them, cover your windows with blackout curtains during the day. Wear sunglasses outdoors. You might also add anti-glare screens to your computer and use daylight-spectrum fluorescent bulbs in your light fixtures.\r\n\r\n5. Try Not to Chew\r\nChewing gum can hurt not just your jaw, but your head as well. The same is true for chewing your fingernails, lips, the inside or your cheeks, or handy objects like pens. Avoid crunchy and sticky foods, and make sure you take small bites. If you grind your teeth at night, ask your dentist about a mouth guard. This may curb your early-morning headaches.\r\n\r\n6. Get Some Caffeine\r\nHave some tea, coffee, or something with a little caffeine in it. If you get it early enough, it could ease your headache pain. It can also help over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen, work better. Just don’t drink too much because caffeine withdrawal can cause its own type of headache.\r\n\r\nTOP PICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Practice Relaxation\r\nWhether it’s stretches, yoga, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation, learning how to chill out when you’re in the middle of a headache can help with the pain. You might even talk to your doctor about physical therapy if you have muscle spasms in your neck.\r\n\r\n8.Try Massage\r\nYou can do it yourself. A few minutes massaging your neck and temples can help ease a tension headache, which may result from stress.\r\n\r\n9. Take Some Ginger\r\nA small recent study found that taking ginger, in addition to regular, over-the-counter pain medicine, eased pain for people in the ER with migraines. Another found that it worked almost as well as prescription migraine medicine. You can try a supplement or maybe brew some tea.\r\n10. Take medicine in Moderation\r\nPharmacy shelves are stocked with pain relievers for all kinds of headaches. They may work, but to get the most benefit with the least risk, follow the directions on the label and these guidelines:\r\n\r\nChoose liquid over pills. Your body absorbs it faster.\r\nTake painkillers as soon as you feel pain. You’ll likely beat it with a smaller dose.\r\nIf you get sick to your stomach when you get a headache, ask your doctor what might help.\r\nAsk your doctor what to take to avoid a rebound headache -- pain that sets in after a few days of taking pain relievers.\r\nAnd be sure to talk to your doctor about what headache symptoms you should not try to treat at home.",

You'll get the privilage of the game ratcheting after each ad causing you to have to restart and hope there is not another ad following. If you like bs, this is for you! If not, you might want to skip this app! If it were'nt for all the ads, I'd give the game 5 stars.",
            "Overall the game is good, but dis game is also an ad vector, so it wont stop giving you ads after everytimw u completed a course, even worse its a 15 second ad, can you shorten the ad by removing vungle ads they suck at making ads, i would rate it 5 stars if it werent for ads, and i developed a secret technique: Just disable wifi and mobile data so it wont give you ad now i dont need to pay to remove ad mwehehehehemwehehehehe u cant stop meeeeeeeee >:)",
            "Absolutely amazing and addictive game. I love playing this, but there is one small problem. The thing is that the levels are very hard so if hutch could just make the levels a bit more easier that would be great! The controls and the gameplay is awesome. Overall I LIKE THIS!!",
            "I really like this game. Its interesting to play. But I have problem when I try to do challenges it works perfectly fine. But when connection is lost. At the end of the race it loses my 1st live and asks me to do the whole race again. Please fix it. So that I won't lose a single live. It happened to me 6th time and I lost all lives and have to pay gems to continue. Please fix it. Or I will delete this game. Thank You",
            "This game was fun at first, and I tried it again because of that, after giving it 3/5 stars. I was about to give it 4/5 stars when I reconsidered. The scam of this game is they give you difficult-to-control vehicles and make it nearly impossible to get anywhere without struggling against your machine to get upgrades. Nice work Mattel: Now everyone knows what Hot Wheels are good for. May you and your families Race Off the road, you strategically illiterate schmucks."

Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40.

Many industrial goods are made of ACM, including sealants, cement pipe, and insulation.<br><br>Four specific diseases have been associated with asbestos exposure: Asbestosis (a severe, chronic, non cancerous fibrous hardening and scarring of the lungs), mesothelioma (a cancer of the thin membranes lining the abdominal and thoracic cavities and surrounding internal organs), pleural plaque and thickening (scarring of the lining of the bladder) and lung cancer.<br><br>Mesothelioma<br>Synonyms\tMalignant mesothelioma<br>CT scan showing a left-sided mesothelioma with an enlarged mediastinal lymph node<br>Specialty\tOncology<br>Symptoms\tShortness of breath, swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, weight loss[1]<br>Complications\tFluid around the lung[1]<br>Usual onset\tGradual onset[2]<br>Causes\t~ 40 years after exposure to asbestos[3]<br>Risk factors\tGenetics, infection with simian virus 40[3]<br>Diagnostic method\tMedical imaging, examining fluid produced by cancer, tissue biopsy[2]<br>Prevention\tDecreased asbestos exposure[4]<br>Treatment\tSurgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, pleurodesis[5]<br>Prognosis\tFive-year survival ~8% (US)[6]<br>Frequency\t60,800 (affected during 2015)[7]<br>Deaths\t32,400 (2015)[8]<br><br>Contents<br>1\tSigns and symptoms<br>1.1\tPleural mesothelioma<br>1.2\tPeritoneal mesothelioma<br>1.3\tPericardial mesothelioma<br>1.4\tEnd stage mesothelioma<br>2\tCause<br>2.1\tAsbestos<br>2.1.1\tOccupational<br>2.1.2\tParaoccupational secondary exposure<br>2.1.3\tAsbestos in buildings<br>2.2\tGenetic disposition<br>2.3\tErionite<br>2.4\tOther<br>3\tPathophysiology<br>3.1\tSystemic<br>3.2\tIntracellular<br>3.3\tImmune system<br>4\tDiagnosis<br>4.1\tImaging<br>4.2\tBiopsy<br>4.3\tImmunochemistry<br>4.4\tSubtypes<br>4.5\tDifferential diagnosis<br>4.6\tStaging<br>5\tPrevention<br>6\tScreening<br>7\tTreatment<br>7.1\tSurgery<br>7.2\tRadiation<br>7.3\tChemotherapy<br>7.4\tImmunotherapy<br>7.5\tHeated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy<br>7.6\tMultimodality therapy<br>8\tPrognosis<br>9\tEpidemiology<br>9.1\tUK<br>10\tHistory<br>11\tSociety and culture<br>11.1\tNotable cases<br>11.2\tLegal issues<br>12\tResearch<br>13\tReferences<br>14\tExternal links<br><br><br><br>Disclaimer:<br>This App &quot;Mesothelioma Wikipedia - App No Official&quot; has been created as a resource for mesothelioma patients and their families.

        "description": "Breast cancer is by far the most common cancer in Ethiopia accounting for more than one out of three cancer cases in women and one out of every five in the general population. Diagnostic delays of 3-6 months are associated with advanced stage breast cancer and lower survival. Detection and treatment of cancer at an early stage improves the prospects for long-term survival. The Etege app will be a crucial tool in the fight against breast cancer, as it will enable patients to perform self-examination at home and detect the early stage symptoms of breast cancers and seek immediate medical attention, thereby increasing the chance of successful treatment.  \r\n\r\nEtege is a free healthcare app that uses an animated figure to visually instruct women on how to perform preliminary assessments on their bodies to detect potential signs indicative of early stage breast cancer. The animation is also complemented with an Amharic narration and together explain a detailed step by step walk through of where and how to search for signs of breast cancer in your body. Through these directed self-examinations, the Etege app would enable women to detect any anomalies and seek immediate medical attention from their medical provider. Furthermore, the app has a calendar feature that users can use to set up regular reminders for self-examination which will make it possible to catch the disease early on before its progression. The interface of this app is very simple and was made with the consideration of making it easy for use by the wide range of users who have varied experience using smartphone apps.

You shld've made it a website because think about it. once someone use this app they are not going to use it again its a one time thing its not like they are going to check for a breast cancer every day. An app is something that stays on your phone so i think you shldve made it a website. I am just shocked kudu ventures decided to invest like 2 million birr on this 😂like whats the bussiness plan here??",
            "They really shoukd tell you what language something is in before you install it. When everything else I readbis in English, it's a fair assumption that the app will be in English as well. FALSE ADVERTISING!!",

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

        "description": "Neck pain (or cervicalgia) is a common problem, with two-thirds of the population having neck pain at some point in their lives.\r\n\r\nNeck pain, although felt in the neck, can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, or pinching of the nerves emanating from the cervical vertebrae. Joint disruption in the neck creates bread, as does joint disruption in the upper back.\r\n\r\nThe head is supported by the lower neck and upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of the neck and head. The lower joints in the neck and those of the upper back create a supportive structure for the head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck bread.\r\n\r\nNeck pain affects about 5% of the global population as of 2010.\r\n\r\nMany people suffer from neck and shoulder pain very often. Stress, poor posture, accidents and acumulated physiological strain, can contribute to a mild tight or even full muscle spasm of the neck, shoulders and upper back. Faced with pain, we tend to turn medications or a heating pad for relief. However, there are several yoga poses that have therapeutic effects on the neck and shoulder as well.\r\n\r\nThe next time you have a pinch of pain, here are some yoga poses that will relieve all the areas surrounding your neck, and let you feel more open and less tense.\r\n\r\nTreatment of neck pain depends on the cause. For the vast majority of people, neck can be treated conservatively. Recommendations which help alleviate symptoms include heat or cold. Other common treatments could include medication, body mechanics training, ergonomic reform, and physical therapy.\r\n\r\nConservative treatment\r\n\r\nExercise plus joint mobilization and / or joint manipulation (spinal adjustment) has been found to be beneficial in both acute and chronic mechanical neck disorders. Both cervical manipulation and cervical mobilization produce similar immediate, and short-term changes; No long-term data are available.\r\n\r\nThoracic manipulation may also improve pain and function. Low level laser therapy has been shown to reduce pain after treatment in patients with chronic neck pain.\r\nMedication\r\n\r\nAnalgesics such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs are recommended for bread. Muscle relaxants are often prescribed and are known to be effective. However, it is not known whether cyclobenzaprine is effective in the treatment of acute cervical strain. Over the counter topical creams and patches may be effective for some patients.\r\n\r\nSurgery\r\nSurgery is usually not indicated for mechanical causes of neck pain. If there is a disease, the cancer may or may be necessary. Surgery is usually not indicated for \"pinched nerves\" or herniated discs unless there is spinal cord compression or pain and disability have been protracted for many months and refractory to conservative treatment such as physical therapy.\r\n\r\nDownload Neck Pain app now for FREE !!",

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

        "description": "Neck pain (or cervicalgia) is a common problem, with two-thirds of the population having neck pain at some point in their lives.\r\n\r\nNeck pain, although felt in the neck, can be caused by numerous other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to muscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, or pinching of the nerves emanating from the cervical vertebrae. Joint disruption in the neck creates bread, as does joint disruption in the upper back.\r\n\r\nThe head is supported by the lower neck and upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of the neck and head. The lower joints in the neck and those of the upper back create a supportive structure for the head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck bread.\r\n\r\nNeck pain affects about 5% of the global population as of 2010.\r\n\r\nMany people suffer from neck and shoulder pain very often. Stress, poor posture, accidents and acumulated physiological strain, can contribute to a mild tight or even full muscle spasm of the neck, shoulders and upper back. Faced with pain, we tend to turn medications or a heating pad for relief. However, there are several yoga poses that have therapeutic effects on the neck and shoulder as well.\r\n\r\nThe next time you have a pinch of pain, here are some yoga poses that will relieve all the areas surrounding your neck, and let you feel more open and less tense.\r\n\r\nTreatment of neck pain depends on the cause. For the vast majority of people, neck can be treated conservatively. Recommendations which help alleviate symptoms include heat or cold. Other common treatments could include medication, body mechanics training, ergonomic reform, and physical therapy.\r\n\r\nConservative treatment\r\n\r\nExercise plus joint mobilization and / or joint manipulation (spinal adjustment) has been found to be beneficial in both acute and chronic mechanical neck disorders. Both cervical manipulation and cervical mobilization produce similar immediate, and short-term changes; No long-term data are available.\r\n\r\nThoracic manipulation may also improve pain and function.

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

            "What happened to this game? I played it all the way back when it first released in 2015 and it's gotten worse and worse. Offline is just 1 boring game mode with no cars, ads EVERYWHERE, and a health system??? Take me back to when missions were first released instead of the dumpster fire it is now. This used to be such a fun experience and now it's a cash grab that has fallen from grace. Disgusting.",
            "This game is awesome! I LOVE ITTT I missed the old format it was much simpler to navigate but this is cool, totally should try it atleast you might like it! This game isn't for everyone but at least try to see if you like it. Best game in my opinion! :) Good job developers of this game I wish the best for everyone! Stay safe and enjoy yourself! :) <3",
            "This game was amazing. There was so much to it and i finished all the missions. Would always play this with my freinds. I uninstalled it somewhy (i dont remember) then now i was ready to play this masterpiece again. When i joined, 1st thing that happened was i lost all my progress. I was sad but i said that it's ok ill still play it. Then boom. This game was ruined. First thing i saw was that the main game is now the tournament. Then we had health bars??? What? And all the sales popped up. Why?",
            "I played this back about 5 years ago and back then this game was absolute gold, but now it's complicated trash not worth getting into. The updates ruined it definitely and this new version I feel like only a small audience enjoys. This was once one of my favorite mobile games but now it's a waste of storage space that's not worth downloading because the updates have turned this game from a simple and fun versus game into some generic carbon copy boring waste of space",
            "Look this game is good but it's so pay to win when you get around 500 trophies which really is not a lot. It's fun but then again anyone can just by the best cases over and over again and play the ones who don't. My advise is to make the same drive ahead but u can't by anything but u can earn. I will still play the game but if u do what I recommended it will be more enjoyable."

        "comments": [
            "I like this game and is good fun when I need something to do but there are things that need to be done. I think that firstly you should lower the price of coins you need to upgrade your stats because it becomes absolutely ridiculous and slow to get coins. I like it but it's also too easy. I almost always break the opposition's line on 2nd play and simply have to spin once to get a touchdown. Good game but AI needs to be harder and upgrades shouldn't cost as many coins. 👍",
            "I like this game but can you guys please update it ,first. The tilting is horrible especially with trying to get a tackle so can we please get touch controls ,second. The throwing is terrible when I throw the ball it always ends up in a interception but when the CPU throws the ball they always catch it ,third. My teammates can barely tackle the CPU at all I always have to tackle them and if I don't they get a easy touchdown. If you could fix all these things I'd love to play this game alot more",
            "I have a couple problems. 1 you can't sprint and turn at the same time and also it takes a long time to upgrade your player so your basically Forced to use microtransactions. Also your team mates are horrible so there basically ryling on you to make the tackle. Heres a couple things that would make this game good. 1 create a team. 2 being able to control your whole team in game and. 2 make 11 vs 11 football and add linebackers Defensive linemen and offensive linemen. Overall a decent game.",
            "The game could be a lot better. For instance every time I try to tackle someone the tackle button does not work.And the passing is very bad like every time I pass the ball barely gets any air getting like 1 or 2 feet.Dont install.",
            "(Galaxy S10+) Game is too buggy to play. Tilt to move, tackling and passing dont work half the time and the other half isn't enough to keep. I'd rather just do push ups during commercials or something. So 1 star for the workout I guess.."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

But I am having an issue, I once tried to login with facebook but due to connectivity issue I couldn't so I closed the game and then started again with good internet connectivity but now whenever I start the game it just keep showing please wait... and won't start the game and if I turn off the internet then game works properly and even if I have good connection but though it is continuously shows that I am offline.",
            "Its good and all but the last fight to win the zeus torso out of the three tasks i call them tast you have to do the one that it saes you have to beat the robot in 20sec but its to hard i cant upgrade my robot because i dont have enoff money to upgrade and you have to get all 15 rewards to get the torso i have 14 out of that 15",
            "Its a fun and good game. Ive been playing it for a while and I havent gotten bored of it. Good game if you're looking for something to play. Honestly a great game.",
            "So far the game is good but you need more regions like (10regions) and more parts of robots but the game is good and i cant stop playing",
            "This is a great game and was one of the first games i ever played. I think they should have extended the Career/Campaign mode though."

            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

            "Honestly one of the best fps games in the play store that I've played. Love the weapons, the graphics, and the overall feel of the game. The ability to backup/restore really comes in handy for moving to new devices, or even if you just want to delete the app for a while when you're low on storage. Wish there was an online multiplayer, however the lack of that is not enough to rate this any lower than 5 stars. Great game overall.",
            "It's a good game but it's missing some important things like customizable control and auto shoot if possible but most importantly customizable controls, it is really hard to aim and shoot at the same time with thumb only if we could get multiple finger support for example allow us to shoot in right and left both side so with right finger I can aim and with left I can hold it down to shoot, I hope we'll get it soon 😁 great game.",
            "It is a best app to play like free fire Advantages: *good graphics *good gun collection *good creations *good game for fighting the zombie *we can play both offline&online Disadvantage : *THere is no jumping key. So this is the only disadvantage for mee. This zombie shooting game is very interesting to play. So everyone try this game.",
            "One of the best zombie games on mobile. But, as always, half the guns can only be attained with 'Gold'. Meaning, practically impossible to attain. So, basically need to pay real money to attain, or watch tonnes of ads to play casino for a chance to get a few gold at a time. Dead Trigger 2 is no more generous either.",
            "The game is really good with graphics, Here is the bad of it.. -First the Aim side is in same side with the shooting button, thus very difficulty to manage both. -Second you have made the prices of weapons to be very high in such a way that no body can afford. -Third, knowing that we can't afford weapons, you have made the missions to be very hard really it's boring. -Fourth,at least you could design a place to hide,zombies are coming in all directions as rain and you find youself in the middle."

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

            "I love the game I hope you guys put alot of rangers on here like all the red rangers like Ninja storm red, dino thunder red, ninja storm and spd. I love this game and hope it gets alot of characters on it. The only thing I have problem with is core gameplay. Sometimes when I use moves they don't register I think that there should be a way to counter most things.",
            "Looks good, sounds alright (obnoxious soundtrack notwithstanding), definitely has the vibe of the show. The gameplay is interesting on paper, but after the first fifty times your taps fail because of (presumably) latency, you realize that perhaps the game is broken. Speaking of broken, fighters are built on pay to win. I know this because I paid and I won. Balancing between the fighter ranks may as well be non-existent. All in all, a frustrating time killer and nothing more.",
            "Great game. I love getting to use some of my favorite rangers and villians to fight other players. Only REAL nit-pick I have is that there's no story mode. What was the point of these different storylines being cinematic only? Or give us a gaultlet style option that we fight to the end of and earn chests, crystals, and shards. Just a thought but would make it a bit easier for non-paying players to progress almost as quickly as paying players.",
            "I love the game, (I have this on my kindle fire tablet, and Moto G7 Play, they have great accounts with lots of warriors on it!), But, THE LAG WITH THE GAME!!!!!!, PLS MAKE IT STOP, almost every other 3rd to 5th battle has lag, and then the other person can do what they want for the next 2-3 seconds (attack, taunt), NWay, can you pls try your best to make it where no one around the world has lag in this game!!!, Overall the game is amazing!!!, Could you make it to where you can merge accounts?",
            "The fight feel like they come right out of the show I love these characters and movements/combos it brings to the game and in game real time to make it even better there is megazord and they keep adding character which is even better!! Keep up the great stuff nway because I'm going to keep playing. They should bring in battleizers and a motorcycle game mode as well opens up the game for more options on things to do but other than that great game I play daily"

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players..

            "The game is quiet fun, but my first impression of the game was that it was slow. Within the first hour of playing, I got bored. An \"optional\" increase in speed (×2) could be good. People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

I first thought that it can be due to my device's ram, which is 2GB but later I found out a friends device which has this same game and ram as 6GB, while he is also facing the same issue. Please fix this.....",
            "I like the game, it has good graphics.but the things u should work on is the controls, because it is weak,when hitting your opponent the wrestler already smack u down.and another thing is there should be a commentator, during the fight.it's a good game in gameplay, but need to be upgraded.and the wrestler's are not real, no real names,no undertaker,or Justina..so poor.☹️☹️",
            "This game is rigged, everything is working against you. I'm giving it a second star because I'm actually enjoying the game. The stats of the characters are actually useless, because someone you're more than by far can just do as he pleases with you and your moves. It would have been a very wonderful game if you didn't make it very unfair to the players. How can a ref count slowly for you and count fast for your opponent in a game? It's a rigged game, not challenging at all, just rigged.",
            "The best wrestling game on the market, and as a fellow game developer extremely well done for what it is, the actual controls have a bit of a learning curve but its amazing once you get them down. I had to buy the full game. Super excited for the new one boss. :) if you need a tester i would be honored.",
            "It was a nice and wonderful game, good graphics, almost real characters and credible moves but I rate this 4 stars because I think it wasn't totally perfect. May I suggest that you can set those attack here as a finisher or mid-air counter like superkick or bicycle kick. I think there's also a mistake in this game. How a gaunt wrestlers lift up a chubby and 7 ft tall opponent? Then if your opponent kick up to your pin, you can't get up emmidiately instead your opponent get up first than you."

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

Then stage 45 comes and your opponent is on a power level of 2000 and you are still on power level 800, what are you supposed to do?...and even worse it stays at this unfair disadvantage (basically it needs a ranking system) (Otherwise your only choice is to rage or switch characters)",
            "The game itself is not so bad. Nothing too much to do but a decent time killer. The thing that bothers me is that ea so blatantly attempted this to be a cash grab for them. In-game transactions are not optional, they become more of a necessity. After a few rounds the opponents start coming so overpowerd that it literally becomes impossible to climb to their level without using real money. I am at level 219, my health is 9000 and the opponent i am fighting has a health of 65k. Really ea?",
            "Sad. More EA sadness. Can't move yourself around with a left toggle, it pushes you in automatically. You just spam punch in hopes it lands, randomly tapping an icon on the left side of the screen where you should be able to move, for special attacks...ground and pound is quickest to accumulate abilities on takedowns/grapples. Really its not a good experience at all, for a fighting style about \"control.\" If i wanted to play a tap \"boxing\" game, id play that AND be able to control my character.",
            "Overall, this game is pretty alright. But it gets mundane pretty early on. Graphics aren't that great either. An obvious money grabber from EA. Watch UFC and play the latest games on console, this one just isn't it. Hoping for another developer to come along and revolutionize this franchise, but until then, stay on consoles :)",
            "Could be better if the computer followed the same set of rules as the player, player can NEVER punch the computer fighter out of a special move but the computer can ALWAYS simply punch the player to completely stop any special move, computer can use body hook to stop take down, player cannot, also it is physically impossible to knock someone out by kicking them in the shin"

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

Great game, I love it!!!!",

            "It's great for toddlers! But hey, parents, please PLEASE monitor you kid while playing this game. Ads pop up and they easily could tap on them. They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "This is one of the best games Gameloft has created and entertained the world. MUST READ: I have been playing this game since it's release and have grown watching its updates and its growth. I have played it since then on the PC. And now I restarted it on Phone This game is one of the best games till date and needs frequent updates and upgrades, please let the world experience more of amazing events, dear Gameloft. Please spend some time and money on this game rather than making low budget Games.",
            "Level 31 by now and... considering buying stuff. Game is surprisingly nice, fights are intense and graphics are excellent. There's a lot of ways the game could improve: controls could be better (more responsive commands, different commands for kicks and punches, maybe transparent and/ or physical buttons for these commands or so INSTEAD OF tapping and swiping), story mode lacks new chapters and new art for the menu (when choosing dungeons), but, generally, it's a great game... Keep updating.",
            "Its one of the greatest game I have played its an online game but its not like other games where it lags... The problem is I can't log in my account hope gameloft can please help me I have spent quite some amount of money on my account, at first I thought it was my phone but when I changed to 2 other and it gave me the same problem the game just crashes at the loading screen!! Please help me get back my account",
            "Awesome game . But now its is dead. No new fighter's no new PvP. And in sphere 6 fighter are missing. Please Gameloft give it New updates,and new pvp and fighter's. And give it missing fighter's in sphere. Please GoR. when we will get new pvp and update. In my phone game is not opening please fixed the errors. From 7 days my game is not opening showing errors. Fixed the errors and give new update please",
            "I don't usually play the same game for a long time unlike this one, 'cause I like switching to new ones and so. But I've been playing it for over a month and I really loved the concept and and the over all graphics and stuff. But the reason for 4 stars is because the controls. They are simple but there are many times, the characters won't respond to the swiping or tapping. Also it started crashing recently. Everytime I play it, it crashes atleast once within a 15 to 40 minutes time gap."

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game, and Sonic as a whole. But this \"free\" version is unacceptable. Far too many ads. This replaced the version I paid for years ago, which doesn't make any difference because the restore purchase button takes me straight to Sonic 2. Can't even find the paid version. Game 5/5, port 0/5 until restore function is fixed (this has been an issue for well over a year)",
            "It's a fantastic adaptation of the game and I would give it 5 stars if not for: - Scrap Brain zone act 2 is broken and loops back to the start of the level -- is this by design? It doesn't allow me to finish the game! - Even though I purchased the game I keep getting one add every time I open the app - I need to be online to play the game - come on man this would be amazing during long plane trips!",
            "I LOVE SONIC but this port aint the best i would rather play and emulated version and when ever i try to use debug it pauses the game i mean come on sega what the hell if this was fixed it would get a big five stars but still i love this game and i hope this bug is fixed PLEASE SEGA FIX THIS!!!!!",
            "One of the best ways to play the original Sonic the Hedgehog. Controls are surprisingly good for a phone port and widescreen definitely enhances the experience. Only problem is that achievements are a bit iffy; it says I got the chaos consiour achievement even though I only have three chaos emeralds. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.",
            "Not exactly a good experience. Saw three ads from the time I opened the game to the time I made a save & an additional two once I selected start. After the two ads, totalling over a minute, the game crashes, & process repeats. I could see enough ads I'd see from playing Sonic Forces for a week in just half an hour of trying to load a game. The controls are also really funky, making the game over twice as hard as it should. I'm disappointed, I expected better from one of my favorite franchises :/"

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",

            "I really like the way Sky map is set up, the options are great, but I have a confusing issue (solved). You were right, Sky map didn't know my lat and long, I played with the settings and it's right on point now, thank you for your help. The constellations seem to be rotated out of alignment. As an example, Cassiopeia should be almost directly over head given where I live and the time of year, but the app reports it on the Northeastern horizon instead, even when I use search.",
            "This app is awesome! I have yet to experience any other like it and I am such a nerd for astronomy anyway and it really helps to learn the constellations and actually ends up being an entertaining and learning experience for anyone but also for children they find it absolutely fascinating and it's been my experience that it opens their mind to science and space. I recommend it hands down way to go Google sky map!",
            "I really enjoy using your app. One suggestion of an option I would like to have, if possible, would be able to select an invisible background. Using the camera field of view as a background would allow the map to be seen as an overlay of what the camera lens is pointed at.",
            "This is fantastic. It gives real time location of the stars and planets. Just hold your phone up to the portion of the sky and you will see that portion on your screen. Point it down, and you will see what is below the horizon. Just be sure your phone has a compass and gyro. Otherwise it will not work.",
            "Bumping it back up to 5 stars now. I updated the app and now I'm able to take screenshot. I did try to email the Devs., but the email was returned as \"recipient unreachable\". I hope the Devs. see this as google play leaves no way to reply to their reply. Not sure how many stars to give this app after this disappointment. I have had this app for a long time. It's great, until tonight. I saw something really interesting that I'd like to share online but I can't. I can find no way to take a screenshot of the app. Why is that? Is there something that I can change to force it to let me take a screenshot? I have taken screenshots of lots of other apps I have on my phone and this is the first time I have ran across an app that has screenshot capability blocked. What's up with that? If it were not this issue of the app blocking screenshots, I'd give it 5 stars instead of the 3 that I'm giving it now."

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

            "Great game. Superb quality and excellent graphics. The only thing is when you run out of balls and you are sent back to the home screen you cannot continue without the premium bonus. There should at least be 1 more free gamemode or it will get boring. If it gets boring you loose players. If you loose players it will run downhill quickly. Please improve this. If it gets improved I will rate 5. For now its 4",
            "I love this game! It's really good,time eating and fun! The graphics is just out of this world! I just don't like 2 things: 1.the fact that you have to restart the game every time from the beginning (if you don't want to buy premium) 2.when you miss only ONE crystal you lose all multiballs!(and the steps). That 2 facts are the reason I gave this game 4 stars. I would recommend this though!",
            "It's really fun and helps me focus, the music in the background and the sounds of breaking glass is also very relaxing, but one thing i noticed is when they tell you \"checkpoint saved\", sometimes it doesnt let you click on the screen or doesn't detect your fingers on the screen, if you could fix that, that would be great!👌💖",
            "It's a really nice game . N I really liked it just the thing is that u have to take a look at ur balls otherwise it does not take time to be finished 😂 Leaving this the game is perfect. If u r bored u can absolutely play it. It's the best way to time pass. If u r out u will definitely play the other But u will never b full of this game.😁 Play and enjoy the game.",
            "I love this game! The only thing i have a problem with is there's not enough levels. I passed every level, then it goes to endless mode i think it's called. Other than that it's an awesome game, very well made. Side note: i did purchase the premium version, because of how much i love this game!"

            "Game is really good. But it can be taken to the next level. Some things I would really love in the game are - 1. Multiplayer mode, 2. Net shots can be better. It shows ' Perfect ' and still hits the net, 3. Not able to defend the smash but the AI defends the smash, 4. Endurance sometimes doesn't work as it claims. 5. Body language can also be improved in each shot. Apart from these, the game is well made.",
            "This is probably one of the best Badminton game on the market. BUT, there's a huge issues that i need to address... FIRST OF, the \"Frozen Time\" special ability in the game is probably the most annoying part of it. Not only that this ability makes the game much more unrealistic (even though it's just a \"mini game\"), but also it makes the game to become imbalance. SECOND OF, when the player beginning to run out of stamina, then suddenly i couldn't even smash the ball while midair. FIX THIS PLEASE",
            "Guest login gives you a random name, can't change the name even though I have google games installed, no achievement or progress there. I don't use facebook there is no other option. The difficulty is not there at all, The AI is completely predictable after few levels. I reached ACE in a day, still no challenge. Apart from all this, I enjoy playing this game.",
            "I played this game ages ago because I was addicted to badminton and was so impressed by what I thought was an online badminton game. This turned out to be single player and i felt quite betrayed, however coming back to it knowing its single player with everything they've added has made me so happy, the shot selection options is so pleasing from someone who has played for many years and its good to see some variations from hit short, hit long, smash. With drive shots etc. The game is very fun.",
            "Yes I have played this game for 2months it was nice but it has some issues and they are 1. It doesn't support solo vs solo from large distances like a person from another city and another city. 2. Their must be some more controls like places and techniques 3. The abiltes are not too fair . If these were resolved I hope I may give 5 🌟 star to it"

Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",
            "Game Is amazing I've earned all the bikes. I've made it to division 1. Physics are awesome. Very realistic. I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

            "I've played this game before, and I love it. But now that I've reinstalled it, it isn't loading. Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

Daycare 3. Space theme 4. Hospital 5. School i know these already exist but they would be cool to customize. 6. Pets to the customize list 7. Clothes to the customize list. 8. Masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to the list also. I know its a lot and it doesn't effect my game if they don't exist. I love your game! Bye!",
            "This game is amazing I love it so much and it is even better with the free updates , I can not believe they are free! But talking about what is free or not,the game is only starts getting really fun when you make purchases which is not so cool. Over all amazing game it is fun and cool.I love toca boca !!! I hope who ever reads this rewiew has a long awesome life,may you find someone you love and who will cherish you forever . 🤗",
            "I would have given it five star but u can fix the bug that when we keep things in our house from somewhere else and when we reopen the game it goes back in it's original place and the full version of the game is very costly u can at least give the full game for free only for three days trail so that we can see the other places that how it is like and then buy it. But it's the best game for kids worth game.",
            "I absolutely love this game! However I think there is a bug now that they added the Halloween update. I have seen other reviews that say that the houses are total wrecks. Mine is the same. My houses I decorated have furniture just in a pile, and everything else is just purple. Purple walls, outside on the balcony is purple, the floors are purple, and I cant move anything. Please please fix this bug. I have spent a lot of birthday money on this.",
            "The game is overall good, but before I bought the misty cottage. I had an amazing world and I must have atleast spent 5 hours working on it in total. But as soon as I got the misty cottage, the game started glitching out. Early morning the next day I went on the game and my whole world reset. Now that got me upset. I wish to report this app and I want it to be reported and sorted out immediately. I have everything in the game and its around £70 for it all. Not funny at all. Sort it out please"

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

I liked when the preview of each puzzle was larger and you scrolled through them left or right. Now the daily puzzle preview is so tiny I find it difficult to see. The preview of all puzzle packs, also don't scroll anymore. I liked that hovering over one, enlarged it in preview mode. Miss those features!",
            "Decent puzzle game overall, but there are not enough free puzzle packs! Also packs are expensive to get using coins (which are slow to get but the quests help), a VIP membership is pretty much necessary to have full access to puzzles and that membership is very expensive. But you can easily play a wide variety of user generated puzzles, these are generally not as good as the puzzles created by the devs but some are good! To top it off graphics and controls are nice and simple!",
            "*edit* The adverts keep crashing the game. I watch an advert to do a puzzle and after a few minutes the advert in the sidebar freezes up, freezing the game. I finally get the game to close and reloaded, and I have to watch another advert to restart the puzzle, and the game lasts about a minute before crashing again! This is normally a really relaxing game, but its about to go away.",
            "Your app has sucked since the beginning of september, cant play daily puzzle. Fix it. Update new fix didn't work. Still can't play daily puzzle. Game freezes when you try. You can only play one puzzle then freezes when you go to daily task and prize chest. 😵uninstalled and reinstalled. Still freezes when i try to play daily puzzle. And now i lost all puzzles i had bought"

            "Man, this game is one of the better free games on the Google Play Store! I remember when I was younger I'd play this game and from then to now the game feels a lot more polished and in my opinion is better then most games you have to pay for on the app store. It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",
            "New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",
            "Oh no!!what happend!!! All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

            "Really really need to be able to sort by earliest date with the years... If I want to start watching prime time etc from the beginning, I have to go alllll the way back through all the episodes.. When catching up on nxt i have to close my eyes while scrolling through all the epispdoes (in reverse) to avoid spoilers. Also open up the vaults already! More coliseum videos, and other old footage you have possesion of.. No one cares if its not in HD we just want to see it.. Crockey Cup 1987 !!",
            "Love WWE Network! I can watch anything from WWF/WWE, WCW, ECW, NWA, all the territories, etc. It is so amazing! Also love all the original WWE shows exclusive to the app. If you love wrestling like I do I can't imagine my life without this app in it. I watch it everyday. For example I just binged every WWE Monday Night Raw from 1998 and just started 1999 season! UNREAL!!!",
            "Could be a lot better, I was still getting ads even though I'm a subscriber, I can't listen to shows in the background as if you leave the app it pauses the video you where watching the app needs significant improvements because of how much it's missing when compared to other streaming services",
            "I love the network..ive never had a problem with it and have been a member since 2014..how come its not letting me go on it. Ive refreshed a bunch of times and have gotten the same results which has been just lag and errors. Please help a loyal fan and customer out. Thanks",
            "Horrible. The ap will not allow me to choose Bell as my subscription option. There fore I cannot watch anything live on my phone. I use Google Chrome and still I get a 400 error message when I click on Bell. Very frustrated and unhappy"

            "Love the game. 30 sec ads after each and every single play is frustrating. Found a way around it. Use it every time. Terminate the game as soon as the ad starts. Starting the game back up only takes 16 seconds! Many games are 15 seconds. Wish the newest similar game was not a constant ad at the top of the list of opponents to play. Tried the new one, did not like it at all! Maybe it is good for the new generations. Came back to this original version even though all kinds of stuff added.",
            "Full page ad after every single move. Every.single.move. Also, there is nothing to keep the screen from going dark during gameplay. You have to manually set it yourself and then reset it when you are done. Also, person with most points doesn't win, so I don't see the need for points at all. First person out of letters wins. So it's really just a game of who can use all their letters first.",

The developers obviously care nothing about the game play and have become nothing more than money grabbers. I know it's stupid but my own protest is to specifically go out of my way to never buy anything I see in one of these ads here.",

            "This game is insanely good!! I have an underaged account, which is very annoying because it blocks some features, but it is still the BEST game I have ever played!! The graphics are very good and the gameplay is even better! All these people that say that it is PTP (Pay To Play) are WRONG!! I am at the max level and am very good, I have never payed anything! Hope anybody who plays this game enjoys it! Thank you very much EA for making such an amazing game!",
            "I love this game. I don't spend and still enjoy it, although it is a grind, so don't expect any quick progression without spending. My one suggestion would be to have a randomized pull in the beginning that gives you a random but guaranteed character. Doesn't have to be anyone amazing. 1 or 2 star character that then makes your experience of the game unique. I know you can try and pull from a chromium card but no guarantees and gems are too valuable as f2p.",
            "The game goes out of its way to ensure you're not making any decent progress without spending huge amounts. In the first 3 1/2 years of the game, new content and characters were frequent, though in the past year or so this has seen a rapid decline. Game modes have grown stale and repetitive. Any new characters have ridiculous requirements to obtain them, we are talking 6 month to a year to unlock. The game lacks balance, leveling up/gearing characters is an endless grind with little reward.",
            "Collect Star wars characters, what more can I say. Have had the game over 2 years now and don't see myself leaving anytime soon. The game has its ups and downs, and of course there is a pay to win element, but it's in no way essential. Metas change fairly regularly and all eras of star wars are given their fair share of attention. The game also offers a great variety of game modes: Single player PVE, guild based PVE, single player PVP and guild based PVP. A fan of star wars must have this game.",
            "STAR WARS: GALAXY OF RIP OFFS. Just ok. Starts out fun, but then the game becomes total pay for play. The prices they ask are ridiculous. Supply drops r a joke since 99% of what you get, is fairly useless. No really special stuff gets dropped and updating characters & ships, unless you're willing to drop serious coin - isn't happening. The new characters are impossible to get without $. Don't bother trying to contact the developers - you'll never get an answer."

My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",

I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",

            "Good gameplay, great graphics, and interesting mechanics, but making progress in this game is. So. SLOW. Takes ages to get decent champs, a lot of progress depends on RNG, and most fights are too lopsided: either the opponent is a pushover, or it's an undefeatable mess. The story is alright, but like many comments before me note, it's mostly pay to win.",
            "Awesome..but after so long it's play to win.. 👆 That was my original view on the game in which I gave it five stars. But in all honesty. You cannot advance in this game. Unless your extremely lucky. After so long characters are just repeats. Over and over. And if you don't get four or five stars early enough. You use all the ISO you get from the beginning on 2⭐ or 3⭐ characters. Then you can't level the newer ones up. After that you have to spend money to even advance in the story line.",
            "The more I play, the less it works like it should. Pretty much makes playing battles pointless. It's like they set it so the more you play, the more you have to spend real world money, not to mention the rewards aren't working right. I actually lost resources when I claimed rewards a couple times this week. Fun in the early stages, but even my brother who played said the same. Not worth it if you want something to play long term",
            "Although there are a few instances of pay to win, I think this game has improved. I've played this game for about 4 years now and one of the biggest flaws it has is older champions. The older champions are almost always outclassed by newer ones. Because of this, you can easily get an old champion that hasnt been changed since 2016 and lose your chance at a new one. Also, iso 8 is insanely hard to farm or get easily besides duping a 4 star. Other than those complaints it's an amazing game.",
            "5 and 6 star hero advancement is insane. They've made it much easier to quickly get decent heroes. You can get a few 5 star heroes in a month now. But advancing those heroes to rank 4 or 5 will take months and requires a very good alliance of 30 players to accomplish. Tier 5 basic and tier 2 alpha catalysts are only really obtainable from !extremely! difficult content or from the glory store from doing Alliance Quests. If your not in a top 1000 Alliance forget ranking up your 5 star heroes."

So she just clicks around until it lets her move on. Since we do this through school, I asked her teacher to reset her level, but she doesn't know how. So she emailed customer support and recieved NO RESPONSE. pretty crazy since you know the school is paying for it. ABC Mouse is way better and way more fun.",
            "My kid likes the app, but it constantly crashes on our Android 9. Fast Phonics, peak 3, as the level goes up, the chance of crashing increases. E.g. it took 4 attempt before finishing level 18 on peak 3. First 3 attempts, the app just crashed and went back to the home screen.",

Hope you can grant my request, thanks much.",

I have played many other games that don't run out of videos like this game. Awesome game, if everything worked like it does sometimes. I had tornado gun at lvl 250 an got the bounce gun, but it only went to lvl 220 an wants items to rank up, but every previous gun would level up to the same lvl of the gun I had. Guess it's a way to try an cheat money out of people...",

Last but not least, you can turn off the music but why do you have to if there is no music at all 🤣 Even after the recent update, the problem still exists",
            "At stage 5 the shielded boss came and my shots are useless. No clue/tutorial to fight him. After 30min, out of frustration I charge myself toward him. Health gone but nothing happens. 10min later I was so frustrated and ready end it all, charged towards the boss, then surprise2, a robot came down. The robot damage the boss so slightly it takes 15 min to kill it. Clearly this game made by a brainless zombie"

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",

Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",

            "After the new update I can't get into multiplayer! WELL THANKS FOR NOTHING. At first I could stay for a minute or 2. And then I get lagged and it says connection lost when my WiFi is working well. There is nothing wrong with the connection or WiFi it's the game. So I just want to tell you all pls don't update this. Or you will regret it like me. I used to be a multiplayer addict, well I still am. And I'm so sad rn. Please fix this bug. And the report button doesn't even work. ~Thank you",
            "This game deserved 5 stars if there were not too many glitches, lags and bugs but in my opinion if they fixes these bugs than this would totally get 5 stars from me. If we talk about good sites this game is amazing and I love it. It's the best replacement for Minecraft and if you don't have enough money to buy Minecraft or your parents don't allow to than this game is made for you. Personally I play this game whole day and I bet you will love it if you ignore bugs.",
            "It's a good game, but it needs a report button or something to give certain players a warning so that they can be kicked off the server or something bc there's some people who just spam, I lowered one more star because it keeps logging me off the server even though I have absolutely no internet problem with anything else.",
            "Great game played this before tnx for making a game like minecraft because minecraft has to be paid for but i can download minecraft for free i like free games better and most especially Among Us by Innersloth LCC but i also like sandbox games like this too!

            "It's a dorky 2 d game. But I love it. I play it with my kids. Also toooooooo many ads! I am annoyed to have to watch ads to earn coins to buy upgrades. There should be a way to earn enough through the game. What if I pay$ 3.99 for no ads? How will I earn coins and extra power in the tournaments? I hope the developers of this game get stomach cancer. You think that's harsh? Try literally wasting hours of your life watching all these ads.",
            "Game is great. I have no problem at all with the actual game, HOWEVER, the thing that brought this game down from what could have been a four or five star, was the ads. The moment you open the game, there is no way you won't see an ad. Win a battle? Watch an ad. Loose a battle? Watch an ad. And yes I get that you can spend money to remove ads but a lot of players are freebees, and that really narrows down where you are getting revinue from. Please do something about the ads.",
            "I like the game, but the ads make it unplayable. An ad after every two shots, often before and after every game, and randomly in the main page. Plus you have to watch an ad to actually receive any rewards from playing. I decided to purchase the overpriced ad removal to be able to actually enjoy the game. DO NOT DO THAT!! It does not actually remove all of the ads. You still have to watch an add after every single round just to receive any rewards. This game is not pay to win, its watch to win.",
            "the game is a lot of fun although there is a warning right now there is a lot of ads on this game I would recommend playing with the signal off for such as Wi-Fiso if you don't want to get rid of the fads do not play with Wi-Fi on although it is still a very fun gametank stars is the best game I've ever played that is why I rated 5-stars I would rate it 10 Stars if there was a such thing",
            "When I first played the game I was super happy! I loved the theme and the easy controls! I am not giving it 5 or 4 stars, though. First, sometimes when I got out of the game and then came back the game wouldn't work, and that's not all. The only way to play again correctly was to UNISTALL the game! WHAT THE HECK?! I lost all my progress more than THREE TIMES! Second, because I am not done, there are WAY TO MANY ADS! Every 1 to 2 minutes an ad appears! If it had less ads..."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

I appreciate your work. There's also a bug when I reload a gun, the magazines disappear. Please fix it but otherwise the game is awesome.",
            "I played this game before and I also have rated 5/5 because it was amazing but after these updates it takes 10mins to get into any match even tho I have stable internet connection, I am changing servers but still the problem is there. I'm forced to drop only 1/5 because 5 days and I haven't even played even one match. Takes 15min but in the end it says \"Check internet connection\".",
            "It's one of the best mobile fps games out there. If you like CSGO, then it's likely you're gonna love this. Graphics, player control, and game balance are all superb. BUT I had to take away one star from my previous rating, because after the latest update there have been numerous glitches: you can't see your hands on CT side, opponents deform, glitch and altogether disappear at times, and the servers are lagging worse than I've ever seen. Just a lil heads-up. Hope you can patch it up soon!",
            "The new update is pretty great, but there is also a huge issue about it, the battle pass missions are taking way too long to finish. I am champion last season so my skill is above average, but it takes me at least 1.5hours to complete daily missions and only a few weekly missions, that is too long for a student and a content creator as me. Hopefully you guys can easier the missions as what u guys did last season or add coins we get after we finish a mission.",
            "Its a good game i see major changes in graphics quality and much more like the new training group which helps to improve skills.. I see a bug which is whenever i choose ct(counter terrorist) i cannot see my hands its like the gun is floating just the thing u need to work on Except that its 10/10. Keep the good work"

            "I love this game so much! I only had it for a week and its already my favorite. I have a couple of things that could be fixed though. Usually when I get a friend and I check my friends list they are not there which can be annoying. Sometimes when you try to load into a multiplayer game the map randomly isn´t downlaoded and it kicks you out of the game which is annoying too. It would be really cool if there was a friend and clan chat when your not in game. But overall this is amazing. 5 stars.",
            "Very amazing game. This game is very simple. You basically hunt animals and eat them to level up (if your sensitive to blood there's none in this game). You can even raise a cute family! [Maximum family members is 6). You can also change your animal, and it won't loose your progress! You can change it to a fox, bear, cheetah, crocodile, etc! HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃!",
            "I love this game but could you help me get on multiplayer because when I go on multiplayer it kicks me out and says Error connection to server timed out and that happened for 2 years! And it happened for no reason. I could not fix it! And it's still happening! Has that ever happened to you? And when 1 day passes I can go on multiplayer but if I exit and try going back it does the same as I told you at the second sentence.",
            "It's hard to control the eagle with flying, otherwise the controls are pretty darn good. Though I do know my phone is somewhat small and it's hard to simulate flight. I do think they should (if possible) add more plant variation like with bushes in certain maps. Maybe an aquatic update too? As someone who used to play when there was 3 play able animals, it's awesome to see this game grow! Sorry if I set my expectations too high or low, I just want to see the game improve for everyone.",
            "I love it, it is such a great game I have so much playing with outher players and by my self. But, there is some lag if you go on top of the land a little bit behind the poltel you can go throught that bit of land, be stuck there and have to tellport to your den. Beside that it is a great game. (In the clacis one.)"

            "I get sick of trying to explain this to game manufacturers, but 30 sec ads are a thing of the past. All you get is people uninstalling your game and complaining about the ads. Now a game with 5 or 10 second ads will get played and you will subject the player to a lot more ad time. How can you be smart enough to write a game but not be able to figure that out? Uninstalled.",
            "MORE ADS, LESS PLAY This is a pretty fun game but it's sadly riddles with ads. If you skip an ad for a reward, you're met with an ad anyways. That's cheap. Don't be cheap. I would love to see your company implement higher ethical standards when it comes to things like how often you subject your potential buying customers with ads. Right now it's about 10 seconds of game play VS. 120 seconds of ads. If you treat ppl better, they're more inclined to micro pay",
            "Pretty entertaining. However, the ads are excessive and what really irritated me was the coin math wasn't correct. If you watched an ad for a certain amount of coins, you did not receive that amount of coins. It was way less, sometimes a few thousand less. Something that basic shouldn't be wrong in a game. Very irritating.",
            "I wish I could give this a 3.5. Sounds are great, game play is fun, coins are useful and there's always a fun little \"3x coins! Watch this ad!\" Ads aren't a huge issue since you can turn your wifi and data off. I believe more detail on uniqueness should've been done, and more add-ons like bombs, or something that you get further on other than skins that makes the game continually fun. All in all, game is a fun time waster :)",
            "I like the game, pretty nice here, you get more people, fight other armies and bosses. And that is it. But the reason I gave 3 stars, Because 2 reasons. 1: The ads here are terrible. You just keep getting ads everytime you complete a level. 2: There is this weird bug where when I go to next level, this black screen kinda looking things keeps appearing and disappearing on my screen, and whenever that happens, it ruins my advantage of winning. Please fix this annoying glitch, Devs."

Playing the game is now even more enjoyable! Update now and see for yourself.<br><br>We have been working really hard to improve the game for you, so do not forget to leave your comments! Thank you for staying with us!",

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best 😀",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ♥️.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

Awesome to kill time, but the forced ads after just about every single round is a real buzz kill, especially when its after dying instantly to an AI spawned with really fast 1-shot projectiles killing the instant you spawn in. Not only do they spawn with unbeatable set ups sometimes, they have up to 6,000HP is as high as I've noticed. I have 717HP, still a 1-shot with anything let alone this. Update brought literally changes whatsoever. Game is more frustration than entertainment.",

I have never played a game this fun it is really fun super super super fun game I hope every body rated 5 stars I hope who ever looks at this if they don't have the game I hope they will downloaded it so I hope you give it 5 star please.",
            "Good game! However please take this review seriously...I have had it for quite some time now and, It definitely needs some improvements. When you are playing the game and you are near The spikes but not even close to them to where they should hurt you, they decrease your damage anyway That is something that needs to be fixed. Also, please bring back death Battle, I'm not even sure why you got rid of it in the first place It was actually a good feature to this game!",

            "10/2020 For the last several years I have used this app, but with the most recent update I'm considering removing it. The app no longer shows my documents, and still shows nothing after I try a restore. Hopefully this is a minor bug that's fixed soon.",
            "Fair warning- these guys are Grade A scammers. You know what's not fun? Rushing to turn in a paper only to have the scanning app you've been using without issues suddenly lock, with no warning, unless you pay them 20 dollars, just casually holding you hostage. In a panic, you fork over 20 dollars because what else are you gonna do? Anyway your paper ends up late, AND you're out 20 bucks. The kicker? They then ask you to rate the app. The only clickable option? 5 stars. These guys are dirtbags.",
            "Was perfect for years. Always used it to turn in homework. Now it doesn't save anything to your phone. Use CamScanner instead. It offers a student version that's way better and saves a PDF to your phone.",
            "Great app up until the update. I cannot find my tiny scan folder in my files on my android. Now I scan and can't figure out where my pdf is going. Have done everything to figure it out and cannot seem to find it."

Headache is the human nervous system i.e. the nervous system and the neck related problems. Usually when you undergo any emotional or physical stress, then this problem appears as a physical reaction. In such a situation, not only the head, but the neck and the back also cause pain. Nowadays the headache is a very common problem, but if the meditation is not given during the time, then this problem can increase.\r\n1. Tension headache\r\n\r\nThis is the most common headache. In this type of headache, the person feels the acute pain on both sides of his head, like someone is pressing the rubber band from both sides. Due to such headaches, neck and shoulder muscles become very tight and feel swollen.\r\nReason: This kind of pain is caused by stress, lack of sleep or injury to the head.\r\nNote: Stress-related headaches can also be exposed to cold air. When the winter comes and the cold air moves or the air comes in contact with the air condition, when the air appears on your neck and head, this condition can also be a headache. Physiotherapy can be quite beneficial in tension headache .\r\n2. Migraine\r\nThe pain in migraine occurs on one side of the head, which is also called alfalfa. In this headache, the patient may have trouble with nausea, vomiting and light. In this, the patient feels pain like sticking something in the head.\r\n\r\nCauses: This headache can be due to the sharp aroma, changes in gold currency, changes in hormones, consumption of alcohol, stress or even loud noise.\r\nNote: Apart from this, this headache is also done with the consumption of certain foods, such as chocolate, dairy products, fruit of groundnut and citrus.\r\n3. Cluster headache\r\nThis type of headache is quite acute and painful. Cluster headaches can occur several times in a day, but do not occur for a long time. Sometimes it starts at any one time, like - if it starts in the morning, then for some time it will be in the morning only. This pain can occur at one side of the head and one eye, because it also affects the nerve of the face.\r\nReason: It can be due to heat, exhaustion, smoking, alcohol intake and more or faster light.",

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "I love it for the most part. We have a lot of fun using the face warp and other than the face changing from one look to the next when we do not want it to, it usually works fine. If that is sometjing that could be improved, it would be almost perfect. Perfection would be to allow 2 people to be in the video with different face warp options. That would be nirvana. I recommend this app as it is though. Still so much fun can be had.",

So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",

Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",

Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "Nothing really works, unless it's a function that entails you giving them money. Never an issue, there! But, the biggest turn off for me is the PvP arena. There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

            "Works great as a vpn but the only reason i didnt give it a five star is because the vpn will randomly turn off wothout notifying you. This becomes a problem because it happens very often. And its not time based either so there is no way to predict when it will happen.",
            "A goated VPN but some times I have to restart my phone before using the VPN because it doesn't connect say I opened the app I connect to the VPN and I turn it back off then in another time of the day it won't connect for some reason. I would give it a low rating but because it's a decent VPN and a free one ill give it the benefit if the doubt.",
            "This app does work and you dont have to pay for it. The only bad thing about this app is that random ads pop up on your home screen, apps and camera. I deleted it, but it is a good app for those who can deal with an ad pop up every 30 minutes.",
            "Only VPN I've tried that doesn't bombard you with excessive ads even when not in the app (surf vpn and those damn tik tok ads) and doesnt have a timeout limit. Update: Now throws ads at you after each and every click."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

            "Bed wars...kind of fun game but I only have one problem from the game. The joystick, when I always walk on the bridge (The one with wool that players can buy from game) it always go to the right side of my joystick!!! So I fall down when the joystick let me go to the right. Please fix this bug!!!!",
            "Ok so I got this a few days ago and have already seen hackers and people braking the game. Although it's a very fun game and you will have alot of fun playing. It would be better if it had the creatures or ender pearls(preferably both). And make to where it's one of those games where its you die in the first 3 Minutes of the game. If you fix some or all of these issues I will raise my rating. Other than that I enjoy this game very much so. It is worth downloading.",
            "Sometimes I wonder why this game is still up. I can't even count how many people I see hacking, breaking the game, and more clown moves. And the game producers have done nothing to fix it. So it is really annoying playing the game. But I can't stop beneath all the stuff I listed it is a really adictive game which is why I didnt give one star. But if these things dont get fixed I would rather play something else.",
            "I love this game!!!! it's soo fun..in the real Minecraft bedwars the swords,fireball and more cost ALOT of iron ,gold , diamonds and emeralds and it's harder to PvP so this game is better!!! please make more game's I love this too much!! I hope everyone is doing well and happy in carona virus (covid 19). 🙂🙂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🤍🤎🤍",
            "I only tell honest reviews. This is mine for this game: This game is probably one of the best games for android outside of Minecraft for blocky graphics. It has a very Minecrafty feel to it and I really enjoy playing this. Congrats to the developers. It has every basic weapon that ordinary BedWars has and then some. I also enjoy that everything works like it does is real deal Minecraft. Definitely a good pick."

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries.

Please resolve this issue ASAP because this game has trend breaking capability... Hoping a positive response from gameloft team",
            "Hi there. I've been playing the game for the first time. And i like this game very much. The things you can update is: 1. You can improve the in-game graphics, 2. The sensitivity is too poor if i want to look around the battleground some of the inventories automatically open up, you can fix this. 3. You can add more different kind of troops and heros. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SAY . Download the game . HAVE FUN 🤩🤩",
            "This game is awesome but this server issue is beginning to piss me off.. I why now you... I enjoy playing the game & I love it but having this server reconnect issues every time I try to play it... all your games are great mostly the best but you don't care about uswho are playing them. If it not ads it server if it not that is logging issues why.. why do you promotes incomplete games bugs everywhere in your games. come on guys help us out here.. don't ignore our cries... we are your supporters",
            "I really enjoyed playing the game but I had to start over twice cause I attempted to sign in to Facebook and the game glitched out. I played without connecting to fb made it to level 19 and the game just froze. Will wait until these issues are fixed before I play again",
            "Wonderful game.I like it.But there is a thing i don't understand: I didn't receive any reward when my VIP level up from 5 to 6 and from 6 to 7.You said: tap and collect your reward. I tap,tap,tap and tap,but nothing happend.Why?"

            "Great game! A good time piece for lockdown. However... the new update rolled out today and I am on of the 1 in 5 males who suffer from colour blindness. The new darker colour scheme does not work for me. Will it stop me from playing? Probably not, though the previous version was better suited to my disability. It would be good if the developers could look at winding it back. Naturally there are a few bugs in the new version also, namely trying to play another game. It freezes on my Samsung S10",
            "Really good for the CS fans. Few bugs, about the final tally and lag in the game. Rest, still online game, it feels like AI or computer or bots playing the game. Difficulty level can be increased. Secondly, making squad and playing with friends is the issue.. We have to restart game after every match.. New update, people are hacking it easily.. They are not dying to head shots also.. Nevertheless grt game.. ❤️❤️",
            "Latest update is really bad. It has lot many bugs. Please fix all the bugs soon or Revert your code changes to previous version that was really good and stable. It is not allowing all the players to be in the game. Sometimes only 2 or 3 including CT and T. And sometimes only one player. LOL. How can we play with ourself.",
            "You have ruined the game after new upgrade.. listing down few problems.. - It's taking too much time to join the lobby and teams r not balanced after joining and sometimes no one else is joining. This is most serious problem. U hv ruined it. - Players r joining in mid of the game. - CT has also bomb after team flip..lol - No option to exit the game after joining the lobby. Many issues with UI",
            "Additive game. Critical Review: 1.sometimes don't starts properly saying network issue, despite network is perfectly ok. 2. Latest oct. Fancy UI upgrade made the game slow. Kindly make sure I was using ultra high quality video in previous version and game was working perfectly. In the recent version even high quality lags. 3. Games works at medium quality but it's very irritating for eyes. Feature Request: Add live voice intrection with others if possible."

To the point that you can do anything. After a long time trying to work around the ads. I tried to save it. Only to get yet another pop up to do a 3 day trial then $ 7.99 a week. Yes, a week. Are you F-ing kidding me.",
            "This is a nice app to use but the reason I gave four stars because we can't change our face by face copy option, but by clicking on manual cut option we can cut the photo and paste it to other animal or something we want to paste. Overall it is a nice app",
            "It is great! No watermarks or anything. And for free?! Five stars no hesitation.",
            "If the collage creator had an indicator to lock picture straight I would add a star. However the ads in this app are horrendous. You are forced to watch a 5 second add every time you add a photo!! Not good.",
            "Its a great app, but most of the time when an ad pops up the skip button bugs out and completely frezzes, making it impossible to skip a very long ad. And one time when it happened again, the ad bugged out and froze, and the ad was there. No matter what I did it would not get out of the screen. I had to restart the whole app and lost all my progress when I was cutting a big photo. You are very lucky I didn't rate you 1 star. This better be fixed, or I'm changing my review to 1 star."

I would've given you a five but the bonuses are small and that's what draws me to a game. Hi I'm back and starting over my pad had a melt down so I had to clear it. I have some favorite games now but I still find it strange that the bonus`s are so small and at times you get nothing from the free spins. So bonuses are a waste of time.",

Please try later.\" When that message is the norm, \"temporary\" is a misnomer. This issue has persisted over several updats, hence my reason for deducting two stars (playing over wi-fi with a strong signal and a fast connection)",
            "I've been playing DUC for several years. So addicting! I do have a couple of suggestions: A \"Collect and Send All\" button for gifts. It takes forever to collect gifts each day. It would be helpful if you could tap one button to collect all gifts and also return gifts that were sent to you. An \"Accept All\" button for friend requests. Would be another time saver...could spend more time playing the slots.",
            "I'm just wondering why the old downtown slot has been removed. There has been several new slots added but for the older slots like the old downtown slot game there hasn't been any new ones added like those types for a long time. I like that game and was very disappointed to it see it gone last night. Why was it taken down and will it be put back up, if not I may just remove this app and find another one. Very disappointed 🤔 so for now I am dropping the five star rating to three stars."

            "Interesting but wayyy too slow paced. Theres not enough players online so it take forever to match up in multiplayer to earn coins and the \"story mode\" has a waiting time for every match which is wayyy to long. Both of these make earning credits too hard in the game which makes it too slow to progress and increase your skill in the game. Developers should add another way to earn credits that doesnt have a limit or waiting time.",

It has one most worst point in which it allows to play only at when time arrived in case of offline and another point is that in case of online playing u player won't come soon it Will take lots of time and sometimes it won't connect also.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Downloaded the game to see what it was about. Waiting for it to load which was exceptionally long load time, only to get to the main background screen and nothing else. Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

Not in this case, at the higher leves you're at the mercy of rng to get you the best buffs, and to drop you the items needed to evolve/upgrade your gear, which is insanely tedious and grindy to do if you don't want to spend any money",
            "I have been playing for a long time but am feeling very stuck as new stuff is added. There are almost too many items now. I never get the items I have any more so I haven't been able to upgrade them. The new character evolution system is awful. Way to hard to get the character shards you want. You can get them randomly as rewards but there are a ton of characters or you get the soulstones to buy them in a once a day dungeon. So I really can't evolve the character I want.",
            "Been playing about a year now and it Use to be a pay to win game but they've made it to where you can simply wait a long time to be able to summon them. They stay on top of their updates, (and surprisingly I'm always pleased about it ). Only problems I can see with the game is that you can spend 10 enegry on a event to get runes and when i complete I only get around 1-4 runes. Not even enough to forge. Also I think the levels need to show how much xp is needed to get the next level up in game.",
            "Used to be my favorite... Until it wasn't. A bit bloated making progression slow but that's not the issue. Main issue right now is crashing. Loved doing daily events, but it's hardly working out anymore, depleting 10-15 stamina, then the app shuts down making the event unavailable upon reopening. Have been an avidly player for well over a year, but lately it's been a let down. Events and co-op were my main stay... Not so much anymore. It's been cool archers! Edit: Player ID 1-3221180",
            "It was fun at first, but I quickly got to a point where it is almost impossible to advance without spending money. After spending more on this game than what a couple brand new console games would cost, it's still almost impossible. This is one of the worst cases of developer greed that I've ever seen. Even the newest update looks to be designed to get people to spend even more money. The game just isn't fun anymore."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "I absolutly luv this game! It is super satisfying. You get new knife's to cut with, and you find super cool objects inside each soap that you cut. It's so calming! :3 However, one thing i dont like is that if you want to open your \"mystery gift\" you have to watch an ad. I dunno! maybe thats just my device but otherwise this is such an amazing game! Keep up the great work! :D",
            "Pretty good game after all, but you need minimize the advertising. That's really annoying after each game, there's an ad. And please get rid of the vibrating... This game is played for satisfaction but it clearly annoys me on how much ads and vibrating is. When you are cutting, my phone starts vibrating and it's really unsatisfactory. Kindly make changes..",
            "I LOVE this game, it is so satisfying and fun to do!!! The only thing that I don't really like about the game is just that there is an add after every single round, but then again I don't mind because the adds will give me something to look forward to (the satisfaction) but I would definitely recommend this game 👍♥️👍♥️",
            "I love this app, its relaxing and because its offline it can work when you are bored without wifi unlike some games. It's a good app and you should get it because it lives up to expectations, plus you can unlock more soap knives in different styles and colours. Also if you dont have a lot of soap, dont want to ruin it, but you want the same satisfying feeling as other vids well this game is totally for you.",
            "I love this app! It makes a very unsatisfying noise once you are done with a level.And all of the soaps make the same sound when you cut them.But all of the good things about this app make the bad things seem very tiny.I love how satisfying this is!I wish i could soap cut in real life but my parents don't let me.I love all of the different knife types!They are very awesome.I would play this all day!Thank you CrazyGames,I hope you keep making amazing games!Plus, your ASMR slicing game is awesome!"

            "There are times when the game wants you to watch an ad to get a skin but won't let you do it. Then when I die I have to whatch an ad to play again. Most of the skins are bad but the only good ones are the impossible ad ones. And some of the obstacles kill you even if you duck or dodge it. Worst of all, I hit in the green zone on an epic level and got killed somehow.",
            "Very poor game not satisfied plus has too many ads a irritating game.I was just playing level 24 it started flickering and I don't understand what is the need of epic level . Epic level is just like this just for coins.Coins we can collect while winning. I am angry due to so many ads after each level ad. For opening chest room ad. For new skin ad , means this game is filled with ads and I don't like the games which have ads.I am not satisfied with the game and. I wanted to give zero stars to it.",
            "Experience on this game is amazing you can get so much out there you can get new Skins and it can sort teach you how to be more skilled to but the game is quite buggy the game is kind of different it's not a normal game and I would not recommend this game well I would but but if you ever played this game I'm sure you feel same way but all you need to do right now is just download the app",
            "If ads pop up, just turn of your WI-FI or Mobile Data, that way you won't get any ads at all. That will make the game less laggy too! I love this game, it's interesting, and quite funny too. I rate it 5 stars.",
            "I rate this Five because this is cool for me i don't mind it the ads. The ads it's little, i like this game i love so much i think i'm up too 100 but it's fine this game i like it."

I will just dislike you more. Oh god cut it out already! And again! Stop! Yet again? You're wasting your advertising budget. And again, you waste your ads. Your advertising system is cheating you, theu show your ads to the same people over and over again. No new people at all.",
            "I really like this game, but at level 25, there is no warning, difficulty does not increase, they just stop giving you goals to proceed, and the game is over. You can harvest all day, but you're not progressing any more. Also, the ad with the big long harvest blade is false advertising, you never see it. It was a fun game, but sadly lacking in the end.",
            "This is disturbingly addicting. I cant stop playing for some reason. I do have a slight issue with the controls, though. Sometimes it feels too sensitive, and sometimes it seems to turn in the opposite direction of where it want it to go. Also, time extension bonuses would be a wonderful addition. I feel bummed out when I'm so close to getting a personal goal, but im cut short by a few seconds.",
            "I love this game but it froze up. This is the second time. I had to delete it and reload the game. I,m not doing it again. No other game has done ever this! You get to level 25 and I guess thats it!! GAME Same old same old from then on. Done it, good bye, hope they expand it was fun.",
            "This game is SOOOO MUCH FUN. Its not got that many ads as others are saying it has. Its a good way to pass time but my only problem is sometimes when time is over it asks me if i want 2x more than i earned and i pressed \" no thanks \" but it still gave me an unskippable add. This has only happened 2 or 3 times so it doesnt ruin the overall game. Still 5 stars🤗"

            "This game is awesome my favorite game on this is zombie mode that is super cool and just game I don't know what to say I like the first and the other one they're good but this game is very amazing I hope you have some more updates like you game modes and I hope you have a good Halloween🎃",
            "Hi NESM.This game is good it is good, but the things are hard to get like hulk and some other weapons I rate it 5 but please be sure to fix this problem for the people who have money it's easy but people who dont it's hard. Plz make hulk cheaper. Thank u.",
            "The game is epic, I'm not gonna lie. The first thing that irritates me is, I cannot see the gauge of other sticks. I just keep on fighting them until I can't fight no more. The second thing is, we can't take other sticks' weapons after they have died. If they die, they must leave the weapons behind so that I can take them and finish the rest of the sticks off. Those are the only things that I wanna see in the game. Maybe you'll add them in Anger Of Stick 6: The End Of The World 😃😃",
            "Very good and additive game but only one problem; can you change the archer control function? It is a bit difficult to aim and yes one thing! I think you should add horse riders BTW very well done ✅ keep updating 🤠 Thank you 😊"

Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "Kinda fun until level 59. Then you basically have to fill the entire board with the highest level plant. Which is nearly impossible as the board fills. Fun game play up until that point but that gouge for money at the end has me wary of anything else these guys make. Level 60 is the final level so they do it to you right at the end. Not worth it at that point, trust me.",
            "I got to phase 7. What happened?? Plants VS Zombies at least had a story, cheesy tho it was. This one just tedious. But I deleted because of the ads. I mute the music and the effects. What makes you think I want to hear the stupid ads? I have to search out on each one where they've placed the mute, if they put it there at all.",
            "Fun and a good time waster. I love the many different plants when leveling up. There are many ways to earn extra coins and plants. You just have to be a little patient due to ad breaks. But all in all it's a good game.",
            "It's fun and addictive just gotta chill on some of the adds like the gold coins you obtain and spend for killing take the add off of the buying plants on that it's terrible",
            "It's far from a game. Even if I paid to remove the pointless adds that every game has, this so called game would still be slow and pointless"

            "I love a quick game when I have a minute but lots of the newer ads force you to wait for 30 seconds or longer and when you try to close using the X it opens up the google play website. Not just once, but over and over again. Especially bad with 'playable' ads. I sometimes don't even bother waiting to play the game and choose another app. I can't click on your link from here, but I'm using Android 6.0.1 on an Asus tablet, if that helps.",
            "Love love love this particular Spider Solitaire! I got to the point where I had to delete the app because I was playing it too much! The ads are fun, relative and short. Not very invasive. Gives you the option to delete ads and start the game or keep watching and play when done. Fun little goals to achieve within the app, as well. This is THE BEST. I'm sad I have to stay all over cuz I was like almost a year's worth of medals and trophies etc.. Haha. Thanks",
            "Great but you've started to have ads that play sound even though my phone is on silent with media sounds off. This really should not be allowed. I can't play a game that does this as it annoys people around me. I should not have to use earbuds to avoid that. It's my phone and I choose, silence. If this continues then I delete this game.",
            "When I first downloaded this game , over a year ago, I really liked it. I enjoyed playing the daily challenge and earning a jeweled crown. My crowns started disappearing overnight. I've contacted support several times , but they couldn't tell me why this happens. They gave me some crowns back, but that's beside the point. It continues to happen. I've even uninstalled the app completely, turned off my phone, and reinstalled. That doesn't help. I think I'm done.",
            "playing 3 Mobility Ware games until recently. Had to delete free cell first. now it's spider that's glitches. Stops working, juddering, shuts down my phone. Shame. Will switch to other card apps. UPDATE Oct 2020. Reinstalled working ok. Now plagued by Asian ads you can't read so dare not click on as no idea where it will take you. Then game freezes."

            "I'm giving it 3 stars just because it is a very fun game and I play it fairly often. The lack of a 4th & 5th Star is simply because it is heavily geared (pun intended) towards pushing one to spend on IAP's. There are campaign zones, arena missions, PVP (this last is pointless once you get past the tutorial stage), and each zone or stage calls for certain weaponry, armor, perks, etc, which will cost you a lot of money as you upgrade equipment and buy better along the way. Fun game, but costly.",
            "I do like this game, nice and challenging at times and fun to play, but I think grenades should be added to the game. Do this and I'll give 5 star. (Update); Demoting to 2 star as I'm confused with lvl 27 on the third campaign map (Road Block Rumble) as I've seen a few vids on YouTube, it shows an armoured vehicle next to the guy on the left. But for some reason on my game, that vehicle is not there and is next to impossible to do. If this is a glitch, please fix and I'll give 5 star.",
            "It's amazing and I couldn't think of anything else it's challenging it makes you think it's like a puzzle every time and when you do his shooting part it sad that you're shooting other people lessingham the game is like you're saving a country and an existing secure in the army or you're a soldier saving its family or everything is just gonna be so much fun and it's really interesting when you play, and I just I love it so much! And it's just amazing So this thing's amazing!!!",
            "I have enjoyed this game greatly although there is a definite advantage to those who wish to spend a small fortune but it is what it is game on. I have not stated the game could not be played merely that there is a distinct advantage to those who wish to spend cash on the game. I do enjoy playing it just wish there were atleast some better options for obtaining premium weapons. Like completion of special levels to earn say a premium alien weapon or zombie weapon that would be more beneficial",
            "PVP is a waste. You play against the computer times I played. Developers will tell you otherwise, but they're lying. I quit playing it for the most part. No real sense playing when you're spotted as soon as you enter. You've no idea where they are, but they watch you for a few seconds then kill you. Or they'll disappear and appear elsewhere and get you. Better yet, you'll have one in your scope, he's looking down, as you're about to shoot, he looks up and shoots you. So the developers are lying."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "Can you Add lines at the aimer when you zoom in on a target its very annoying when you forget what range you hit the target at then you have too waste shells just to find him. Heres something else can you update the damge to the tanks its annoying when i shoot a panther with a 76 gun to its side 5 times for it to die or worse i shoot it multiple times and then he shoots me and then i die in just two shots. One more thing can you add where you can repair you tank if it gets damaged and crew too.",

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "it's a fun game but I love everything but I wish there was more weapons like ice guns and stuff another thing is that I would like a online mode and friends. So recently I haven't seen any bugs or glitches so far and the ads you can get rid of them. I have been playing for 2 years now. This review was 1 hole year ago It's Now 2020. Good game. Create more games you only have 2. Hey Mr. Develeper can you actually listen to me because We need an update with more weapons and career. More players.",
            "Really, really good game, play it with my friends all the time. It's really fun, but I think you should add an online section that counts your points when you win against actual humans. So you should add an online where you play against other people in the world and there should be a leaderboard, can you please add this. Please. And also this game is quite smooth on all phones that are generally modern.",
            "This is amazing. I played on a friends iPad and I loved it. The simple to understand but hardish to control battle style is a blast and evens the some op weapons out. I've mained cards as it is just so much fun, want to keep enimies back? Sticky card. Want to deal damage? Explosion card. About to fall off the edge? Place swap card. Anywho this game is just amazing and good gameplay. 5/5. Simply amazing.",
            "Hello developers i hope you see this! I've been playing this game for so long and i loved it!But here's what i really want you to add in a new update:- *Online Multiplayer (upto 4 players with big maps) *Skins:like colors,hats,mask,suit,and if you could add a shop section it would be nice! *Private lobby to play with friends:-) *Make more buttons for eg:- Jump,special power,shield, etc. So,please developers notice my concerns, just a little improvement would make your game more fun. Thanks.",
            "This game, is one of the most original games based off of popular pop-culture hostory. Which is very impresive from my point of view, this game is so good, other people make games that try to live up to this standard exactly how this came to sucess. I love this game and will appreiciate it for as long as it is avalible on this very app store... :]"

            "Very nice game, I always wanted a game that 1. Was like salt 1 and salt 2 2. A game with no ads and doesn't sell personal information. 3. A developer that supports the game and the people who play it. 4. A game that only takes 2MB! However, I do wish that you could after saying Never to that prompt for the membership, you could still have an option to buy the membership without re installing it. Thats my only complaint, other than that, the game is fun and enjoyable, I recommend installing.",
            "I really like it, but there's some things that really annoy me. The uranium shouldn't always go critical and explode as there's plenty of options in game to keep it cool (specially in small quantities) and when under pressure liquid nitrogen as well as other liquids should remain there instead of simply disappearing. I would love to provide better feedback and help you improve this engine. It's really fun, but frustrating.",
            "I am obsessed with this game. It's so relaxing and gives me so much creativity to do whatever I want. I can cause absolute chaos, experiment with different materials that correspond with real-life physics, cause more chaos after getting distracted from my experiment. And it is so relaxing and satisfiying. Not to mention ad free, bless these people. 10/5 stars if I could",
            "When I was in 5th or 6th grade my friends and I were all obsessed with a game similar to this on one of the popular flash game sites of the time (this is over 15 years ago, like before Numa Numa Dance). I haven't seen another game like it since, so it's a really nice to see someone bring it back. We used to kill hours with that game back in the day, and I can see I'm going to be doing the same now! There's some suggestions I could make, but the dev is well on their way to perfection as-is.",
            "As a kid I just loved playing in the sandbox. This sandbox is even better than the one that I played in as a kid, all the different elements for one thing are so much better. And I never even found one cat turd. Thanks for omitting the cat turds, although I would like to see what the reaction would be between cat turds and crud oil mixed. And exposed it to a flame. Thanks to the developers of the game and the fact that you have no ads. Thanks again, Big \"D\"🙈🙉🙊"

            "I love this app . And it has no ads. U can do anything u want. This is the best thing. This is the best colour app . All apps have ads . But this isn't . So I am so happy . ❤❤ . And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "I've had so much fun playing this game. it's awesome! I love those soundtracks They put a different soundtrack for practice mode so it's like you have to complete the level in normal mode to enjoy the music. The levels are hard, i must say, but the music is what makes you want to complete it. However i would recommend shapes and beats much more. its much easier than geometry dash. But this game is also cool. Try it. You'll have fun!",
            "This game is Awosmeeee! the music and everything is so cool this is perfect for offline games and geomitry. One thing i like that it is 1:offline 2: geomitry 3: all of those other 1 2 and also i love this game!!!! the last thing i like about this game is that its filled with entertainment and its offline and geomitry and fun all mixed together.",
            "absolutly addicting. There is no flaw with this game. I see it a lot that people complain of the ads, but there is a simple way of fixing that, and that is turning off your wifi. I recommend this game so much, not only is it fun, but you get good jams added on to it!",
            "This is an amazing game! Love the music and everything. Played all the other Geometry Dashes and I would highly suggest you get this and all the others. And to Meiya Carter... this game is supposed to take lots of tries and be difficult... they are inactive because there are many other Geometry Dash games that they are focusing on. If you get all panicky that's because you haven't gone through that part yet. I suggest you keep trying at it... takes many tries but is fun once you learn the game!",
            "For me I think this is a great game... but if you dont have a lot of patience then this is not for you. There are some ads but they only come up once or twice, for me I love it. Its the best like when my friend comes over she ALWAYS wants to play this game. Its very addictive and also after high school I always wanna play this game. I love it. Rhank you for making this"

Ads, ads and ads EVERYWHERE. This is a pet peeve, and i need to turn off my internet just to have peaceful gameplay. Secondly, the bots. Its suprisingly EASY to get past all the stages. Maybe add game modes? Like battle royale mode, a hard mode. Make it challenging once in a while. I don't find this app good or bad, its pretty decent.",

            "The things i hate about this game 1)bots can grab your weapon like it's my weapon,dont grab it,thats pissed me off. 2)the hit box:i be checking replay and i died and sum hits dont even hit me. 3)settings:i changed flexablity and i play story mode and they flexablity is like mine,uhh hello i changed how i play not yall. 4)npcs hit box:all npcs are bigger than you which means bigger hit box but not in this game they have the same hitbox as your cac. That's all cya",
            "I've been playing this game for years its so enjoying sometimes when i'm bored i delete the game but when i remember the game i install it again, The reason i only gave 4 stars bcuz there's no more updates like new weapons new stages and others i'll give u 5 stars if u add an update. Thank You.",
            "This game needs more updates, like weapons, characters, 3 RPG save slots, and more customization like a sandbox mode where you choose enemies and their weapons and map customization. I have 100% the game I beat all the campaigns single and co-op 3 stars maxed out RPG stats for player and weapons and all stages. Endless mode single 28 is my best, co-op 48 I intend to raise them further. This game has awesome music by the way.",
            "actual broken game, it said realistic physics but the enemy's weapons can go right through your weapon no problem and enemy's with no head hitbox? oh ok, I almost completely destroyed my phone because of this game, don't download if you want to have a mental breakdown",
            "Its a good game, but I got bored of the combat. Its too simplistic, and it almost feels luck based. It was a thrill before, but now its uninteresting, and a game not fun, isn't worth playing. It can waste time though. Rpg mode is a grind"

When I sing, I hear my voice but it's to slow for the song. It has a second relapse. You keep updating changes and once upon a time I could fix it. Now I can't. I am not paying my monthly subscription until this is fixed on your side.",

            "5 stars, much better than Smule in my opinion! The people are so nice, and getting VIP here is so worth it! A bazillion songs to pick from, each one is amazing quality! Thank you for this awesome app! I will add, this app is hard to wrap your head around, but it took me about a day to figure it out.",
            "This app is indeed for singing but sometimes if we wanna sing the songs we like why do we need to become VIP. Can't we just sing without paying money. Coz to become VIP we need to pay. So sometimes it's very annoying. But this app is good too. I have nothing to say more but please remove the VIP system to select the song. It is so frustrating.",
            "I have no idea what happened.... The song lyrics have been cut like a lot... And usually there are a report button but I cant seem to find it at all and I believe that you take it out... So please please fix it... I love your app, i been using this app for long time already! Please do something about it"

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "I am still enjoying this game almost 5 years later for me. A thing the developers can add is possibly a custom background, example being that you can use your custom skins as a background in your profile. I don't have many complaints about the game other than it lagging sometimes, but it's not always the game's fault for it.",
            "Very great game, The only problem I had was the lag and me colliding with bigger blobs, Nontheless, I love the game! Keep it up, nebulous. :}",
            "I think it's an amazing game, I love that you could play offline. You could also talk with friends, I say that it's a nice thing of them to put different servers in different areas, so it's better for some player's lag. The only problem I'd see is that black holes or any kind of hole spawning on your blob. Also, when you die from being really really big your screen still stays zoomed out. Great game!",
            "GREAT GAME!! Except.. You can't get plasma fast at all unless you win a giveaway which is only god knows, how rare.. So please fix that :)"

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "Robots game seems to not pull from yard, as much as player. Robot should not have every number to match while i'm pulling from yard. Totally different from live play. You don't give a player the exact points that the other player has like 4 or 7. Round it out nearest 5. Also when playing robot or a player the person who locks the game loses & the points goes to the opponent& that opponent goes first the next shuffle",
            "The AI like to cheat and give the player the worst hand ever. The AI had like 3 points while my team only needed 1 point to win. Ever since I had 99 points out of 100 the AI cheated and kept winning. Now I see why this game is on Google play pass because no one wants to play against cheating AI",
            "The game is designed to cheat to win, once you select the hard mode. Ive been playing dominoes too long not to know this. Theres no real online action going on. Just a computer. You guys are good!👏",
            "Probably one of the best dating apps out there. I am really happy with what the app has been offering so far. Definitely recommend this to all the single people in my life :)",
            "A few things can be changed. Often too many doubles are dealt - 4 or 5 in a hand ! Then, you miss the start of the match because of the and your first domino is played for you. You could also insist on players signing in as \"guests\" often leave when they see their tiles or have to pick from the bone yard straight away."

            "This is my favorite truck driving game, good controls, challenging, lots of fun, the only bad thing is while you're driving the ads that pop up at the top of the screen and stay there while you're driving makes the game lag so bad you can't hardly control or play the game ,So if you could Please fix this problem, I would Definitely give 5 stars",
            "The game is okay. But there are a lot of ads. The controls are hard because they are so small. The triangles for turning are okay but they are tiny so it makes it harder. Half the time i try to hook up to a trailer the truck and trailer collide causing damage on the truck and it wont hook so i have to exit out of the game to reset it so hopefully the next time i watch 5 ads to get in it will hook to a trailer. The game iver all is fun but every time i stop to get fuel, at the scale, or to sleep",
            "When you try to hook up the load most of the time it acts like your hitting something or your truck just goes right threw the load, very frustrating!! And you can't see the red lights even when zoomed in, please fix these problems! Other than that great game, I will give 5 stars, when fixed, thanks.",
            "The gameplay is superb. But needs some improvement in graphics and make it a bit more realistic. The game also needs 6-lane roads and new places in the map. Overall this has the best handling among all the other simulators. Also, everytime I go to Nashville, I'm charged with a speed ticket, no matter how slow or how fast I am. I have been playing this since 2017 and still cant get enough. Although now a little bored with gfx and maps.",
            "Couldn't play the game for more than 15 seconds without an ad. And why would I want to pay for an ad free experience if I haven't had an opportunity to try the game. Also, the game requests access to contacts, and wants permission to make and manage phone calls which seems odd for a game like this."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

And after the fighters win they are award gloves&etc",
            "Uninstalling Rate: Energy doesn't Reload if you exit the game!!! Small full energy. The fight sounds are great, the game play is ok, not much different action it's more energy more speed same action, same commentary. Plenty fighters.. defeat him you can fight as him.. pointless but that's the rule.. & no updates since 2018.. Bye",
            "The boxing overall is fun n easy to understand how to play i think the trainig should be open at all times. Instead of some hours because in the two days ive played it seems impossible to improve ur boxer or even buying equipment that good n i dont understand why put such a high price on tatoes Overall the gameplay is good but for player like myself who cant afford the ingame purchases it makes the game very difficult to play the hair design needs to be clearer and the commentry",

Zebrainy is an educational game where you can find all sorts of learning games for kids, no matter how old they are.\r\n\r\nZebrainy will help you to develop kids’ memory, reading skills, matching abilities, concentration, and creativity.

Please refund my payment as I cancelled within the day. Thanks.",

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

I also love how you put a Daily Race where we actually get to play with real players. I have absolutely nothing to say. Just It is an Amazing game. I recommend you to download this. It's Amazing.",
            "This game was great and made me feel like I was playing mirrors edge all over again. It did have ads, but that's not why I am not giving it 5 stars as it's a mobile game and I only saw an add every 3 to 4 stages. The reason I am rating it 4 and not 5 is the frame rate. Frame rate is key in these sorts of games. It ran smoothly mostly but sometimes I would encounter frame drops, not massive, but enough to send me plummeting to my doom. Otherwise, the controls are great. And no micro transactions"

            "My main objections are with multiplayer mode. Here the scoring is pretty much unfair. I have scored 21 goals against my opponent's 16; 90% success compared to my opponents 67% and 7 combos against 5 ! Yet I lost the game due to whatever reasons. Maybe he has scored higher combo bonus but yet it is unfair and biased. You guys should fix the scoring system.",
            "Multiplayer mode is useless and unfair. No value of skills and merit. Anyone having expensive boots and balls can win. Such a biased game. You can't enjoy a game where you know that win is guaranteed by spending money and buying boots.We play games for competition, we play games for hardship not for unfair advantages.Developer should understand and fix this otherwise don't download and waste your time.",
            "Not good if you can't afford to purchase the golden ball. You can't win online since the opponents score will double and yours not..better put a level playing field for all since not all can afford to purchase the ball",
            "Cool concept, but forget winning in 2 player mode. You can hit much higher %, more combos and still get destroyed. Deleting now",
            "A good game ruined because the developer is greedy for users' money. Apparently users who spend money have better balls and boots and you'll score the same type and number of goals but they'll have thousands of points above you. Doesn't matter how many 90° goals you score it's pay to win. They don't even sweat. If Ronaldo scores a goal with his Nike mercurial and some Cagliari player scores with a very cheap boot they'll all count as a goal. Football is about surprise and this game lacks."

Before that we gets not only stars but also something like 🎀 ribbons. After failing the challenge there is no backup which demotivate player. The game mode story I didn't like at all and challenges are so easy. In the game now the time has came to give some videos otherwise game Will be so much boring. Mission is getting difficult to complete.",

After I've opened the 3 chests, I tap no thanks and another round of rewards keep coming back. This keeps on going and I never get to play the game. Please fix this.",

            "This game is fantastic for casuals but an absolute nightmare for dedicated individuals. There are many factors that make the game impossible in order to progress the main story; Timer, character traits that can leach or stun characters whilst being hit, or just being weak in general can cause you to lose the game, causing you to grind out numerous levels that can do the same thing. I am glad however that in the competitive scene of this, all is fair. Overall, just stick to multiplayer I guess.",
            "I would say probably my favorite game at the moment, still think it could be better though, maybe add some skins to the game to make you feel a little more unique instead of just color changes, would also be cool to see more characters, I grinded the game almost completely in about 4-5 days and unlocked every character in the 3rd day (including the new one) just something to think about maybe",
            "Good game... But online is bad... What I try to say here is the fact that the game itself is a lot of fun, problem is, when you want to play online, is saturated with Squigly, Fukua and Annie users, why? Because of how hard is to deal with them, they could be called \"cheap characters\" due to the fact of how hard is to deal with their moves... They really need a nerf because my God, you just can't beat them without making a single mistake! Thanks and keep up the hard work! I love this game!",
            "Such a fun game and I only finished one part to the story, there is so much in the game and I'm so ready just to play it, the only thing tho, it they give you way to much stuff and way to much going into the first few levels which is kinda broken so I keep a solid 4 stars, other then that, this game is perfect .",
            "I'm a huge fan of Skullgirls for years now (pc ver) so when I saw a mobile version I was eager to give it a try. I've got to say I'm beyond impressed. The game does all it can to be as close to it's pc original as it can and does a great job at it while still providing some new content (completely new stories to read among other things). The mechanics are a lot simpler than the pc ver but they're as good as you can get on mobile. It's worth playing if at least for all the new stories :33"

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

            "I like this game but I don't understand why you have to watch adds to get some clothes. It's so annoying but other than that it's a great game. I like the way you don't get the same clothes for every girl. It's fun because you can use your imagination but I really wish you could move the people around. It's ok for kids but at the start they're all in bra's!! It's cool that you can start with any girl though. So it has a good side and a bad side",
            "Hooray, this update brings a much needed feature - saving your progress. Thanks, devs! This game is enjoyable. So many possible combinations, I've played for months, and still haven't created the same girl twice. Lots of categories - skirts, pants, shorts, long shirts, short shirts, jackets, scarves, jewellery, make-up, hair and more. Plus 4 skin tones for a realistic group of girls. The best dress-up game I've downloaded, definitely worth installing!",
            "This is good enough but my opinion is that you just change the yellow girl cuz she's not my favorite but thank you and she does not have good outfits you need to make more outfits for them and please don't make them extra fancy they all go she's my favorite but she needs more good clothes",
            "Game was okay but I did have a problem with a dressing it up so I could get there while you could only dress it up and you couldn't do anything with it so that's why I gave it to just start reading but I wouldn't really recommend you couldn't get it cuz it's kind of boring.",
            "This game is excellent, fabulous, fantastic, amazing, and interesting. I love this game. I suggest you to also try rhis game to those who will see my comment and I am sure you will also love it"

            "I used to play this game a lot. Now I rarely log on. I took a two expansion break when my favorite deck rotated out of standard. When I came back, I had no real way of efficiently acquiring new cards as f2p and so I am stuck. My old deck was fun in standard, but can't hang in wild. I don't have enough cards to build a deck I like. I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars to be relevant. And besides, the game just keeps speeding up and power creeping its way towards MTG status. Not a fan.",
            "New battlegrounds mode made me come back after I stopped playing regularly a few years back. Was having fun but now it lags so much the timer on screen is just straight up wrong. 25 seconds left? Just kidding you're going into endgame with 3 minions and two goldens in hand, -32 rank points. Fix your game before you add new modes behind paywalls, Activision/Blizzard. There's too much competition to rest on your laurels.",

The app constantly disconnects in the middle of a game, meaning I have to close the app, reopen it and wait for the app to restart and reconnect to my game, by which point I've often lost my turn and have also missed the other players moves. Awful! It's been this way for months. Why can't you fix a simple glitch?",
            "Great game hands down, but currently a 4 star rating due to the fact that i had progressed so much further on two other accounts and i can't even log into the, the game will give me the optuon to choose my old accounts but glitch out and not load any further and keep me stuck forever. Pls help me resolve this problem and i'll gladly give my 5 star.",

There used to be an option in chromeOS to allow parallel running of tasks but now that has to be handled at the app level. you need to keep visible task running when losing focus Chromebooks are now able to run android apps so if you support Android then you pretty much support chromeOS.

            "Scam, do not bother. Forces you to subscribe for almost 10 dollars - a month (!!!) before you even get to play, and then it is *still* choke-full of ads on every corner. The game itself is functional and has a few songs to play, but there is 500 others like that on the market that don't behave like scams. Oh by the way uninstalling will not unsubscribe you, you have to go to the play store->hamburger menu->subscriptions. Yes I know the first three days are free. It is still a joke.",
            "I can't play.When I start the app, it shows me a way to continue and be a member(common)I click on the \"x\" and then another page appears wich allows me to pay for the membership I look and wait for an \"x\" I see none I can't do anything except pay wich I will NEVER do.I am really disappointed in this app I thought it would be fun but turns out it's just another stupid scam.DO NOT INSTALL.",
            "This is a horrendous app!! Won't allow you to even play, without paying 70 for a 1 year subscription. There is no way to exit, no X or option to use limited features. Total scam. Don't waste your time. Developers, you need to fix this issue!! Or delete the app!! Calling you out...",
            "At first when I saw the reviews I thought they we're lying. But once I installed it, is said Free Trial 67.98/month! Please fix your game developers. And also warning for the people that want to install it. *SCAM ALERT! DO NOT BUY!*",
            "***SCAM ALERT*** The app is a scam,It will not continue until you subscribe to its annual subscription which is about $50 US, This app shouldn't be on the app store. Its something different to give a trial version, but not letting you continue without subscription, thats some next level scam. Let the user decide if they want all the features."
