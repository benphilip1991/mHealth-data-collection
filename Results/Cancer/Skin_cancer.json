Melanocytic lesions will be divided into nevi or lesions with varying levels of suspicion for melanoma based on melanoma specific patterns and common nevi patterns. Non-melanocytic lesions will be analyzed to determine if they are suspicious for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Common benign lesions such as dermatofibroma, seborrheic keratoses and hemangiomas will be positively identified to avoid unnecessary biopsies.

Also, don&#39;t expect any numerical quantification of skin spots (like instant ABCDE evaluation which is common in other skin apps), since it is useless and can only harm you.<br><br>The evolution of a spot can have direct medical implications:<br>- rapidly growing skin mole may be a sign of melanoma, a dangerous type of cancer<br>- appearance and growth of rashes might indicate food allergy<br>- sudden change of a healing wound may be a sign of an infection",

This is due largely to our climate, the fact that many of us have fair skin that isn‚Äôt suited to such harsh conditions, our proximity to the equator (high UV levels) and our social attitudes and love for the outdoors.\r\n\r\nBasal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, the most common types of skin cancer, tend to develop on parts of the body that get a lot of sun exposure, such as the face, ears, neck, lips, and the backs of the hands.\r\nSkin cancer ‚Äî the abnormal growth of skin cells ‚Äî most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.\r\n\r\nSkin cancers aren‚Äôt all identical, and they may not cause many symptoms. Still, unusual changes to your skin can be a warning sign for the different types of cancer. Being alert for changes to your skin may help you get a diagnosis earlier.\r\n\r\nWith Our Skin Cancer , you learn the risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options for each cancer with illustrative pictures.

This is due largely to our climate, the fact that many of us have fair skin that isn‚Äôt suited to such harsh conditions, our proximity to the equator (high UV levels) and our social attitudes and love for the outdoors.<br><br>Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, the most common types of skin cancer, tend to develop on parts of the body that get a lot of sun exposure, such as the face, ears, neck, lips, and the backs of the hands.<br>Skin cancer ‚Äî the abnormal growth of skin cells ‚Äî most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight.<br><br>Skin cancers aren‚Äôt all identical, and they may not cause many symptoms. Still, unusual changes to your skin can be a warning sign for the different types of cancer. Being alert for changes to your skin may help you get a diagnosis earlier.<br><br>With Our Skin Cancer , you learn the risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options for each cancer with illustrative pictures. We‚Äôll also cover steps you can take to reduce your risk of skin cancer and keep your skin healthy for years to come.<br><br><br>Our Skin App includes<br><br>Why is skin cancer so common in AUSTRALIA<br><br>Understanding Skin Cancer<br><br>Skin Cancer Symptoms <br><br>Skin Cancer Causes \t<br><br>skin vision<br><br>mole checker<br><br>Actinic Keratosis (AK) \t<br><br>Atypical Mole \t<br><br>Who Is at Risk for Moles<br><br>Basal Cell Carcinoma <br><br>Merkel Cell Carcinoma Prevention<br><br>Merkel cell carcinoma <br><br>Squamous cell carcinomas signs<br><br>Squamous cell Carcinomas Causes<br><br>Leukoplakia<br><br>Melanoma <br><br>Fast facts on melanoma<br><br>Stages Of Melanoma<br><br>Types Of Melanoma<br><br>Superficial spreading melanoma<br><br>Nodular melanoma<br><br>Lentigo maligna melanoma<br><br>Acral lentiginous melanoma<br><br>ABCDE examination\t<br><br>Merkel cell carcinoma \t<br><br>Squamous cell Carcinoma <br>\t<br>Skin Cancer Fighting Foods <br>\t<br>Skin Cancer Pictures \t<br>&quot;",

I hope in the future they can make it so that you can still use the outdated app for a period of time after the update is pushed to avoid the issue of downtime. Original Review: App won't let me into the main menu. Keeps saying that there's an update and redirects me to Play store. Once I'm in Play store there's no option to download a newer app. I think the service is great but this error keeps happening so I can't use it.",

            "I tried a different app like this one and didn't like it at all it didn't work. so I researched and found this one, I have nothing but good things to say. My experience was way better then I expected, dr. Peppercorn was awesome, he is very knowledgeable,explains everything, makes you feel comfortable, listens to you, he cares, follows up and answers all questions quickly. He has made my experience great and I will use this app again if I need to and hopefully I get to have him again as my dr.",
            "This is awesome! Since everything is slow right now (COVID) I looked into online options. Right away they were able to tell me if they accepted my insurance and estimated my copay. I answered a few simple questions regarding my symptoms and after discussing a treatment plan with the doctor, I was able to pickup the medications prescribed at my local pharmacy next day. SO fast and easy! I will be using this anytime I need a derm.",
            "Update: Maybe it's not a scam afterall. Finally got some medication 14 days later and 38 days later for the other meds. The\"visit\" is text message format and lasted about one week because of approx. 24 hour delayed responses from skymd. Refused to refill my script I've been using for years and they never responded to the pharmacy, resulting in no medication for two weeks. It's $90 for each visit because insurance companies don't cover e-visits. If you can wait a month for meds, go for it."

Once users upload a photo using the free smartphone app, QSkin returns the top three recognition probabilities. Currently, the AI model can recognize 26 types of prevalent skin diseases with high confidence based on our database. With a shortage of dermatologists in Canada leading to growing wait-times, this free app has the ability to improve access to care and save lives. In the near future, we are aiming to provide a more comprehensive and accurate solution.\r\n\r\nHowever, QSkin does not provide medical diagnosis services. Such diagnosis services can only be provided by dermatologists. QSkin is an artificial intelligence tool to assist users for potential cutaneous risks.\r\n\r\nList of the 26 types of skin diseases that QSkin can detect currently\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Acne\t\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Angioma\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Basal cell carcinoma\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Cyst\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Eczema\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Fibromas\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Folliculitis\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Granuloma\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Herpes\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Ichthyosis\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Keratosis\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Lichen (Lichen planus, Lichen nitidus)\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Lupus\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Lymphoma\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Melanoma \t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Nevus\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Pemphigus (Pemphigoid)\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Pityriasis\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Psoriasis\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Rosacea\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Squamous cell carcinoma\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Syphilis\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Tinea\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Ulcer\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢Urticaria\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Wart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccuracy\r\nThe dataset feeding the AI-model includes 123,454 dermatologists labeled skin disease images. Currently, the AI model can recognize 26 types of skin diseases with the accuracy of 90% based on our test with over 5000 dermatologic images excluded from our training dataset. For the detection of melanoma, our AI model achieved 96.5% accuracy. \r\n\r\n*Accuracy = Number of correct tests/ Number of total tests\r\n\r\nServices\r\n\r\nIn order to use the QSkin Services, you may be required to register with QSkin by providing your email address and creating a password in order to access and use certain features of the Service. You will be asked to validate your email address within 24 hours in order to make use of the service. You can also register with Google or Facebook account. You can personalize your account by choosing a profile picture and by filling in the Personal Profile and Skin Situation questionnaires. We provide the following services: \r\n\r\nStandard service\r\nWith the QSkin Standard service, you can take a photo of your cutaneous concern with your smartphone; this is then uploaded securely to the QSkin server and QSkin then returns to the user the top three skin diseases with the probabilities. The Standard service is free of charge. \r\n\r\nAdditional services\r\nIf you would like to keep track of your records and request some treatment suggestion, additional service fees will be applied. The user needs to pay the fee via iTunes, PayPal or Google Wallet in accordance with QSkin instructions. And you will get the flowing services:\r\n\r\nRecord management to track changes\r\nQSkin provides storage to allow you to store your skin-related photos in the server so that you could track the size, shape or even color changes. Thus, you could have a reference for your skin situations.\r\n\r\nTreatment recommendations\r\nQSkin gives some treatment suggestions according to the detection result. We do neither provide professional diagnosis nor guarantee the validity of the suggestion. It is the responsibility of the user to estimate if accept our suggestions.

Once users upload a photo using the free smartphone app, QSkin returns the top three recognition probabilities. Currently, the AI model can recognize 26 types of prevalent skin diseases with high confidence based on our database. With a shortage of dermatologists in Canada leading to growing wait-times, this free app has the ability to improve access to care and save lives. In the near future, we are aiming to provide a more comprehensive and accurate solution.<br><br>However, QSkin does not provide medical diagnosis services. Such diagnosis services can only be provided by dermatologists. QSkin is an artificial intelligence tool to assist users for potential cutaneous risks.<br><br><h3>List of the 26 types of skin diseases that QSkin can detect currently</h3><br><br>‚Ä¢Acne\t\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Angioma<br><br>‚Ä¢Basal cell carcinoma\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Cyst<br><br>‚Ä¢Eczema\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Fibromas<br><br>‚Ä¢Folliculitis\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Granuloma<br><br>‚Ä¢Herpes\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Ichthyosis<br><br>‚Ä¢Keratosis\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Lichen (Lichen planus, Lichen nitidus)<br><br>‚Ä¢Lupus\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Lymphoma<br><br>‚Ä¢Melanoma \t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Nevus<br><br>‚Ä¢Pemphigus (Pemphigoid)\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Pityriasis<br><br>‚Ä¢Psoriasis\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Rosacea<br><br>‚Ä¢Squamous cell carcinoma\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Syphilis<br><br>‚Ä¢Tinea\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Ulcer<br><br>‚Ä¢Urticaria\t‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\t‚Ä¢Wart<br><br><br><br><h3>Accuracy</h3><br>The dataset feeding the AI-model includes 123,454 dermatologists labeled skin disease images. Currently, the AI model can recognize 26 types of skin diseases with the accuracy of 90% based on our test with over 5000 dermatologic images excluded from our training dataset. For the detection of melanoma, our AI model achieved 96.5% accuracy. <br><br>*Accuracy = Number of correct tests/ Number of total tests<br><br><h3>Services</h3><br><br>In order to use the QSkin Services, you may be required to register with QSkin by providing your email address and creating a password in order to access and use certain features of the Service.

You might be under the feeling that surgical activity is important to totally expel moles, warts, or skin tags...well, luckily there are a lot of common medicines that are sheltered, totally regular, and promptly accessible. Furthermore, you don't need to go to a dermatologist\r\n\r\nYou will learn in this app:\r\n\r\n1. Intro about the skin tags\r\n2. What are skin tags\r\n3. How to identify the skin tags\r\n4. Signs and symptoms of skin tags\r\n5. Causes and risk factors \r\n6. Conventional treatments\r\n7. 12 Effective home remedies to remove the skin tags:\r\n\r\nHere is a list of home remedies for skin tags removal that you can try.\r\n\r\nApple Cider Vinegar\r\nBanana Peel\r\nBaking Soda\r\nBloodroot\r\nManuka Honey\r\nWitch Hazel\r\nGarlic\r\nGinger\r\nOils\r\nJuices\r\nShea Butter\r\nEpsom Salt Bath\r\n\r\nIn the medical community, skin tags are known as acrochordons. They are small growths, or flaps of tissue, that stick out from the surface of the skin. Skin tags are commonly the same color as the flesh or a little darker. They typically remain quite small, ranging from 1 to 2 centimeters, but they may grow larger.\r\n\r\nGenerally, they do not cause any pain or discomfort. However, if they are subjected to friction or damage caused by clothing or jewelry, a small blood clot may occur, resulting in pain. While it may be tempting at that point to simply cut it off, this is not an acceptable way to remove a skin tag. The best practices for how to remove skin tags at home do not involve cutting; this is dangerous and may lead to a severe infection and permanent scarring.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to go for fancy chemical or cosmetic procedures to remove these outgrowths. You can use simple ingredients found at home and get rid of them easily, and at a very low cost. Please keep in mind that even though these natural remedies take a little longer than the chemical procedures, they are safer and more long-lasting.\r\n\r\nPeople often get confused between skin tags, warts, and other similar looking skin outgrowths. The following explanation will help you differentiate and identify skin tags easily.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that most people are entirely unaware that they are living with these skin outgrowths. Quite often, skin tags fall off on their own due to friction and rubbing. The trouble arises when they don‚Äôt, and when they grow to a large enough size so as to cause embarrassment or even discomfort. Here are some key features to identify them:\r\n\r\nThey look like little mushrooms with their skin stalks\r\nThey are pendulum-like growths\r\nThey are brown or flesh colored\r\nIt is essential to cut off the blood supply to these skin tags if you want them to die and fall off naturally. Certain home remedies can help remove skin tags naturally.\r\n\r\nIf you want more information or anything else inside the app, please contact us from inside the app and we will contact you.

            "Used to be a great app. Simple to use and it told you how long until you would likely burn. It has become increasingly buggy, does not respond or response slowly, does not update your location automatically and bugs you to spend money. I appreciate you need to monetise to survive, but you'd think that would mean the quality went up not down. Very disappointing.",
            "it does work to remind you to apply sunscreen however if you have the device and sit down for a period of time in the shade it will turn off, very irritating. I would like a calculator that doesnt shut off until you tell it to. Also would be nice to be able to work offline if you are out of cell range say hiking etc."

        "description": "Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion.",

I had signed up on my old phone (as it said do this so you don't loose anything when you change phones) which is now broken  now I have my new phone, but theres no Sign-in or restore and no easily accessible FAQ. please point me in the right direction or kindly tell me how to restore onto new phone",

The fact this app just lets you take photos instead of uploading them for comparison is stupid. There are 7 types of eczema and not all types remain presentnon an adults body. Please research these types and add them to your app. Otherwise this app is a waste of time. I wanted to use it to show my dermatologist the outbreaks, but nevermind now."

But the only issue I have is that it doesn't give me very many options in the very beginning and none of them fit the description of where I am having the health issues. However I do like that the questions after the first category is fairly thorough which is nice and how it should be. I just wish it gave more category of options of health issues at the very beginning to better pin point what is wrong so I can get the correct treatment for my symptoms.",
            "i think that this is probably the best way they could have created a free, un-official diagnosis app. i guess i'll give it 4 stars though. my only suggestion is maybe: when you get to the end of the process and it shows you your diagnosis, highlight the title of that page, or make it stand out a little more(just so i dont just click past it thinking its just another disclaimer, and have to start all over again) . either that, or let the user look at their past activity within the app itself :)",

A beginner student could have made this app. It displays at least 3 ads before you get to your \"diagnosis\" (which was far from correct, by the way.) They claim it's artificial intelligence and that they got help from doctors, but honestly, it looks like they just googled \"common diseases\" and \"how to make an app\" and combined the search results.

            "I really like the app and I love the idea of it, but it needs some work. The scanning feature is wonderful! I'm not sure why you can submit some products for review, but not others. The camera never gets a clear picture of the ingredients. So I'm submitting many products, but getting emails saying they can't read the ingredients. My phone camera works fine and is always clear. Also the zoom is off. Its starts out like a far away fishbowl mode and when you zoom in it never focuses properly.",
            "What an absolute waste of time, this app could be brilliant, but it's buggy, clumsy & frustrating. I don't have time to keep logging in everytime I use the app, if & when it decides to recognise my login details. Really, there aren't enough words to describe how this app just misses the mark at every turn.",
            "This app is helpful for basic skin sensitivity tracking, but may be difficult for those who, like me, have 5+ different chemical contact allergies (each of which usually has more than one name, making tracking or memorization hard). Was hoping to use this app to help me steer clear of products I may be allergic to, but you apparently need a Personal Allergen Code for this. And unless your doctor subscribes to this app and gives you a PAC, you can't get one or make a list on your own. :/",
            "Omg one of the most useless apps I've ever had. Such a BRILLIANT idea, but lacks information, range of products. You don't have L'oreal?? Come on seriously? Can't input your allergens without a doctor. Unable to upload a picture of a product as its so blurry you're unable to read the ingredients. You're sitting on a amazing idea. But that's all it is. No sense of efficiency here. Don't bother downloading and wasting your time.",
            "This app lets you search a database of almost 50,000 products to choose products that are free of allergens or unhealthy additives. Great if you have sensitive skin but can't afford to buy high-end products all the time. There are almost always a couple of very affordable products that score just as well as the expensive ones for being free of bad additives."

Unfortunately, on my Samsung A50 the text on the larger widget does not display properly (it is too high for its container so you cannot read it). Also both widgets are way too short - they use very little of the screen height that they take up / occupy.",

Our insides are certainly important, but skin treatment is your first layer of defense against the outside world. Skin can also give important clues to your overall health. Learn to take good care of your skin, so your skin can keep taking good care of you. \r\nSkin protects your body in many ways. The skin provides a barrier to protect the body from invasion by bacteria and other possible environmental hazards that can be dangerous for human health.\r\n\r\nSkin can also alert you to a health problem. A red, itchy rash might signal allergies or skin diseases, and a red ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù rash on your face might be a sign of lupus. A yellow tint might indicate liver disease. And dark or unusual moles might be a warning sign of skin cancer. Be on the lookout for unexpected changes to your clear skin, and talk with your skin doctor if you have concerns.\r\n\r\nYour skin can become too dry if you don‚Äôt drink enough fluids or spend too much time in sunny or dry conditions. While washing hands is important for good hygiene, washing your hands too much can also lead to dry skin.\r\n\r\nThe sun can damage your skin as well. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) light that causes sunburn and makes your skin age faster, leading to more wrinkles as you get older. There‚Äôs a strong link between UV exposure and skin cancer. So protect your skin from the sun. Wear hats and other protective clothing, use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, and restrict your time in the sun during the late morning and early afternoon hours, when sunlight is strongest.\r\n\r\nMany skin researchers are studying the skin‚Äôs microbiome‚Äîthe bacteria and other microscopic organisms that live on your skin. Some of these microbes can be helpful. Evidence suggests that they boost the body‚Äôs infection-fighting immune system and help keep you healthy. But there are some skin diseases with known associations with certain microbes. In the long run, scientists would like to find ways to support healthy skin microbes while reducing harmful ones.\r\n\r\nThe importance of keeping your skin healthy can't be overemphasized. It's the body's first defense against disease and morgellons, and it protects your internal organs from injuries. It is, in fact, the largest organ in the body. The skin helps regulate body temperature and prevents excess fluid loss, and it also helps your body remove excess water and salt.\r\n\r\nSkin conditions can affect anyone‚Äîyoung and old, men and women. Acne, hyperhidrosis and eczema are just a few examples of common skin disorders. The good news is that there are soap notes and a number of simple ways to keep skin healthy, and there also are now many options available to treat skin conditions, if treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer : If you think you may have a skin problem or need to learn how to better care for your skin, consultation with a dermatologist‚Äîa physician who specializes in treating the skin and keeping it healthy‚Äîmay be in order.

Apart from some copywriting issues, they need to make sure they have a solid USP before pushing it out to the market. App is snappy and loads fast and graphics are aesthetically pleasing.",
            "Very good app, have not seen or used anything like this before, shame this wasnt out earlier in the year as I burnt a few times over the summer this year and an app of this nature would have been a life saver instead of trawling through various reviews of different SPF products trying to find ones that were fairly decent.",
            "Easy to use app that helps you to identify your skin type and potential reasons why you could be suffering from certain complaints. Includes a calendar to add reminders for your skin care routine as well as a weather app that works by location and recommends what type of sunscreen would be most appropriate and needed to match the weather. Cool little app with some interesting articles. Worth a look I was impressed",
            "This is a great little app to educate about skin/sun care and includes useful personalised advice after completing a simple questionnaire. The today/weather feature helpfully gives weather forecast and UV information and the newsfeed can be tailored to your travel preferences too. The app has been designed to be used in conjunction with the ioniq sunscreen sprayer but you don't need to have it to benefit.",
            "I was suprised by this app. It's really nice and easy to use. I loved the features and also that I can customise the skincare to me. My favourite feature has to be the today tab, I love being able to customise it to my area and it gave me the suggested SPF. That's is so brilliant."

        "description": "This app Color Atlas of Skin Diseases - Dermatology Atlas is for medical student, doctors, dermatologist, nurses and other health practitioners to understand Dermatology Atlas with Treatment. The cases contain pictures (Zoom in/Out of illustrated color images), etiology and treatment of many skin infections.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2. History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nDon't forget to share it with other doctors.",

            "The Neutrogena Skin360 app provides a handy place to record skincare progress, but doesn't provide much more value than that to someone who is already experienced with skincare. The NAIA AI software doesn't always work smoothly.",
            "It is nice to see these kind of apps that tries to somehow guide you through your skin problems and suggests you to try those problem specific products. However, I just felt it not so effective and practical as a lot of it depends on under what kind of lighting you are taking your photos. Also , every phone's camera's capacity is different so I don't think the app really works to it's best. However, I do like the product selections. You can easily find variety of skincare products.",
            "The app is great for anyone who doesn't know where to start for their skincare routine. I was impressed with the products that were chosen for me as I use them already. I love that I can see my skin improving just from using this app. I even got my teen daughter hooked on the app, she says it keeps her wanting to improve her skin.",
            "I like the analysis part of this application. It captured all of my face quickly and clearly and set me up with what would be best for my skin. I added a new face cleaner and moisturizer by Neutrogena. I think the app really is useful. My skin looks so much better now. Will definitely use again.",
            "I was skeptical at first because let's be honest how is a app suppose to tell me what skin product I should use and it actually work. Boy was I wrong!! This app not only told me the products but it also gave me a morning routine and a night routine to follow. I give this app 5/5 stars and will never delete it! If you haven't tried it believe me you don't know what you're missing! Its so nice to know i don't have to keep wasting money and time on face cream and its all thanks to this amazing app"

            "I installed this app on my account for the first time back in 2014, at the time I paid to get all services unlocked and it was great it was only a one time payment.... the app kept growing and improving, mostly because they added a cloud service. In 2019 I decided to pay monthly just because I needed to sign a document. After I realized I could sign any document in pdf with a pdf reader I decided to stop paying. So what happens with the money I paid a long time ago? Do I need to pay monthly?",
            "It was dumb of me to rate this app 4 stars, specially when most of then times I try to share my work on Google classroom, it shows a blank class which frustrates me. The ads are annoying and also the sharing is so slow, it buffers for 5 minutes, and no, my WiFi Isn't the problem here. Don't use this app specifically when you are sending work last minute, it delays you.",
            "I did not upgrade so I guess I am way ahead of the game, I still have a very usable cam scanner. However, yesterday I tried to use the scanner that I have used for so many years and it simply would not allow me to go through the program to a finished downloadable product. Constantly asking me to subscribe. I have given up. It allows a download for free but it can not be used for free. No more for me. I will find something else.",
            "It's like having acrobat, printer, pdf creator, microsoft picture manger in one. Super easy to just click the high qualitypic of the document/ card/qr code etc. and customize it if you want, send in as a jpg or pdf reduce size and share via different platforms like Gmail/ messages/ fb etc.. all these in less than a minute..",
            "Too expensive. I use this app occasionally for scanning documents. Wanted to support the developer and buy a \"Pro\" version. Turns out that Premium is $50 bucks a year! No way! So instead of receiving a reasonable payment of, say, $4.99 (which is what they should be charging) they get nothing. Oh well! ‚òπÔ∏è"

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nIf you like this app, please share it with other doctors.

Doesn't require to take photo with flashlight and outline the area of the mole like in others so-called \"AI diagnosing apps\". Overall this is by far the best AI melanoma diagnosing tool I've tried, that really looks like AI.",

The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Works perfectly as advertised, it's a lifesaver. I will say the adapter on the end is as cheap as they come and broke almost instantly with light use on the first day. I bought a better quality adapter elsewhere and it works perfectly now. My only other complaint is that the \"current UV index\" function never loads no matter where I am. I can just look that up elsewhere though so it's not a big deal and would've been a nice perk more than anything. I'm on a samsung Galaxy s8+.",
            "Does not even *not* work consistently. Fluctuates between showing the image and not detecting the camera. Very frustrating experience. Obviously very shaky programming.",
            "It doesn't work! I tried this on 2 phones, galaxy note 4 & 8. It keeps asking me to allow it to connect to my camera. But there is no option to give permission to connect to camera available. Only for mic & location. Disappointed.",
            "It works! I honestly don't get the hate this app is receiving. Firstly, you need to BUY the product called \"Sunscreenr\", its an external mini-camera that's attached to your phone via the USB-C/B (whatever your phone supports) cable. Secondly, you have to use it in sunlight üåû..!! No sun = No UV = Camera and App wont work. I bought the mini-camera and took pictures in the morning eith my sunscreen on. This thing works!!",
            "I just received my unit (2019-04-25) and successfully downloaded the app, connected the camera, and used it to take an initial pair of images showing before/after applying sunscreen.  It worked GREAT!  Pretty much just like in the pictures.  I'm using an old Samsung Galaxy S4 and had no problems whatsoever.  I have not explored any of the other app features other than pushing the picture taking button.  I am NOT associated with the company behind this device;  I am a true, honest, unpaid consumer that is satisfied & impressed."

            "I like this app, it's the best scanner and really easy to organise. I didn't give full stars because there isn't an option to edit the name, or edit the documents. Like scan a few more, or delete a few once you have saved it onto the device. If I make a mistake I have to rescan everything. Nonetheless, I am still using this app because there are no ads and it's a quality scanner!",
            "It's a nice app, especially if you have an outlook account. When you save it, it saves directly to your account after you log in once, and you can also choose what to save it as (pdf, jpeg, etc. . .). The only thing is, if you have bad lighting, sometimes the scanner won't pick up the edges of your paper. Which is a given for any scanner, but if you're in a rush it can cost you time. It doesn't have pop up ads like some other scanners I've used so that's also a plus.",
            "This is an amzing app. If we click a photo for scanning from any angle, it automatically makes the photo clear and straight. I could have given 5 stars to this app, if there could be one more feature in it. Today I had to scan the images of my test paper and by mistake, I forgot one page to scan. So I scanned it at the last thinking that *there will be an option to reorder the pages in a correct format*. But I wasnt able to reorder. Please add page reordering feature in this app. Thank you.üòä",

Works just fine and captures the document from whichever angle I click. Only one thing, today I forgot to rename the file before saving it. And then I couldn't find any option to rename it. So I had to click the pictures of the pages again. If there is a renaming option, please help me find it but if not, that's an improvement you must make."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. üò≠",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

Dividing the breast into four parts, we observe that the most ducts are located in the upper external quadrant of the breast (close to the armpits). It is in this location where most of the malignant tumors of the breast take place (50%). The breast contains a variable number of lobules, between 10 and 20, and a few milk excretory ducts that flow into the nipple. These lobules are responsible for producing breast milk. With the self-exam you will learn to know the normal structure of your breasts and you will be able to discover any future anomaly that may appear. 95% of breast cancer cases can be cured, as long as they are detected in time.\r\n\r\nThe innovative factor of the glove is the increase in the sensitivity of the fingers that oscillates between 3 to 8 times, due to the combination of the material used for its production and the special oil between the two layers that form it. Its effectiveness has been tested in the Department of Biotechnology of the University of Alicante.\r\nThe study was performed with microspheres between 0.04 and 1.40 millimeters.\r\nBetween 93.2% (right hand) and 100% (left hand) of the cases the sensitivity of touch increased 3.3 times.\r\nBetween 53.3% (right hand) and 67% (left hand) of the cases the sensitivity of touch increased 6.6 times.\r\nBetween 20 % (right hand) and 14% (left hand) of the cases the sensitivity of touch increased 8.3 times.\r\nAnother conclusion that was obtained from the result was that the smaller the size of the particle, the greater the capacity of the Sensifemme glove to magnify the tactile sensitivity, which makes it very appropriate for the early detection of small lumps in the breasts.\r\nRisk factors: \r\nSex: It occurs mainly in women. It can also affect men although the probability is minimal.\r\nAge: 60% of breast cancers occur in women over 60 and the remaining 40% in younger women.\r\nGenes: There are 2 genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, that when mutated can cause the appearance of breast cancer.\r\nFamily history: When a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter) has had breast cancer, the risk of suffering from it is doubled. If it is a more distant relative (grandmother, aunt or cousin), the risk increases only slightly.\r\nMenstrual periods: The sooner menstruation begins (before the age of 12), the greater the risk of suffering from breast cancer, when compared to those that started later. Women with late menopause (after the age of 55) have a higher risk.\r\nLifestyle: Alcohol abuse, smoking, obesity, etc. increase the risk of breast cancer.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Sensifemme:\r\nIncreases touch sensitivity, allowing you to detect more quickly and more accurately any unknown formation, including lumps the size of a pinhead or a grain of sugar. In the case of breast cancer, its early diagnosis increases considerably the probability of cure.\r\nIt facilitates a more uniform palpation without resistance or friction that may affect the touch.\r\nIt magnifies the perception of the breast tissues.\r\nIt allows for a more effective and simple self-diagnosis, within the privacy of the home.\r\nIt detects more accurately changes in the skin or chest structure.\r\nIt is especially useful when touching with the fingers is painful.\r\n\r\nIf you have any doubt about how to carry out the technique, do not hesitate to consult your doctor, gynecologist and/or nurse.",

        "description": "Sunburn is a form of radiation burn that affects living tissue, such as skin, that results from an overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, commonly from the sun. Common symptoms in humans and other animals include red or reddish skin that is hot to the touch, pain, general fatigue, and mild dizziness. An excess of UV radiation can be life-threatening in extreme cases. Exposure of the skin to lesser amounts of UV radiation will often produce a suntan. Excessive UV radiation is the leading cause of primarily non-malignant skin tumors. Sunscreen is widely agreed to prevent sunburn and some types of skin cancer. Clothing, including hats, is considered the preferred skin protection method. Moderate sun tanning without burning can also prevent subsequent sunburn, as it increases the amount of melanin, a photoprotective pigment that is the skin's natural defense against overexposure. Importantly, both sunburn and the increase in melanin production are triggered by direct DNA damage. When the skin cells' DNA is overly damaged by UV radiation, type I cell-death is triggered and the skin is replaced.",

Helps in coping with realities and learn how to make the best of our wonderful gift of life. I assume most who download this app will be focusing on one particular area. Something IMPORTANT to remember is disease can become your friend, teacher and companion. May we NEVER FORGET when faced with disease that it is \"GOD who DECIDES\".",

        "description": "The SkinScreen application extends human capabilities in the detection and classification of skin lesions/skin cancer in the support value-based healthcare goals. SkinScreen offers the capability to detect malignant and benign skin lesions in real-time through a highly accurate and precise solution. The solution leverages the power of deep learning, a method under artificial intelligence (AI), to allow quicker and more accurate predictions than previously were available. Through a term that we have trademarked, called Indescribable Model, it is an AI model that is seeded with hyperparameters initially however the model continually trains itself in finding the best fit against the dataset without any future human intervention required. Currently, the detection is manually performed by a dermatologist or technician through a heuristic approach known as ABCDE (Asymmetry, Border Irregularity, Color, Diameter, Evolution).\r\n\r\nSkinScreen offers a number of differences than other solutions in the market:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure user privacy - By leveraging the latest MobileNetV2 architecture the AI model is able to run on a user's device and no images need to be uploaded back to SkinScreen's servers unlike other solutions.\r\n\r\n2. Detect whether a skin lesion is present - Many AI skin detection solutions do not detect whether a skin lesion is present in the image initially. They rely upon manual intervention by the human user to provide a skin lesion image. For example, if a user provides an image of a giraffe their solutions will classify the image regardless. SkinScreen's sophisticated AI model is able detect whether a skin lesion is present prior to classification.\r\n\r\n3. Detect more classes of skin lesions - By detecting 9 common benign and malignant classes of skin lesions  (Actinic Keratoses, Angioma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanocytic nevus, Melanoma, Seborrheic keratoses, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Vascular lesions)we are able provide better feedback for each individual who interfaces with SkinScreen. And we are continuing to expand the number of skin lesion classes that we support.\r\n\r\n4. Provide higher accuracy and precision rates - We are leveraging a two-fold approach to accomplish the higher accuracy and precision rates. We first use a one-class classifier to identify whether a skin lesion is present in the image. If so, then we are able to provide back the 3 most likely skin lesion classes and their associated probabilities. Part of this is accomplished through the 180,000 images that we use to train our AI model.\r\n\r\n5. Provide real-time feedback - SkinScreen is able to provide back results to the user in under two seconds on average. By leveraging MobileNetV2 architecture which has lower latency and higher accuracy and few proprietary enhancements we are able to notify the user of the results in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n6. Provide user-friendly tools - SkinScreen's different platforms are able to assist users in their interactions with the tool. We try to accomplish this through support tools that are imperative in detecting skin lesions regardless of the user's background and skill sets.",

Chez l‚Äôhomme, les cancers les plus fr√©quents sont : le cancer de la prostate, du poumon et du c√¥lon ; chez la femme, ce sont : le cancer du sein, du c√¥lon et celui du poumon. \r\n\r\nBien manger r√©duit non seulement le risque de d√©velopper un cancer mais l'adjonction d'aliments dits \"anti cancer\" fournit une aide extraordinaire aux cellules de notre corps pour combattre les inflammations et le d√©veloppement de cellules canc√©reuses.\r\n\r\nLe cancer peut toucher tous les organes. Il est d√ª √† la multiplication non contr√¥l√©e et la mutation de cellules du corps qui finissent par former une tumeur. \r\n\r\nLe plus souvent la cause est inconnue. Mais certains cancers ont des causes pr√©cises : une forte exposition au soleil pour le m√©lanome, √† l‚Äôamiante pour le cancer de la pl√®vre, le tabagisme pour le cancer du poumon‚Ä¶ \r\n\r\nNon d√©truites, ces cellules canc√©reuses peuvent envahir d‚Äôautres organes. On parle alors de m√©tastases. Si le cancer s‚Äô√©tend √† plusieurs organes, il s‚Äôagit d‚Äôun cancer g√©n√©ralis√©. \r\n\r\nLe nombre de cancers d√©tect√©s augmente gr√¢ce au perfectionnement des techniques de d√©pistage ce qui permet une prise en charge plus rapide et de plus grandes chances de gu√©rison.\r\n\r\nLe plus souvent les sympt√¥mes d‚Äôun cancer sont inexistants. Mais on peut observer : \r\n- Une toux persistante, du sang dans les crachats (cancer du poumon)\r\n- Une voix inhabituellement rauque (cancer de la gorge ou du poumon)\r\n- Des probl√®mes digestifs persistants (cancer colorectal ou du pancr√©as)\r\n- Des difficult√©s √† avaler (cancer de l‚Äô≈ìsophage)\r\n- Une modification du transit : diarrh√©e, constipation, sang dans les selles (cancer colorectal)\r\n- Du sang dans les urines (cancer du rein ou de la vessie)\r\n- Une grosseur inhabituelle dans le sein (cancer du sein)\r\n\r\nUne palpation, une analyse de sang, une √©chographie, une radio ou une IRM peuvent permettre de d√©celer une tumeur. Pour poser le diagnostic une biopsie est n√©cessaire. \r\n\r\nPour pr√©venir un cancer il faut:\r\n\r\n- Avoir une alimentation vari√©e et √©quilibr√©e\r\n- Pratiquer une activit√© physique r√©guli√®re\r\n- Ne pas fumer ni consommer trop d‚Äôalcool\r\n- Perdre du poids si vous √™tes en surpoids\r\n\r\nLe cancer est le mal du si√®cle. Avoir une bonne hygi√®ne de vie permet d'en r√©duire les risques, notamment par une alimentation √©quilibr√©e et vari√©e. De nombreux aliments poss√®dent des vertus anticancer. L'ail en fait partie, tout comme l'oignon, l'√©chalote ou la ciboulette, pour ne citer qu'eux, cette application vous propose de d√©couvrir les aliments de lutte contre le cancer, ainsi que des recommandations alimentaires bien adapt√©s concernant autant les personnes qui souhaitent pr√©venir le cancer que celles qui en sont atteintes ou qui souhaitent √©viter une r√©cidive.",

Si le cancer s‚Äô√©tend √† plusieurs organes, il s‚Äôagit d‚Äôun cancer g√©n√©ralis√©. <br><br>Le nombre de cancers d√©tect√©s augmente gr√¢ce au perfectionnement des techniques de d√©pistage ce qui permet une prise en charge plus rapide et de plus grandes chances de gu√©rison.<br><br>Le plus souvent les sympt√¥mes d‚Äôun cancer sont inexistants. Mais on peut observer : <br>- Une toux persistante, du sang dans les crachats (cancer du poumon)<br>- Une voix inhabituellement rauque (cancer de la gorge ou du poumon)<br>- Des probl√®mes digestifs persistants (cancer colorectal ou du pancr√©as)<br>- Des difficult√©s √† avaler (cancer de l‚Äô≈ìsophage)<br>- Une modification du transit : diarrh√©e, constipation, sang dans les selles (cancer colorectal)<br>- Du sang dans les urines (cancer du rein ou de la vessie)<br>- Une grosseur inhabituelle dans le sein (cancer du sein)<br><br>Une palpation, une analyse de sang, une √©chographie, une radio ou une IRM peuvent permettre de d√©celer une tumeur. Pour poser le diagnostic une biopsie est n√©cessaire. <br><br>Pour pr√©venir un cancer il faut:<br><br>- Avoir une alimentation vari√©e et √©quilibr√©e<br>- Pratiquer une activit√© physique r√©guli√®re<br>- Ne pas fumer ni consommer trop d‚Äôalcool<br>- Perdre du poids si vous √™tes en surpoids<br><br>Le cancer est le mal du si√®cle. Avoir une bonne hygi√®ne de vie permet d&#39;en r√©duire les risques, notamment par une alimentation √©quilibr√©e et vari√©e. De nombreux aliments poss√®dent des vertus anticancer. L&#39;ail en fait partie, tout comme l&#39;oignon, l&#39;√©chalote ou la ciboulette, pour ne citer qu&#39;eux, cette application vous propose de d√©couvrir les aliments de lutte contre le cancer, ainsi que des recommandations alimentaires bien adapt√©s concernant autant les personnes qui souhaitent pr√©venir le cancer que celles qui en sont atteintes ou qui souhaitent √©viter une r√©cidive.",

            "Very fun game, but insanely expensive. Want to play single player? You have to pay for it. Want to upgrade your multi-player? You have to pay for it. Then there's the battle pass, premium pass, and thats not even getting to the pop ups after every game spamming you about other deals you can buy. The devs have something here, for the 1%.",
            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",
            "The game was great. Addictive. I am free player and been able to reach to lvl16 but the pain is to constantly watching ads. I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack. But still lots of fun. However this is definitely a pay to win game. Want you obtained Max rank all your characters you cannot continue to advance the upgrades without spending money"

            "I really have nothing else to say. The app is a lost cause. I made a point many years ago when the app was first launched about the app kept messing up the syncing process between the quantity or record of a wine entry with the record at the database server. This problem was never fixed! Today I found the same error with the quantity of a wine I have just couple days ago, and I found the quantity of the wine was unchanged. Can u trust a tech company can't even get its database syncing right?",
            "This should allow two ratings. For looking up wines and getting descriptions and reviews, this app is great. You can even take a photo of the label and most of the time it'll find it. This has kept me away from accidentally buying sweet wines (not my gig). Love it for this use. Then I used Vivino for ordering wine - I have done it twice. Once the order was placed and weeks later it didn't ship. No notice why or if it would be shipped. Cancelled that. Later I tried again, ordering a case of one of my go-to wines from a different sub-retailer in Vivino. The order was shipped in a very reasonable time this order, but upon opening it they had substituted for the entire case with a different wine. No warning, just did it. Were it one bottle, I would be (only) ok with this, but for a case, without warning, this is unacceptable. The thing that has ended my ordering on Vivino is that, having had this happen, I can't get Vivino to even answer an email or respond to the 'contact' tab on their site. I frankly don't know if anyone works there anymore, certainly nobody is manning the email address or contact input. I have reached out both ways for the third time today and will be calling the credit card to have the charges reversed.",
            "Why only 4 stars?! The application is good, pretty sure I'll use it for several times, but the 1st thing I noticed, that the tutorial after the \"see how it works\" button is completely unreadable (at least for me it is..). Light brownish background with small grey text. Please take into consideration to change it. :)",
            "Love it and recommend it often. It's a great way to broaden your palette. I've tried so many new wines based on a decent rating and generally been happy I did. Also helped me to avoid a few bad ones.",
            "Used to be a good app, but now it's just annoying when it takes over your screen to install a non-existent update, that usually comes along a week after the first red screen appears. Suggestions to remove the annoyance have gone unheard (contacted via the app)"

            "Fair warning- these guys are Grade A scammers. You know what's not fun? Rushing to turn in a paper only to have the scanning app you've been using without issues suddenly lock, with no warning, unless you pay them 20 dollars, just casually holding you hostage. In a panic, you fork over 20 dollars because what else are you gonna do? Anyway your paper ends up late, AND you're out 20 bucks. The kicker? They then ask you to rate the app. The only clickable option? 5 stars. These guys are dirtbags.",

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.üëà",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "Is this a joke? You put free in title and give only 3 days free and ask to pay. I don't mind you asking for price but instead you put it on the free store and asking to pay after download. Move your app to the paid store. Edit : Google asks for adding cards to get paid automatically after 3 days. Bug or intended I don't know.",
            "I liked the app very much. But for some reason, after cropping and aligning it outputs files of very poor quality (low resolution and extreme compression artifacts), which makes them barely readable at times, even though I have put the quality options for both images and PDFs all the way to the max in the app settings and my input files are high res sharp photos. Do I have to purchase the app in order to get a good output quality?",

        "description": "Although small amounts of UV radiation are beneficial to health, overexposure can lead to skin cancer. The main determinant of UVI is the sun's elevation angle. UVI values are thus greatest in the summer, especially near solar noon. At mid-latitudes, peak UVI can reach summer peak values greater than 10, but in winter, the UVI values are generally less than 1. Peak UVI values can exceed 20 in the tropics, where seasonal variations are much smaller. The highest values in the world occur in the high altitude altiplano region of Peru, where they can exceed UVI=25.\r\n \r\nThis app provides information about the current UVI and how it will vary throughout the day at any location. Sites can be selected by three methods: (1) GPS, (2) Drop-down menu of over 300 preloaded sites, (3) selection by touching the global map, using sliders to fine tune. Your own favourite locations can be specified and stored.\r\n \r\nThe app uses (a) daily ozone forecast maps provided by NOAA, (b) solar zenith angles calculated from location and time, (c) a look-up table to calculate the clear sky UVI as a function of ozone and solar zenith angle (SZA), (d) a digital elevation map to allow altitude corrections at other locations, (e) climatology of aerosol optical depth, (f) estimates of cloud effects at noon, and a (g) climatology map of monthly mean ozone as a function of latitude for estimating UV at other times.\r\n \r\nThe clear-sky UVI is first calculated for sea-level, assuming an Earth-Sun separation of 1 AU. Corrections are then applied to account for seasonal differences in Sun-Earth separation, altitude (including corrections to albedo due to estimated snow cover), and the climatological mean aerosol optical depth, and cloud effects for each location.\r\nInitial outputs (portrait mode) are the calculated clear sky and UVI at the current time, and the time and value of peak UVI expected that day, along with behavioural messages that depend on the skin type entered. A world map shows the selected location and the current pattern of UVI for UVI > 3.\r\n \r\nThe second screen (landscape mode) goes into more detail, show plots of the progression in UVI throughout the day, with accompanying behavioural messages. The app displays parameters relevant to the calculation of UVI, and allows the capability to alter some of them to allow for local conditions, such as snow cover, heavier than usual pollution, or whether the sun is obscured by clouds.\r\n \r\nThe app includes a capability of estimating UVI at any location for other seasons. This is achieved by making use of a monthly climatology of ozone rather than the forecast values for the present day. This capability allows users to plan timing of visits to other destinations, or events at other locations. The UVI can be shown in Solar Time (longitude), Phone Time (at the current location), or GMT.\r\n \r\nAcknowledgements: The app was developed by JGR Burke (jgrburke@gmail.com) in consultation with Dr Richard McKenzie, NIWA, Lauder, NZ.

            "Hi. I have been using this app for 3 months now. Excellent app. I will definitely suggest the app. Working interface is good. And easy to use. I lost 4kgs in 1 month. How ? I have followed advance level workouts. I was in an intermittent fasting . And I stopped consuming any kind of sugars, Added sugars. 5 litter water every day. I am proud of myself. Thanks leap fitness. You guys can also do the same . Believe in yourself. And workout hard üí™.good luck",
            "It is the best app for the people who want to lose body weight , I installed it and i saw results instantaniously. It keeps track of every thing like body weight each and every day it remindes me of drinking water and exercise. it only takes 20 minutes every morning to exercise. Only problem is ads the pop up when ever you close the app.",
            "This is a pretty good app and i have used it multiple times so it has progressed very far. I find the animations nice but it would be better if you could see it with one extra perspective because before these wprkouts i have to check how to do each one beforehand. And ad placements have become much better so atleast i wont have an ad between a workout. Keep up the good work",
            "I'm surprised. The Lose Weight App offers a decent workout routine. I've actually conducted military physical training on a daily basis for the last 17 years. This app is just as effective for a QUICK workout as long as you DO THE EXERCISES CORRECTLY. Don't cheat your body; take the appropriate break the app gives you, always do the full count or more and try to beat your record on timed exercises. If you do it right without skipping days you'll see results."

            "It's one of the best dress up apps out there, there's plenty of items and (so far) there doesn't seem to be a limit on saved dolls. It would be cool if they added a way to sort your characters into folders of sorts so that it's easier to find a character you're looking for. Edit: After the last update I started getting adds on the top and bottom of my screen again even though I previously paid to remove them. Down to three stars until this is resolved.",
            "Oh my!This game is F.A.B,I just really adore the details!YOUR GRAPHICS ARE REAAAAALLY GOODüëç!!! I hope my reccomendations help!: Pls add the ability to choose earings,neclaces,sleeves,shirts,pants etc. and i hope we can change the colors! I want more eye designs and be able to color them+They can blink! If we could add like animations that make the hair look like its flying by the wind it would be cool! üòÆ add poses and i wanna be able to make stories with this app,anything pls! #SORECOMMENDED!",
            "I really enjoy this app! It's fun, creative, and has beautiful music.There are only 2 things it's missing: 1: if you could change the colours on everything (eyes, clothes, shoes ect.) that would be great! 2: it would be fab if you could put your chibi doll in different poses, as I think the regular standing pose is a bit boring.",
            "This game is very fun it is amazing it's a creating a character it's just like God's club but very different than go to club I love it so much I love how you can like change the look of your characters so much but I wish they would add somewhere that you can makeup a name for your character but it is very fun it's a very creative fashionable game well not that fashionable üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Well download it if you haven't",
            "Great game so awesome game 8 year old girl so good I recommend you make more games like this ... I'm a fan of MLP my little pony .. I made a mlp chibi dolls so great hope you upgrade .. the game ..or make more like this game.. üòÄüòÉüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç......"

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "Excellent app, many features and options, uniquely has dual panes, invaluable for organising files. Dual pane feature oddly disappeared a few weeks ago, but reinstated on new version - thanks Michal for very quick response to support query!",
            "This has been my choice for best Android file manager for a long time. Great interface and amazing capabilities - can manipulate local, LAN, FTP, DNLA, and web-based files - pretty much anywhere you choose. I have used this app for some time on an unrooted Pixel 3, running Android 10, with great results. If it worked on Android 11, I'd give it a full 5 stars... however... The latest Android (11) update broke the file manager's ability (which worked fine in Android 10) to access (see or modify) anything in the InternalSharedStorage/Android/data folder (and others, I believe) - where Android apps store their data and files - at least on my unrooted phone. So, I'm no longer able to copy/delete/edit or even see files in the directory(-ies) whose permissions have apparently changed with the update. I understand that the developers of this app are not at fault here - that's clearly Google's screw up, but it definitely affects the suitability of the app for some uses, and users would want to know. In any case, if and when Google unscrews the pooch or the app developers can somehow overcome the issue, I'll com back and give the app the 5-stars that it would warrant. I'll send the developers a beer, via the app, since I had to dock them a star because of Google's mistake.",
            "This Android file browser has been perfected over the years, making it practically perfect: an excellent interface, with well-placed buttons, fast in usage, and extensive support for dlna, usb, wifi and cloud storage. Nothing comes closer to a full-fledged desktop-experience. For a $3 donation you get some nice bonus features. Give the man some $! Thank you, maker.",
            "Very interesting, indeed. I dont understand it and need somebody to help me understand this app and the process of it and what is the intent. Clever you are. Brilliant. So i like this app and been playing with it about apk files to the zip files. And now i guess im gonna do the tasker next with wifi. But why though? Why does this app need my wifi for. I really like it and been really busy with the app its fun but what are suppose to be doing"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Used to be good. But the non stop ads with annoying loud noise everytime you open an image is unbelievably a waste of time. Its non stop and continuous. Uninstalled. Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this oneüò™",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",
            "Just bought the Moto g 5G plus however the app crashes every time when I zoom out the rear camera with ultra-wide and it asks me to restart the camera......is it the problem with the app or the new phone which just opened today",
            "What's the use of hardware if your are not having a perfect optimised software ? Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos. All previous generation moto camera where doing a great job than this why this you have done for motorola fusion plus please rectify asap..."

            "Always easy to use and very helpful tips and things in the app. Also very easy to contact if you need to but you can find the answer to almost anything you need right am the cricket app. Super easy to change plans and features and it gives you the option to start changes today or at next billing cycle which I love. I have loved the cricket experience so far and I've been a customer for about six months now and would recommend anyone with a contract to think about switching. Low monthly plans.",
            "EDITED Review: Initially it worked great. Five dollars off with auto pay via app. Cool, ty. Then it started saying my debit card wasnt up to date (its 2 months old) when all was correct. To pay over the phone or in person there is a \"customer service\" fee. So between the 5 I would get from auto pay savings and the fee I pay 10 additional dollars per month because of this faulty app. Essentially I have been repaying 1/3 of my bill due to their error.",
            "Data stinks and my phone slows to fast and I have access unlimited data. U can't even get a new phone. I rather go to simply mobile or metro pcs. The phone I bought was from rent a center years ago, it's a Samsung galaxy J7(2016) version. So it's not a cricket model, I haven't had a cricket phone since several years because I was having problems with every phone. Metro will let you get a free phone for Switching. I'm on a very tight budget and fixed income.",
            "Besides the fact that the app sometimes won't work. There is the issue that when you have a phone that's not working it's hard to get in contact with anyone. I've even tried the customer service line for my cell phone. But without being able to review the items that we purchase through cricket, they aren't really able to know when a company is providing crappy product. I've also had an issue with the last two devices that I've purchased not being able to connect to wifi!",
            "Their websites don't work, their app doesn't work! Made faithful payments for over four years. Missed my payment on the 1st But it wasn't due till the 2nd. Tried to make payments all day on the 2nd and couldn't get through. Then I get charged $15 because I make the payment 9 hours late the day after. When you called to complain the manager will just hang up on you! Even if you don't swear! Worst company! Most of them don't understand English!"

I honestly dont mind the ads, most of the time they're just skip able pictures unlike other apps with 30 second non-skip able clips. Thank you for making this app! üíù",

About a month later I reinstall it and after another 15 uses the same thing happened. I have to keep reinstalling it because when I choose the file it closes every one in a while . But it gets another star from last time I used it.",
            "Background Eraser is a great app! if you use the auto setting while erasing you can very easily erase the backround of a photo. but there is a downside, for some reason the adds that pop up are too big and I can't click off them, and the only way is to get off the add, is to close the app and restart. Is there anyway to fix this?",
            "Its really good! I love how its really easy and has the right tools for me,( im sorry if i dont spell right its my broken keybored) but theres one problem, when im done removing the background for a video, it just kicks me out. And also the ads, there are to many, ( sorry if im annoying) but i love ghe app so far! Keep up to work! :3",
            "Its good but there is to many ads,i would give it a 4 but theres way to many ads please fix the ads problem,but if it doesnt i might have to give it a 2 or a 1 if this gets better i will give it a 5 or either a 4 star that is all,but other than that its nice ..just please fix it"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "This game is really fun I have been playing it for a while and I love it. You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwUü•∞ü§©",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as photophobia, nystagmus, and amblyopia. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers. In rare cases such as Ch√©diak‚ÄìHigashi syndrome, albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules. This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection. Albinism results from inheritance of recessive gene alleles and is known to affect all vertebrates, including humans.

            "There is no doubt that the Muslim Pro App is a fantastic application and it is the best of its type. I consult it every day as it is very useful to me in communicating with my Creator. May Allah reward the Developers adequately, Aameen. However I wish to inform you that whenever an update is received, downloaded and installed on the Muslim Pro App, all information on the Birthday section on the Calendar is wiped out. Please what can be done to keep the information intact.",
            "Very good app, however i preferred the previous version's method of marking verses as read. Now I have to click the three dots to mark each verse as read and to save progress. Very tedious for each verse. Edit: They have not changed the Quran system and did not even respond to my email regarding this issue. Very unprofessional and arrogant.",
            "My lifetime premium version had worked very well so far but today It does not work at all on my huawei P30 Pro. Last android update. Please help. In addition, app on huawei app gallery canot be upgraded to premium version.. I will re-rate once I fixed. .................................................. Updated on 21 October 2020, it is working good right now.",
            "Alhamdulillah The Muslim Pro app is always reliable, and accurate. It is an excellent reminder to read the Qur'an, and have inspiration. Also there are plenty of ways within the app to connect to the community and now with the virtual Hajj journey it is a blessing. It also helps me with being on time, having the Adhan play for the obligatory prayers. Signing up for the lifetime membership is a sure way to always be connected.",
            "After I changed device..from asus max pro m1 to xiaomi redmi note 8 it gives error and I can't use my 1 year subscription...i try to subscribe with 1 month subscription..my money has been deducted but still..it gives error.. Update - 27/10/20 Syukur Alhamdulillah now everything goes back to normal.. Thank you for your response."

Dont make purchases into new stuff right away. all the too frequent release of new things are usually modified in some way shortly. no solo stuff, must team rally. If you dont plan to spend over $30k, focus style on things that let you benefit rally join",

Once i logged in my gf castle, she became able to read my conversation with everyone through her castle, now our relationship is going towards break up. Because of your unsafe chats. I also have my farms chats in my main castle. Correct this thing and save others. üò™",

            "overall pretty fun, but the app will not let me pay for the subscription. I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",
            "I love this app, I have been using it for at least two years and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable. BUT~~ I have notced that recently there are pictures showing up that are exact repeats of something I have already finished. That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone üò¢"

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",

I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",

Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.

But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

Some is poor advice, and some impossible to understand. Nothing to see here. No reason to read unless you get a little giggle out of broken English. Summing up the app, sunlight and smoking are bad for skin, and egg whites, castor oil and carrots have magical powers to eliminate wrinkles, but you might have to resort to botox. So silly. Five minutes worth of \"reading material\" at most."

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"
