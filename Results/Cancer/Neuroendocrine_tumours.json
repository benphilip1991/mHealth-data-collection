This is not 1993 and email sharing is not most convenient. 2. Sharing images is not an indication to skip a doctor. You are trying to cover product limitation with false concerns but is actually sounds patronising."

            "It's helpful to be able to access my records, including lab reports, in one secure place. O also like that I can send/receive messages, request refills, and use the portal for televisits. I have linked my Fitbit tracker to the site, so my daily exercise, sleep, and weight can be seen by my physician. The app is easy to use on my phone and laptop. Thank you!",
            "I wish I could give this zero stars.. Absurdly difficult to use. Terrible. Takes forever to set up. And when you get your own results there's no explanation of what they mean. Difficult to find anything. Slow. Very tiny font with poor contrast with background. Easier to just call and get results. Even if you have to wait 30 minutes. I HATE THIS APP! I HATE THIS APP!",
            "Several features do not work - cannot schedule appointment, limited devices support for health monitoring Syncing with external devices is very difficult or impossible due to limited devices - no sleep sync, no weight sync, no blood pressure sync, will not sync with Samsung Health app, not Samsung smartwatch - Active 2. Overall the app takes more time than it's worth to use. Do NOT Recommend this app. Tell your healthcare provider not to consider it for their patient access.",
            "To get to the waiting room, I had to go through the vitals entry screen first. I dont know my vitals when doing a televisit from home. I had to call to find out that you just leave them blank and go on through that screen to wait for provider to come on. Seems awkward and not obvious (user friendly) to me. Otherwise I love doing provider visits this way as I live 5 hours away from this specialist with no others near me.",
            "GREAT APP!!!! I really like having access to my records especially my med list, co-pays AND Medication Timers!!! I have used the Televisit option since the beginning of the year. It is very easy. I LOVE having the ability to have a Video appointment with my physician. Great App!!! I would give more stars if possible... Grateful in New Mexico"

            "I've been using this app for years! It is absolutely perfect in every way but there's still an issue that hasn't been fixed yet although it has been said before. I have more than 10 mood tracks that I track every day and whenever I try to send a PDF report of the month to my therapist it doesn't cover all of the moods that I track. It cuts many of them out. This has been a problem for me from the start and it's sad because i track many things that I just can't share in my therapy :/",
            "This app couldn't be more perfect. It is absolutely worth the purchase. Most mood apps are overwhelming and lacking, but this app does exactly what I want it to do - track bipolar moods, sleep, menstruation and weight, add custom items, export to CSV and more. It's a simple, versatile, no fluff format that takes less than a minute to fill out and I can even set a reminder so I don't forget. Seriously, thank you. This app is truly helpful for those with bipolar and other mood disorders.",
            "Love this app. Have tried several different apps to track mood and anxiety. The interface so easy to use. I love that I can add custom tracking points like energy, if I did exercise or pain levels. Graphs are nice and clear, easy for support staff to understand.",
            "Been using this for a couple weeks. It's been helpful in tracking my mood and compliance with medications. Also gives me a place to state any triggers or issues I encountered the day that have impacted my mood. My only gripe is the automatic backup being to Dropbox. I would prefer to be able to choose where these backups go to.",
            "A good tracking app, I have been using it for a year or so, just got the upgrade last week or so. I haven't had any issues until recently, when I tried pairing my Google Fit app. They have fixed my original issue (not seeing past graphs), but issue still remains about not displaying Google Fit data in their respective graphs. I am more anxious for the ability to pair Fitbit with this app (especially once all issues resolved around graphing)."

I just installed and so far it's a solid app. (BTW my background is in video game development so the bar is quite high.) The one section that caught my attention is [First aid techniques]. For example the: \"call triple zero (000)\" line makes sense since if you're in Australia, but it would add polish for users from other countries if you could use an auto detect (maybe IP?) to determine which country they're in, and swap out the text accordingly. Ditto for the CPR techniques. In the US the recommendation is now compression only CPR, so providing country specific instructions would be the icing on the cake! But all in all, solid, polished and well functioning app.",

I have been searching on google but, up till now, cannot find an answer. So beware of doing what i have done. Very easy to input health detail which would be critacle should I be taken I'll whilst away from home, it gave the option to be on the locked screen so that medics can know my problems, meds and contacts but without accessing my phone. Tried a couple, this was best by far.",

The tools the app uses to relieve anxiety are varied and appropriate to a variety of people. The app divides tools into different categories based on either active or reflective approaches, depending on a user’s preferences. All this combines with a colorful, almost whimsical user interface that is simultaneously easy to navigate and visually appealing and calming.",

            "I like the app because I have access to my medical records and tests. What I'm disappointed in, is the inability to make payments on this app. It is very frustrating to enter a your payment information but then do not have the option to continue or submit. Something is very wrong when your only option is to cancel or go back. Of course, if you go back all your payment info is removed and the Circle starts a over again. I have reported this on several occasions to billing to no avail.",
            "It's great when it works. But BSW will send forms for you to e-sign and they will not open through the app. The app also freezes from time to time and you have to hope and pray that it went through by logging out and logging back in and trying to finish the survey/questions a few times.....",
            "Very good app, great to have your history, medication list and pre-existing conditions in case of an emergency. Also appreciate being able to make appts completely thru the app, wonderful to have a complete list of your treating Doctors. Only improvement would be if I was able to use it from my home. Currently I have to get in my golf cart and drive 1 block to the lake where I get a strong signal.",
            "This has been the worst time I have ever had trying to get to a message sent to me by Baylor Scott and White. It has been nothing but confusion and incorrect information. What happened to the people who knew what was happening? I have never been so frustrated in my life! They sent me a message to read. I feel sure it has to do with my visit to Dr Thudi today and the appointment for a CT scan and a followup appt with him to get the results of the test. I am full of frustration of dealing No No",
            "Very easy to use and messaging medical staff is great. I get rapid responses. And it's nice to check test results with it."

As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration.

            "Noom puts the \"fun\" in \"functional\" plus it's easy to use! This app has short, informative articles that always make me chuckle. I lost weight right away during the 14-day trial, now I'm signed up for the next three months! This isn't like any other wellness app... you gotta try it for yourself to see just what I love about Noom. Totally worth it!!",
            "Originally thought I was getting my money's worth. But now they removed their built-in pedometer (which is the only device/app I was using) and they also removed the GPS tracking for when you do a workout and you want to know the distance you went (walk, hike, bike, etc). Very disappointed. I can't even accurately track my exercice anymore with this latest update they did! How am I supposed to figure out the distance I just hiked in order to punch it in manually? Ridiculous update.",
            "I absolutely love Noom! I've never had so much fun and success loosing weight! I love the tracking calories and seeing how many I have left, all the information they give you every day and the fun way they explain it, the coach, the group interaction! This is for me. I'm going to sign up my daughter too. I've only lost 9 pounds so far, but I know I'll stick with it and loose the rest ( unlike other diets) because I'm really enjoying it and learning so much. I love Noom!",
            "I absolutely love this! You learn how to eat better, and eat less. Noom helps you to be accountable for everything from nutrition to fitness! It is also motivational and you have a personal coach to help you along the way. You set realistic long term and short term goals for yourself. One thing that surprised me was I've always been a healthy eater, but with noom I realized I was eating way too dense. So far Ive lost 5 lbs and its the first week! If you put in the work, youll see results!",
            "So far mostly ok. Two main complaints: 1. Step tracking. Originally I set it up to sync with Fitbit and adjust goals daily, but it wasn't working so I tried to remove the link to Fitbit but now it only lets me choose a different app. I just want to log steps manually. 2. Why do they have you add on a meal plan and exercise plan but NOT have those integrated into the app? If I'd known in advance these would be just emailed to me and not really part of the program I wouldn't have gotten them."

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game.

Also,though the music controller is handy, some tweaks would be nice. I would like to see the song title/artist on screen, be able to keep the screen on and locked on the page i want so i dont have to find it each time, maybe a time display in the corner of other pages. The fitness modes do seem to read a lot of useful info, but i havent tested them much.",

There is no option to take a picture, and it cannot open any images from my phone. I wish they could update it so it would work with my LG phone. Other than that, the app works great for me. Edit: I would also love if the local weather was added to the app and would show on the watch. That would make this the perfect app.",
            "It's okay, but the sleep tracker starts tracking me at midnight no matter what time I go to bed, if that doesn't work what's the point of any of the sleep stuff? Running tracks fine, but there is no way to activate the route tracking from the watch, which is also silly. It's also pretty light on \"goal\" options either than just setting your steps and corresponding calories. One certainly gets what they pay for here",

Thankfully Centr takes care of all the planning and tells you EXACTLY what to do and how to do it with an incredibly easy to use interface. They even get your kids involved with some of the activities. I've been at it 30 days now and def notice an improvement in muscle gain and overall health.",

I only wish that this app would track your weight and do some before and after photos. Or it could definitely make some monthly or weekly progress notifications. Other than that. This app is definitely great. 👍",

I love that you can see how long the workout is and for many of the programs, you can see what exercises yoy will be doing ahead of time. Includes recipes too. Great value.",

            "This app has great workouts and I have found the coached workouts are easy to follow. The recipes are fairly easy to follow and its improved my breakfast game. The reason it doesn't get five stars is because it's really lacking in personalization. It doesn't help you tract your weight or personalize the meal plan to your height/weight/gender/activity level. As is, the meal plan portion of the app is highly lacking for what you pay for the app. I do really love the workouts though."

            "A good app for very basic, grounded challenges people with simple lives might face. It's very lacking, however, when it comes to greater, more complex, interconnected challenges. At its core it assumes changing thinking or taking certain action will improve things, but that isn't always true. It's for mainstream issues. If you have some self-mastery, you'll need a better app, or this one will need upgrading. Many of the default options only scratch the surface. Great for teenagers/young adults.",
            "This apps discusses the social anxiety disorder in great depth. It really works!",
            "Unable to get anywhere.. the App won't download ~ this is worsening my anxiety.",
            "This app is helpful for anyone because everyone gets anxious and often don't know how to deal with it well. This app gives you the tools to do that. You can label how you feel, explain why you feel that way, learn ways to reframe your thoughts using the coping cards and so much more. I haven't been using this for long, but I have a feeling this will change your life for the better if you using it regularly and take advantage of the resources on this app.",
            "It started well, but today I faced the same issue as others: my checkins and experiences were removed 4 days in the past, and I only made summaries once a day. That was the most useful feature for me. Bummer."

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

Only used it for a couple days but seems really good so far. Love the kind of \"social media stories\" layout think it works well apart from it goes back instead of forward quite often when tapping near the middle. Thank you!",
            "Impressive, clarifying and insightful. This app is beautifully designed (not just visually, but also from a user design perspective). It's easy, small little tasks that are done in 2/3 minutes and give you a bit more insight or help you when your head is racing because of... F.e. stress. Give it a try. It's quite unbelievable it's free. I would love to pay a one time sum of money / small donation to use it!",
            "Its been excellent so far. Not invasive, but still gives me incentive to go back to it. I like the way things are paced, and i've surprisingly really enjoyed the journaling feature (something I was pretty sure I was going to use exactly zero times unless forced). All in all just a calm space that i can go to once or twice a day to reflect and try to better myself a bit. Easily recommended.",
            "This app was so wonderful! Compared to other apps which have limited things for free, this app has everything you need for FREE!! It has so many rescue sessions that help me so much! Every 3-4 days there are check-ins, and I definitely don't regret installing this app!! Sometimes the page takes a long time to load. But overall I LOVE this app and definitely reccomend it!!",
            "Just wow... I've used apps making similar claims, usually disappointed in what I experience; ads constantly or gimmicky content locked behind Premium version. Not so with Intellect! It's free and ad free but more than that, it actually does what it claims. This app has and continues to help me immensely and I am going to say the craziest thing but, I'd like to pay for it! It's rare to find such value and I highly recommend Intellect to everyone. We all have things to improve. Thank you so much!"

It's so visual and simple to utilize + catches to add to your veggies, action, rest and so forth. The charts are useful as well and weight health tracker.

            "I have been lazy so far, telling myself that it takes a lot of time to workout. But with the introduction to this app, it has made my life so easy! 7 minutes and I feel super strong. I have only been using it for a week, and I can already see the difference in my body. I'm much more active, AND I'm getting the required workout in just under 10 minutes! That's everything we require in this fast paced world ♥️✨ 5 stars because it's super easy to use, with clear instructions! Thank a lot!!",
            "\"7 MINUTE WORKOUT requires one or more Google Play services that are not currently available. Please contact the developer for assistance.\" I was trying to connect it to Google Fit, but no luck. It is not registering my progress to Fit. I like Google Fit and I found your application to be quite good. I would be really grateful if you could tell me of a workaround or a resolution for this matter. In case you cannot solve the progress transfer from this to Fit, please give a detailed reason.",
            "This app is helping me stay fit. In this fast paced world, where we struggle to get some quality time to invest in our health & wellbeing, this 7 minute workout is a blessing, to say the least. As the app claims, I believe it truly gives you \"maximum result with minimal investment (of time)\". I would highly recommend this app to anyone who desires to stay fit & healthy!",
            "A few years back, when i think this app was still very new. I could remember vividly how the app looks like before. It was 2014 maybe? I was just 13 and i almost had juvenile diabetes. I used this app and maybe a month??? I lost significant fat percentage. I am back to downloading this app again which is kind of a bummer. The app is very effective. I highly recommend it to everyone",
            "Great plans, but impossible to transfer data. Doesn't connect to Google Fit, doesn't support Google (or any other) backup... Smart Switch isn't supported either. I'm about to lose 230 days streak because I have new phone and it is very demotivating."

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

            "The tapping solution app is, hands down, the best thing on my phone. At any point throughout the day...no matter where i am...i can get relief from anxiety, instant motivation to move forward on a project, help with moving past any emotional baggage or blocks, or a peaceful way to move through any overwhelming emotion that might be triggered. Just knowing its there, always ready to use in an instant, is a comfort.",
            "Free items were great and they had decent amt. However I was unable to access the premium items during the free trial and also after I was charged the yearly fee. I contacted support but everything they asked me to do didnt work. Their support was readily available but at times their questions were redundant. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund. (app kept saying to pay then when I clicked the pay button it would pop up showing already paid) Luckily, I was able to get a refund!.",
            "Love this app but I had hoped that the downloaded sessions would play when the app goes down which it does from time to time. They used to but not anymore. And I have found lately they don't play even when the app is working so I have to go and find the session all over again. Downloaded sessions still not working. Wish they would fix this as the live session worked for 2 minutes then I changed session and can't get anything now.",
            "This is a great app and a great style of meditation. I really like how it focuses on affirming feelings, then releasing them. My one complaint is that you can't choose which voice to listen to. Each video is only recorded by one person, so trying multiple meditations in a row can be a little jarring. I tried the paid version hoping it would include that feature, but it did not. (I only do the meditations by Jessica and unfortunately most of the meditations are recorded by Nick. No offense to Nick, just my preference.) Other popular meditation apps have a voice setting to account for personal preferences. Would definitely use this app every day if they added that feature!",
            "I used The Tapping Solution for free to make sure I was committed to using it. After a week I decided to upgrade to premium. My body and mind feel like they are being slowly reprogrammed. For four years my right knee has been sore and painful. Walking up steps was a chore. I have begun to feel relief each day. I am thankful for this process and the Ortners. Don't be afraid to tap and begin to let go."

            "It's simple and cool. Autoprompting is my fav part Dev: Is there a way to customize the things that are surveyed? I'd like to use this to track my adhd symptoms throughout the day so being able to add my worst symptoms and then have like a high - low or 0 to 10, or having - not having, i could type it in myself depending on the symptom. Am I making any sense?",
            "Excellent app, very good range of options and very stable. UI is intuitive, and accessible. Colour coding also helps to avoid being overly clinical, and feels nice to personalise it. The one thing I really, really wish it had was a one time purchase option for the pro version . I would happily pay more than the going rate to avoid a subscription model.",
            "Finally, an app that lets you just track mood data on your phone without having to give anyone your email. Wonderful! This app is highly customizable, allowing you to track your mood, custom moods (for example, I added an uninspired vs creative slider), where you were, what you were doing, events that were happening. The dev is highly responsive- I emailed them about a bug and it was fixed in less than 24 hours. Couldn't ask for more!",
            "Pretty good, love all the options for moods to track and sleep tracking, however the schedule function doesnt work so well. Im supposed to get notifications for a survery once every four hours but sometimes Ill go a full day without any notifications, or Ill be asked to take four surveys in the span of one hour",
            "Very helpful to track and analyze mood and sleep patterns. Reminder alerts for surveys are so helpful! I'm still playing around with settings to customize, but decided paying for pro was definitely worth it. Thank you for adding the ability to back date a survey, 5 stars!"

            "I like the convenience of the app and makes counseling way more accessible than traditional counseling. I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",
            "I would rate it five stars if it wasn't for the audio on the app. The audio didn't work for me when I had to use my phone to have a session with my counselor. I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

            "This is the best workout app out there. I bought the full version after my first workout. It's that good! One of the best features is that it has lots of different workout programs from beginners to advanced which is really great so you can grow and develop using the same app. It also does different warmups and has a timer. Really it's feature packed. You can also make your own workout. I would love to see a feature so that you can create a workout on the desktop and then import it into the app or share it with other users. The other feature would be a rep range addition and some new workout programs added. These are just small suggestions and this app is in my opinion much better than Starting Strength or Strong Lifts 5x5, which I both own (and don't use since having this app). Other than that, this excellent app is only going to get better and well worth the purchase cost. Support the developer for making such a good workout app by buying it.",
            "Overall this app is incredible. Does exactly what I would want in a weightlifting app. Eventually bought the app due to how useful it is, glad to support it. Hopefully they keep adding different exercises, continue to optimize, add features, and fix minor bugs.",

            "Great app. Any plans to add Phase 4 for Starting Strength? Thanks",
            "An excellent workout tracker app! I really appreciate how the app is very functional without the premium features, but a one time fee for the pro version is definitely worth it. An interesting feature to think about it is the capability to create a workout program from your computer and import it into the app. There is an export and import feature, but the format of that file is not very readable/editable. That would allow people to not have to create a custom program on their phone. But overall, I've been using this app for a while now, and it is excellent for anyone into lifting and wanting to track their strength progress."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Needs fixing as it does not reflect the actual calories burnt in a day. 2. I would like to pick my own exercises in the workout generator",
            "It doesnt give tips on how to do it it just gives you an animation, But it was good and made me sweat a bit, totally recomend it for workout and self defense, or fighting.",
            "Overall this is a great app. However, whenever the app is counting down the seconds, it always pauses my audio that is either on YouTube and other sources, which is a little inconvenient as I like listening to podcasts while training. To the Developers, Are you able to fix this problem? Thank you in advance.",
            "Proper schedule of moves to be done in a day as per beginner, intermediate and advance level which makes it easier to do the stances and not learn everything in a day. Though as I have been trained in martial art previously I felt during kicks the blocks are not there which is disadvantage for a new learner as it will stay with him and he will face problem during fights.",

This app has definitely made me feel more confident. I'm not the best when It comes to physicality but this app has helped my feel I can defend myself without weeks of weightlifting and push ups."

It's so incredibly customizable they have literally thought of everything. From customizable caloric intake, to weight loss goals, to every exercise and interval amount you could use, visual gifs of the exercises in question, 30 day programs, choose any type of equipment you have and how long/often you want to work out and it will create your plan. 5***",
            "The app has a great concept. I like how it has specific workouts for specific muscle groups. But the problems I encountered right at my first use is it suddenly glitches and exits on its own, saying that app isn't working. It also doesn't have the switch side part when the workout you are about to do needs to be done on both sides of your body, like the side plank. It would also be better if there could be instructions on how to do the workouts properly. It's good, but still need improvements.",
            "Very great work out app you can make the workout harder if you like great work outs love you can choose your area o work out on. The best part os no one is asking for any money from me. A++ for me.",

            "Glad I purchased the Premium. Couple of feedbacks and preferences I've noticed since using this for a few weeks now. I wish there was a better way to construct different and multiple playlists. I have multiple playlists for very diff topics. Sometimes I wish I could play all of them while I sleep. Sometimes I wish I can play some. But it's designed to only play 1 playlist, and you can't modify it without changing the name of the affirmation altogether.",
            "I love the concept for the app, however, there are a handful of small usability issues that become really annoying the more you use the app. 1) No filter or search on affirmation record screen 2) No way to select multiple hashtag playlist for playback 3) No integrated way to stream own music while listening to affirmations. Dropping music vol in thinkup and opening other app causes affirmations to not be loud enough. Still like it a lot, though.",
            "*Edit: THIS APP DOESN'T WORK ON MORE THAN ONE DEVICE. There is no \"restore purchase\" option on my second phone when I download the app, because it DOES recognize that I've already got the premium plan. However, none of my recordings are there. I would have to re-record everything to use this on my other phone.This is a fatal flaw. Can you please fix this so the app can be used on multiple devices?",
            "I like that I can record my affirmations in my own voice. There are a lot of affirmations to choose from and I can edit them to make them personal to me. It would help if there were suggestions given on what background music to use to reach your desired goal. You can also change the level of your voice to the background on the paid version but no guidance is given. Also, the Android version is much cheaper than the one for my iPhone which I thought was weird.",
            "Unfortunately, the Android version isn't fully updated with all the features that the Apple version has. I hope you will update it asap. I bought the Premium version on Android and was dissapointed to see features missing: there is no option to control the speed of the loop of affirmations and there is no Stats tab with statistics about your progress. Such a shame!"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "Really like the idea and execution. My only negative observation is when you say I'm not feeling quite right and input none covid symptoms it then asks where you are. The 4 options given are too limited and do not include at work, other or give you the option of skipping. This forced me to enter false info. If there was a way to avoid doing this I could not easily see it (I went through twice to see).",
            "The concept and app are amazing and I try to make sure I complete the question every day, but there seems to be a bug (I'm not sure if it's specific to OnePlus - I have a 7t Pro and it's always been like this) where the last character or two in a line of text get cut off. Whether it's the case numbers, or even the name of the area I live in, it seems to happen.",
            "The app has stopped asking questions about how often I've been out for [this or that]. So I stopped keeping track. If that's a bug, FYI. If it's on purpose, nevermind. I long ago stopped reporting symptoms when I know thay don't mean covid. One I've had near daily for over a decade. Reporting it brings irrelevant covid-related questions. A cough at night goes away when I'm up for the day. Same problem. So I back out and say I'm fine. Too many \"symptoms\" suggest covid, regardless of reality.",
            "SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS: this is a great app and it feels so good to be helping! I suggest a revision that makes it easier and clearer how to report for multiple people. Right now you have to click \"done\" and then \"report today\" each time you want to report for an additional person. I suggest that for people who are reporting for self and others that after reporting for one person the app returns to the \"select profile you want to report for\" screen.",
            "I Like it, but as per other reviews, my Oneplus 6T is cutting off the data screens. \"42\" cases in my area reported on my phone, \"425\" on my wife's. - which btw is born out be the graphs. Also today - we're getting a 525 error both Android and Apple - is there something wrong with the backend? how do we report it? how do we find out? Difficult to find contact details. Nevertheless a useful tool and good information supplied in the blogs"

Either the snack section is for snacks and the drink section for drinks or add a drink tick chart in each section. With breakfast, lunch, dinner...",

No searching a database to find the right food.... just type it in and go. Its exactly what I needed to help me log and commit my meals for bright line eating on the go.",
            "Nice and simple... I usually make mine into bullets for easier review (simple enough to do oneself), but I'd love if there were a way to either review or download each day of logs. The app works perfectly for my purposes right now, but if working with a nutritionist or something, being able to send the info for a day, a week, etc would be a huge assist, even if it were just some kind of full-day review screen that I could screen shot. Otherwise, no complaints, aside from the annoying adds😉",

            "I really love playing this game, the gameplay experience is awesome. Beautiful graphics and smooth. I recommend this game for you, but if you can improve the movement of the characters: the way they dodge and throw a punch and allow us to make a combination like throwing two jabs and then uppercut. Please make it more realistic, I mean the movement. That's all. Thank you!",
            "Best game ever, really entertaining.... Just add more items to the customize hub maybe add more tattoos and more hairstyles and an option to type your name on gloves😁and make the characters movements more realistic like dodging and the way they throw a punch.. Thank you developers for this great game🤩🤩🤩",

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I'm on the fence - fun to play and level up. My big issues are 1: there is a limit to grind and grow and you can't win races due to the opponents being so highly ranked - spend a couple hundred usd and you will top out around 3000/4000. 2: racers are replays of other racers i believe your own mashed together so win and loss are completely stacked so even with a perfect race you will not win or you win for no reason. 3: teams can't control members. On the fence if its worth it to just play.",
            "The game is great, very user friendly the concept on bike purchasing is well done. The amount made per race makes it challenging to level up, as well as the amount of fuel given. One feature I would like to see would be a cart function between the team. Also. I hope an update comes soon for newer tracks to keep it challenging.",
            "DO NOT SPEND ANY REAL MONEY ON THIS GAME YOU WILL WISH YOU HADN'T.. SO much lagging it's not fun.. You lose race after race because of the lagging.. And they take points away for losing a race. I have deleted the game and reinstalled It is not my phone VERY FRUSTRATING WILL NOT PLAY AGAIN TILL THERE IS AN UPDATE.. If it's not fixed I will delete the game... Update: still no updates to fix lagging.. it's more frustrating than fun.. deleting game",
            "Unplayable pay to win game. You are able to win max 2 of 10 races, bacause of your cheap bike. But you can just pay or try playing for weeks until you unlock new bike. That means \"unlock POSSIBILITY TO BUY new bike\". For huge amount of coins. To earn that 25k coins you have to win 50 rides. Game allows up to 7 rides in a row, and then you have to wait or... pay. You have to collect smtg to unlock POSSIBILITY to buy mentor what will unlock tricks. But tricks gives no boost. Ofc if you didn't pay.",

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

I want to be able to log my water intake, as well as my calories, even if there are no carbs involved. Please fix this! It is an incredible app. I can print up reports for my primary care Dr, keep track of my activities, log meals, and so much more! Thank you!",

Also can add collaborators to read or add info to crate this awesome experience! Online baby photo book that backs up. Baby 101 info or searchable reading info that shows the source info so you can be assured that it's reliable stuff. Also baby quizzes so you can test your knowledge. Total 1 stop shop.",
            "We loved this app for our first child. However, our new baby is 3 weeks old and I have not been able to add my husband as a collaborator, so it's kind of useless until I can. The email that he receives appears to have a link that says \"Accept Invite\". However, it's not clickable. Is there another way for him to accept my invite to be added as a collaborator?",
            "I like the tracking options but I would not suggest this app to anyone. I am a nanny and have 2 babies to take care of. Half the time the app lags or doesn't save my information I put in. It is SOOOO frustrating and a waste of my time away from the babies to literally re-input 1/4 of what I already typed in. I've been using it for 10 months and I'm switching because it gets me so frustrated.",
            "this app initially worked well, but once we had over 1,000 photos for our first child and we added our second child we started having tons of issues. not worth the frustration. we are moving to a different app because of all the issues. I did like the little weekly and monthly informational bites."

I even cancelled my subscription but I think I am going to re-sub at the end of the month. The only thing I don't like is I find the analysis kind of complicated. I get a quicker picture of what's going on just looking at the calendar. Also what is the brown triangle in the right hand corner on some of my days in calendar?",
            "Excellent app. Would be even better if there was somewhere to enter symptoms; stomach cramps, etc. Edit: Maybe include Symptoms, in the menu where Bowel Movement, and Medication, is? Thank you!",
            "Easy to use and navigate. Been very handy keeping track of me. Just don't like you have to pay for full experiences",
            "This app has been so useful for me. I have IBS and struggle with bowel movements and this is ideal being able to track what they're like and how close/far apart they are. The one thing I would change would be where you log movements as \"urgent\" or not, if there was blood and if there was pain I'd add a chart. It would be useful to know by looking back if a movement has a little blood, or a lot. If it was a lot painful or just a lite.",
            "After my issues were addressed by the developers I'm glad to see improvement and interaction. However I still do not agree with the increase in price of the app since the application doesn't appear to use servers in order to function. It does work somewhat well,I just wish it had features for enema uses, adult diapers, and milliliters. But for the free version it does work."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

The initial video is completely misleading and flat out a LIE.",

This feels like just one innocuous, rambling man who just loves to hear himself talk. I see no directions on what to eat, alternating high carb low carb days for endomorphs etc. So far it is an utter disappointment that has me in tears. I got up early to start and was just bombarded with more long extraenous sales pitches. I will try again but if fat cold be burned by listening to him drone on and on, then I would weight 120 pounds.",

I purchased the $ 57 Fat loss that came with other packages for free (which otherwise would cost more than $200) You just have to be patient and watch all the information videos before proceeding to check out, otherwise you might miss a good discount. It's a good community and coaches. Yes it cost money, but it's really worth it. If you want free content for workouts or diets, go to YouTube! Be determined!"

            "This app is great and the support team is fast and friendly and I'm having a bit of trouble finding the right course for me but I just downloaded it recently and there are thousands of courses so I'm sure I'll find something. I kind of wish they had courses for specific mental illnesses like depression anxiety and eating disorders though but that's the only really thing I can think of at the moment that I'd change.",

            "Day 4 and loving this app!! I love that I can listen to my own music while using the workout. The workouts are spot on! I'm sure it's just because I just started, my only suggestion wouldukd be to show a quick animation between moves, or que as to what is next. Sometimes I am scrambling to quickly move into the next one. I imagine as I keep going I'll just know what each move is though. So awesome!!",
            "I love Jillian, she pushes you while motivating you. This app is great, it has a ton of variety and you can modify to whatever equipment you have and for your fitness level. With that being said, I only gave 3 stars because the app is glitchy. For something I have to pay for, I'm disappointed that so many things don't work well. I'm leaving this review today because I just finished a workout in which majority of the videos didn't work so I didn't exactly know what to do. Please fix this.",
            "There have been a few issues with the app, but the support always replies fast and is working on solving them and improving the performance. Thank you! Great app. So many programs to choose from, the exercises are so good and excellent advice about food and healthy diet with many recipes. I would highly recommend. This app is a life changer.",
            "I love the variety this app offers and I'm a fan of Jillian's style of workouts. I've knocked off a star for a few reasons, though. There are glitches, including one I encounter at least once a week in which I skip to the last cooldown exercise and it resets the whole workout like I never did it. That is very frustrating. Even more annoying is that now the volume of my music changes during the workout. I found this distracting and I could barely hear it most of the time, then it becomes loud.",
            "Love the app, have been using is for 4 mos now! I like the different exercise options and meal plans. It is nice that there are beginner option exercises, too. I love the new beginner yoga! There is also a calendar to track your progress. There have been a few random days where the app freezes and gets glitchy but overall I think its a good, useful app!"

            "A nice app with lots of options to customise workouts and reps. Really glad for the voice that announces what move is coming next as I always forget and the beeps for each rep. Has helped tremendously in setting up a simple stretching routine to help with my recovery from a back injury.",
            "I've been using this app for my back for years. I didn't realise I hadn't rated it!! Great app. It's really helped me with my back pain as I have a bad posture. In particular I always use the \"Stretching the spine\" exercises.",
            "At my age and 40 really only concentrated on upper body weight training in past. Thankyou so much for this app! Good option for a simple workout or with an added workout! Life saving stuff, encouraging and easy to follow and stay focused.",
            "I suffer from lower back pain ever since I got sciatica from a back injury. These small workouts actually work better than my rehabilitation workout. A minor delay between the rep countdown and the animation, but better to work at your own pace anyway and do how many you're comfortable doing.",
            "It is a great app to work on all parts of your body. The only disadvantage is that when you want to make your personal plane is gets difficult to order the exercises. I mean moving them up and down one by one is time consuming."

I just had a blood test recently that listed 17 foods that I am sensitive to, eggs, cheese, pineapple, rice as well as gluten just to name a few. I was sad that I couldn't add anything but gluten to my allergies list on this app. Thus making this app useless for me. 🙍😔",
            "this app has great potential but it needs work on its user interface, navigation and food variety. I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",
            "Lactose free food search, there is a quite a good spread of foods in the database. There are some foods not covered by this app",

            "This app is beyond amazing! Besides the well-structured workout plans, it gives non-premium users the opportunity to try out some premium features if they earn enough coins! The system is super cool and the developers deserve a props for it! Definitely recommend this app. It's the best workout app i've seen in a long time.",
            "One of the better workout apps I've tried, but for my program to gain weight, it doesnt give me a program option for upper body which I need for scoliosis; only glutes, abs and legs. I have to go manually pick my daily workouts instead of being able to pick a long program, which I would be more likely to stick to",
            "I'm a beginner with no prior experience on exercises. The videos are going so fast. This is the worst app for beginners. It goes super fast. There is no pause, no proper asn slower instructions. It is like going after a speedy machine. Beginners this gonna loose your confidence. Worst app for us",
            "Great app. Had an excellent mix of workouts (groups of exercises) and individual exercises. The workout plans (groups of workouts on a schedule) are well put together. The videos and exercise descriptions are informative and helpful. The only improvement I could suggest is to be able to build your own workout plan. Excellent overall!",
            "I'm really LOVE this Keep app which has a lot of exercise for users, whether you are teenager or adult, many choices have been provided for training. For a high school student like me, I'm usually forgot to have a training time before using it, but it will also remind me that my training time was times up, so I don't have to worried about."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "Good app, however a couple of things. It only allows or acknowledges 1 entry per day, I need to enter AM and PM and even midday if possible. The notes are not sorted descending from most recent down. The notes dont keep the syntax in the reports, no RTF? Maybe? Just one huge run on sentence...support the formatting as typed. And somehow now I'm getting google ads everywhere about anxiety, mental health, etc. I always use Tor searching anything related to that for my privacy. But google is evil.",
            "I wish you could post different notes on days and be able to see those represented in the graphs. Also I'm not sure if it's possible to sync data, but any time I've had to reset or upgrade my phone, I've lost all the data I'd previously logged which is annoying",
            "This is exactly what I have been needing. I have a tendency to forget when I have had good moments when I'm in a bad mood and vice versa. This has really helped to keep an eye on and better monitor my mental health. However the app is clearly a really rough one. It isn't pretty and that's okay but some of the functionality is frustrating. I wish the graph would let me toggle to something shorter than 30 days as the graph can be hard to read. Additionally, it doesn't start the graph where you started (day 1 is not the day you downloaded but seemingly 30 days before you downloaded). While you can submit multiple entries per day it is really difficult with the graph and really is difficult to see. If this was improved the app would be perfect for me.",
            "Love the concept, especially the personalization and the ability to track fluctuations over the course of a day, but it's way too buggy. The majority of the time, the graph doesn't work, which means I get no data output to look at. Also, I have not been able to get it to connect with Fitbit, so don't get this app if you want it for that feature. It just does nothing.",
            "been using this app for about a year now. in that time it's worked well aside from a crash that lost all my input up until that point which caused me to stop using it for a little while. definitely needs a backup solution, or at least one that is more obvious(?) The last update also made the graphing system unoperable for me. it shows at least one line for a moment before seeming to zoom way out on just the graph lines with no way to zoom back in."

Promising app, but VERY BUGGY. I've probably spent more time trying to get it to work than actually being able to use it.",
            "I'm on Samsung S 10 E. I have it a try for months but surrender. It keeps making me restart the app to record my completion. I like all the features if the app would work. Good video and timer. Now I just use it to go through the PT list but that's all. I hope things get better. I really respond to data. Tx.",
            "Potentially a very useful app but it needs a serious update. When I go to record my daily effort then often I have to tap at least twice on a number for the app to accept it. Also when I enter a partial effort then the app occasionally calculates an erroneous percentage. Also the goal targets can only be set by your physio, you cannot amend them yourself.",
            "Finally time set reminder are back! It so much easier like this. Nice and easy to use. I will reserve 1 star untill the bug were you click \"Next\" (as in complete) is not working correctly and you need to press it repeatedly or even after it work it didn't register so you need to go back.

            "This app is super great! I can easily look up food and check if they are low fodmap, in addition to what exactly it has (like oligos, fructose, etc). What could make this even better, is the possibility to look up items such as snacks that are low fodmap.",
            "Great App. Makes looking things up quick and easy. Gives safe serving sizes of items and what FODMAPs they contain. Hope to see many more items added in the future.",

Cons: If you close the app or move around in the app once your timer has started, it appears that the timer stops working. It would be useful for more detailed info on what to do (or not do) once a session has started. Would also like to be able to delete a session due to improper time recording. the app is decent - just needs some work.",
            "I like the app but it's a major battery hog. 30-40 min will kill 20% of battery. But the reports and blood level estimates are cool features. Would be nice if they had an easy way to add food sources via lookup.",

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "Absolutely love this app. Can customize workouts so it's great for everyone from beginner to advanced. You don't need a gym membership to stay in shape. All you need is this app and a chair. You will be amazed at how many awesome cardio and strength exercises you can do at home for free and without risking getting COVID at a gym. It's been a lifesaver for me.",
            "Personally I like the smart workout which I'm using to help recuperate after injury. I'd like the ability to browse through exercises after the session to rate them as the opportunity is lost if not paused. Also support for Google music is dated given the migration to YouTube. App urgently needs an update to reflect changes. Lost a star for that. An update could easily gain these back.",
            "It's a great app. I don't have to think about what I'm going to do for cardio. The workouts are balanced - a good mix of upper, lower, and core bodyweight exercises. It has a feature where it makes a workout for you (Smart workout), or you can follow the pre-planned workouts. This app is free, but I feel like it offers mostly the same content as many paid HIIT apps.",
            "Easy to follow exercises. Optional warm up and cool down. You can rate as you go along and your programme is modified accordingly. In our busy lives we sometimes tell ourselves that we don't have time to exercise. But 7 minutes?? We all have that. Perfect for me.",
            "I like the flexibility of time, location and workout objective with which I can use this app. It is also a customisable tool with diversity between strength and aerobic tasks. The blocks of time are also easy to fit within whatever I have available that day. I would (and already have to friends) highly recommend this app. Update 30 Sept 2020: Hello. Because of the workout library and the fact that the science behind the workouts is also available for reference, Iam upgrading to 5 stars. Kudos."

            "Ok, Hi! First off, This app is just fantastic! I can always watch out where the closest drug use has been taken! I love the chemistry part and the added information of the drug! I am actually really interested in drugs (Of course I won't take any) and how it affects you mentally. Even though I am only 13 years old, I learn alot already, how a type of drug can have an effect on me. Since now it might slowly be the stage where people always take drugs, I will always have a cautious eye!",
            "I honestly think this is a great app. I have no use for it myself atm. But life is life and people will be people. This info is often hard to scrap together. Can't vouch for accuracy bc it's too far away but if credible it could be a great resource for many many people and could help lessen stigmas by even existing. I am no advocate for or against the subject of this app. But it has the potential to save many many lives. Just hope that aspect was part of the motivation for creating this. Props.",
            "The app is great for learning about all types of drugs. I like how it also lists its soures, but the app can be improved on. For example, almost every single drug I see is MDMA. Mix it up! Not every drug is MDMA. Also, it would be cool if you could go to the Substances tab and click on a substance that has a drop down on all drugs affiliated. Like if I click on Nicotine, there would be a dropdown list of all drugs containing nicotine.",
            "This is an amazing app! Very user-friendly, with a lot of important resources. I especially love the database of chemicals. Much-recommended for anyone who uses psychoactive drugs.",
            "This app is AWESOME but something I would like is to explain the difference between ways of consuming, I know there is the graph but I think that difference could be more explained and that'd be cool and really useful"

            "Love this app! Just bought pro! There is a tiny problem though. Occasionally when a pop up that I can write in appears and I start writing in it, it disappears and I am unable to continue writing. One area where this is a problem is the routines section. When I go to add a custom item to a routine, the pop up that I would write it in vanishes as soon as I start writing in it. But other than that, I really really love this app. I anticipate it will help me discover patterns to happiness.",
            "When it asks your name it glitches and types incorrectly but after that it is a great app, it doesnt force you to watch ads unless you are comfortable doing so. Mood journaling has really helped me. I highly recommend it, better than the previous apps I have tried. Edit:The update works fully no problems at all. It would be nice to have different themes :)",
            "Really loving this app! I don't know if it's just me but there seems to be a bug whenever I try to add something to the gratitude journal section. Google keyboard flashes very quickly when I click on it but doesn't allow me to type anything. Otherwise the app. is fantastic! Edit: bumped my review to 5 stars. I was wondering if the latest Android update was the cause of the trouble. Glad to hear that that was the case and that it'll be remedied soon. Y'all are the best! 👏 Edit: Update fixed it!",
            "i love everything in this app. just a minor issue after the latest update, when i scroll down to see sleep tracking, gratitude journal etc., the scroll goes on forever, showing me sleep tracking over and over again. i can't reach to the end of the page. when i try to scroll fast, it glitches and turns back to the calendar. so i couldn't tap on the customise feed button. other than that, love the new features and the gradient mood colours are awesome. thank you.",
            "Such beautiful layout. I'm in love even before using it. I love the pleasant and calming interface. I will update my review once I have used it for a month. Have been looking and trying many apps to track my moods but didn't enjoy. This noon, just happen to stumble on this one and we just connected. :D Happy."

            "Man, this game is one of the better free games on the Google Play Store! I remember when I was younger I'd play this game and from then to now the game feels a lot more polished and in my opinion is better then most games you have to pay for on the app store. It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",
            "New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",
            "Oh no!!what happend!!! All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "Easy to use; accessible and very blind friendly; thank you. It's getting very hard to find an app that isn't overloaded with unlabeled images, buttons, and circular sliders. Thanks for a straight-from-the-hip, getter-done meditation app. You're welcome. I'm really grateful that the reminders are verbal as well. Most apps seem to think that visual reminders are enough, but blind people don't have the luxury of looking at their phones constantly, so thanks for talking to me.",
            "An excellent, totally free mindfulness app. Smiling Mind covers everything from children to teenagers to adult mindfulness foundations, with a variety of specific targeted mindfulness courses of all sorts to help with different areas like sleep, stress, relationships, work - etc. I've been using it for years and it's wonderfully ad free. As for mindfulness itself, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're curious, Smiling Mind is a perfect place to start.",
            "This app is so great when it works. It gets quite glitchy when it comes to member login and member data. It will not let me reset my password because apparently my email address is not present in the system but I am unable to register a new email address because I'm already registered in the system! When I was still able to login it would randomly delete my data and programs/progress. It will also sometimes just freeze in the middle of a meditation.",
            "I like the meditations however I dont like the layout and navigation of the app. A lot of the meditations are too similar, cant skip and have a long intro that I dont want to hear every time. The app logs me out often too and I have to login, which is an annoying inconvenience when I'm trying to relax to sleep. I fell asleep to it and it kept playing the whole night for 8 hours. And just then I was listening and it kept skipping to the beginning. It was rather creepy actually and now I'm on edge",
            "This app is amazing and has helped me to sleep again. I was relying on a number of medications to sleep but the guided mediations have drastically changed that for me. I cannot thank everyone involved in this enough, so I'm going to donate as well. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful tool freely available and without ads, it really has changed my life 😘"

            "This is a really nice app. I like that I can put my recipes in and it will calculate the calories of 1 serving based on the ingredients. I am following a paleo diet of 1,000 calories (I actually cheat a bit...a cookie here or there), so I am closer to 1,300, but I've lost 15 lbs. the first month. So far, so good. I just wish it would allow me to add ingredients in oz instead of grams.",
            "Only been using it for a couple of days but the variety that it generates is really nice! Not a huge fan trying to figure out how to get .66 TBSP's or .33 cups of milk for the recipes but the variety is definitely worth that hassle!",
            "It is so easy to use. The recipes are not complicated... And they are delicious. It takes away all the guess work. I finally feel like I found a program I can stick with. Loving it so far!",
            "It's very solidly good. I upgraded to the paid version and I am enjoying the ease of meal planning and monitoring my calories. There are a few areas that are a bit wonky, such as grocery lists that don't fully match meal planning, and not being able to copy and paste a meal from one day to the next. But overall I would recommend this app! One more plus is that if you have a question and you email the help desk they're very good about responding quickly.",
            "I love everything about this app! The grocery list, quick and easy recipes, it's been a lifesaver! I only wish there was a weekly meal prep option where we coukd make multiple servings of one item, because there are some nights where I don't really want to cook...sticking a casserole or something in the oven that I prepped earlier in the week would be ideal for those days."

            "Excellent app for new and experienced exercise enthusiasts. There are videos for each exercise, programmed workouts (and the ability to reprogram these workouts), and 'build your own' routines. Took off a star for repetitiveness with the programmed workouts. Each week ups reps but doesn't change the exercise which wasn't effective/necessarily exciting to me. Eventually uninstalled after finding a more dynamic app.",
            "Fantastic App. Easy to compile a set of exercises for any muscle group you choose. I use for my indoor training routine and works perfectly. Edit: Updated to paid app. Very disappointed in what it offers extra and the zero ongoing development.",
            "App is fine. Exercises are well recorded, but the week number does not change even after you have continued the module for the number of times mentioned.It always shows 1st week and 3 times.",
            "Original review (5 stars): Simple and effective. I like it. Edit (now 2 stars only): I bought the premium subscription. Paid the money but not a single one of the promised premium workouts appeared! I contacted the developers, but no reply. I re-installed the app and lost my progress/history (apparently the app saves your progress locally only, so if you reinstall the app or switch devices, then you lose your progress/history). It's a shame as these would be a great fitness app otherwise...",
            "My favorite thing about this app is that it lets you count reps instead of giving you a time limit. If I'm having a hard time with an exercise I prefer to take a little break and then finish the set, which timed apps don't really let you do. This app also displays the time if you want to use that. And it's easy to use and lets you start slow if you want. I paid for the unlimited version."

Best geared towards people with a little experience(you should consult a personal trainer if you don't have experience anyways). My only complaint would be that timed exercises like planks can't currently use the same in app timer that is utilized for rest between sets, or at least I haven't figured that one out yet.",
            "5 Stars to 1 Star. I purchased this subscription and have an issue with account recovery. I purchased a new phone and submitted a request to recover my account and there is a 72 hour wait time in which I'm on day 4 with no response. I requested a refund and google notified me that they are unable to provide one. I do not recommend this app for fitness goals or a subscription for the issue above. You lose your phone or get a new one they will not recover your account info.",
            "Overall I like the app and the ease of use. I wish it was easier to change dates for workouts. If you forget to \"finish workout\" it caries all those exercises over to the next day. Also if you are loading your own workout it would be helpful to be able to load them in advance as opposed to the day of the workout.",
            "Good for where it is thus far. Needs same features as iOS. Like that it builds routines for you and that you can add what equip you already have. Needs the ability to say what weights you have, but how many. would also like the ability for the program to show.me what weights I need to add to my bar so I don't have to think. Lastly, need to be able save workouts you've completed for future workouts.",
            "I really like actual 'guts' of the app. Nice selection of exercises. Good video and instructions. It increments the workouts as you go along. The muscle recovery is very handy. The GUI needs work. I would like to be able to see the muscle recovery percentages on the graphic showing the muscles. The android app needs as much love as the IOS. Please provide some integration with Google Fit or Samsung Health. It would also be nice to have a button to regenerate your next workout."

            "This could be a good app because it allows you to keep track of different parameters even in case you do not have Beurer devices capable of connecting to the app. Unfortunately my user experience is bad as I do not find it easy to use, mainly when entering data which is quite slow. You can not directly digit the numbers but you have to scroll until you get the right values, which case could take a lot of time. Update. After some days of use, my account was deleted and I could not recover it.",
            "What happened? This is junk. This morning it would not let me log in for a long time until I could recover my password and now this BF70 will not transcribe my data and all old data is lost. The app looks different and nothing is showing up on screen and the Bluetooth is barely working.",
            "Burdensome synchronization (I am on android). Constant profile hijacking by other family members. Conflicting settings app vs scales (eg. Imperial vs continental measures). I expected different experience. I am sufficiently disappointed to give up any further plans to buy other Beurer devices. I am really sorry. It all looked so promising.",
            "Good app, really nice to have sync between the scale and the app. However that seems to be happening in the apps main thread, which causes it to block until the sync is finished. While the sync is happening, I can't use anything and this is frustrating.",
            "As others have said. Garbage app. Connects 1st time then later on doesn't. Tried everything and just won't connect again via Bluetooth. Defo a problem with the connectivity. Poor very poor."

            "I have been using this app off & on since 2014. I've tried many different apps but I always come back to BodySpace in the end. It can be glitchy as all get out at times but I've learned to work around them. I've never had the major malfunctions, just annoying little stuff like search issues. I've never found any other app that have the flexibility to build your workouts so easily or swap something in your program if you don't have the proper equipment, etc. **Please update/add new workouts tho!",
            "Why hasn't the app been updated since 2019? With over 1m downloads you would think fans deserved better support after investing in the brand and the app. No responses to any comments left in all store either. (Appreciated that the development team responded to this message! Thanks guys. Look forward to updates and raising the rating again after)",
            "I'm not sure this app works anymore for Android. Have been using for the past 3 years and it crashed today. Doesn't load anything anymore, not even the 300+ workouts I've recorded. What a shame.",
            "I hate the record keeping system with super sets, it's a mess, jumps around constantly, love the body fit app dont understand why these two couldn't be integrated or at least allow me to create programs on the bodyfit app",
            "I've been using this app for years and it helped me a lot becoming serious about my goals. I still use it 6 days a week to log everything I work. I've used it on both iPhone as well as Android and both version have their plus and minuses. All in all, ios wins. I wish it was updated frequently so it could be improved but can't complain. This is the app that keeps me focused and I can finish my workouts without any distractions. Hope they can bring a team together to take it to next level. LOVE THIS APP. Will still give it 5 stars."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

No description on how to do the exercises, just the 3D animation. Keeps on suggesting pull ups exercises even though no equipment selected.",
            "I have not tried the workouts yet, but I wanted to let you know about one mistake under Nutrition Guide 101. Under Fat section there is a bullet point (a few) and in middle of them there is \"Fats to avoid\". I guess this should be a separate paragraph within the Fats. I am giving a 4 Star for now and update after first 7 days newbie Home workout.",

This app really encompasses everything i needed from fat burning, gaining muscle while considering most body types (not everyone is trying to lose weight). Great job 👍...oh am joining beta program",
            "Some programs are missing like the Athlos series in Spartan Physique programs. I cannot move to the succeeding workouts because of this. I'm still stuck at day 5. I hope they could fix this immediately."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

It is really helpful, but I wish it had less general explanations for some ingredients. I understand it is based off the listing from the manufacturer, but some of the ingredients are under an umbrella listing rather than specifically listed. Ex. Fragrance vs Essential Oils",
            "Don't bother with this if you live outside of the USA. I live in the UK & tried to use it repeatedly. It didn't recognise any of the products I tried to scan/ stated they weren't in the database (this included products from The Body Shop. Not exactly a niche, unheard of brand). When I tried to manually enter each product (a complete ball ache) the app repeatedly crashed. Talks a lot about the FDA/ how the EU regs are better, so I suspect it would work in the US.",
            "Good tool... Things to note though: To get all the perks, you'll need to buy the add-on (i didn't and still love it); Lots of products out there haven't been rated (but you can submit them); Some ingredient ratings are confusing (ex. natural fragrance has like 100 diff. names); Look out for reviews of products before buying (just because it's a '0' on the scale doesn't mean it's the best option out there😅).",

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Great app, just missing integration capability. It has great exercise routines for every part of your body, plus you can build your own routines. For the yearly membership, this is a great deal, the interphase is well design but it is missing a very important part for me, the ability to connect to other apps like Fit, Samsung Health and so on. If it had that option, this app would be wonderful. Hopefully that feature can be added before my membership ends of not I may have to go.",
            "I need the ability to set the timer for my sets not just rest intervals. That's because I need to limit the set duration. The problem is this: if I forget to click the \"did it\" button, then the whole workout falls apart as the rest interval doesn't start automatically after I finish the set. I have to be able to set time limits for actual sets not just rest intervals. This little thing makes this nice app completely useless for me.",
            "I have been really enjoying using the app so far! Though one thing would really push it over the top for me. I think it would be really nice to have the ability to let yourself know that next time you do an exercise, next week let's say, that you should increase the weight. Either with a little green up arrow that you could check that would show up next week, or being able to add notes to your exercise routine. I find I forget sokmetimes and there's no note function for each exercise.",
            "I paid for the full version to give it a long go. It's okay. But, its planned workouts are repetitive, 16 workouts exactly the same really makes gym time boring. Previous app (Fitnessbuilder) kept changing up exercises for variety in a plan. There's no easy easy to see what you did the last few exercises to see if you're making progress. There's no easy to take notes on an exercise ; sometimes you do poorly and want to add context, sometimes you're at a hotel gym and have to adjust weights.",
            "So far it's ok, I bought the premium for a year before even using the free trial. To start, you have to figure out your weights which I guess is understandable. If you try to do workouts other than the one they tailor for you, it gets kinda confusing. Alternates between 2 days but there's 6 blocks. No real guidance on the app. Also during my tailored workout today the app glitched 4 different times, forgetting where I was in the process and making me start over. Fairly frustrating."

            "This app is simple to use and to the point. The ads are also not invasive or distracting. Overall this app is A great way to keep track. However, it would be great if there was a feature to view a snapshot of what the user inputs for the week and/or month. How it is now, the user must click on each day to see what was previously input on the calendar And that is a bit annoying.",
            "I really like this app--it's easy to use, and I love many of thr features. The only thing I don't like (and I dislike enough to not give 5 stars) is that there is no category option for \"dessert,\" but there is a tag for \"junk.\" I want to be able to log my after-dinner chocolate with a label that describes what it is (not a \"snack\" or just \"food\"), but the lack of option other than \"junk\" feels annoyingly diet culture-y and shaming. That one flaw aside, this app is very good and suits my needs",
            "Great + easy to use. Would be nice to edit some of the categories mainly on the drink names as there is things I don't drink, such as energy drinks. Otherwise a good app, like that I can export the CSV to Google sheets and it's quick to add entries.",
            "Simple but effective. I was looking for something in which to record the meals that I was eating so that I could be more conscious about what I was eating. I wasn't interested in counting calories but I was interested in eating less. This works perfectly, though I do wish it populated a list of my prior meals in a drop-down rather than do the incremental search that it does.",
            "At the very beginning i thought what kind of journal doesnt keep track of days Pryor days was about to delete. I have since figured it out. Not only does it track food and water it as few other helpful things to track exercise, meds, supplements and a other other button. I will find this app to be very useful. I would have however been happy with a little tutorial."

            "So far it s a great game, i am now at stage 400+, but there is something i want to request... regarding the green chip and blue chip, my weapon are already legend and can only be step up using only yellow, pink and colorful chip to become mythic.. my green and blue chip are useless.. so can you please put an NPC that i can trade a certain amount of green to become blue chip then blue into yellow and so on, so that those chip still be useful. Hope you can grant my request, thanks much.",
            "Fun game IF REWARD VIDEO was AVAILABLE. I don't care if it isn't available give me the reward without the video... I have played many other games that don't run out of videos like this game. Awesome game, if everything worked like it does sometimes. I had tornado gun at lvl 250 an got the bounce gun, but it only went to lvl 220 an wants items to rank up, but every previous gun would level up to the same lvl of the gun I had. Guess it's a way to try an cheat money out of people...",
            "When I try to get triple reward, open chests or anything that requires opening an ad; it says REWARDED video is not ready. I also made a purchase but did not get the secondary weapon!!! Last but not least, you can turn off the music but why do you have to if there is no music at all 🤣 Even after the recent update, the problem still exists",
            "At stage 5 the shielded boss came and my shots are useless. No clue/tutorial to fight him. After 30min, out of frustration I charge myself toward him. Health gone but nothing happens. 10min later I was so frustrated and ready end it all, charged towards the boss, then surprise2, a robot came down. The robot damage the boss so slightly it takes 15 min to kill it. Clearly this game made by a brainless zombie"

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "Been a member on the plans for a long time. But the app is great when it works. However I am constantly having to log in and it doesn't stay logged in. Also the reminders rarely happen when they are scheduled. It is the latest and even when it says I should be getting reminders they don't actually come thru most of the time. But thanks for the input",
            "I love this app and use it all the time. Would love: 1) to be able to use it on my Chromebook. Having to choose between the tiny phone screen and our tv (which is in high demand) isn't ideal 2) to be able to save check-ins on the app itself. The sharing tool doesn't always work and then I have to either fast forward through the workout to get my picture back (which messes up my count for my badges) or I lose out on the check in.",
            "Love this app! So many workout styles, trainers, equipment, and durations! I'm a mom of two so it's great for quick, but effective workouts! Also love that it includes the nutrition plans! I can always easily find the recipe I'm looking for! I highly recommend for women looking to be challenged, uplifted, encouraged, and understood! 💗💕💗",
            "I remember when this app was busy and some features wouldn't work. But it looks like a lot work was put into it to improve it! Easily shareable, reminders to keep you accountable, and you can simply cast to your tv (If you have the corresponding device lol) It's awesome and motivating! I find myself always signing up for the new programs",
            "I was really disappointed that the programs are so cumbersome. You can't stream the workout on your computer which is how I normally follow workouts in that garage and I wasn't abe to cast them to my tv either. If you want to print material I would have to download on my phone email to myself to keep or print from my computer. I'm sorry I dont want to follow a workout on a phone"

        "description": "Binaural beats music is used by people all over the world as a form of ‘brainwave entrainment’ – a process used to entrain the brain into different states that contribute positively to well-being and personal-development.\r\n\r\nWhat most people don’t realize is that although the creation of binaural beats music has only been possible through technological advancement in the last 100 or so years, the use of this natural science dates back thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAncient cultures were aware of how the brain could be entrained through sound repetition well before modern science was able to prove the process. Of course, in centuries past, societies didn’t refer to this science as binaural beats, but what they did know was that consistent, rhythmic sound had extremely powerful healing and spiritual benefits.\r\n\r\nWe developed this Binaural Beats app in 2010 after we’ve learned about binaural beats and used them ourselves to solve sleeping issues due to the stress of our modern busy lives, something that most of us experience today unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThrough the years we’ve received amazing feedbacks from our users, which gives us the motivation and the energy to continue to improve the app. Check out all our reviews :-)\r\n\r\nWe’ve developed different types of presets : sleep, meditation, focus & attention, faster learning, pain reduction, creativity, anxiety reduction ….\r\nIt may take some time of practice to feel the effects of binaural beats so don’t give up after your first try.\r\n\r\nWe really recommend first time users to check out our Facebook (http://on.fb.me/lBDvPK) and Google+ (http://bit.ly/FBBTGP) communities.

The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone, for example, if 300 Hz was played in one ear and 310 in the other, then the Binaural beat would have a frequency of 10 Hz.\r\n\r\nYou can find a more complete description on the dedicated wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats).\r\n\r\nA few recent studies :\r\nBinaural beats and chronic pain : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Zampi%20DD%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=26773319\r\nBinaural beats and anxiety : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11191043\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* SOCIAL MEDIA *\r\nPlease join the facebook community at http://on.fb.me/lBDvPK\r\nForum on google plus: http://bit.ly/FBBTGP\r\nFollow us on Twitter #BinauralBeatApp\r\nOr read our blog (linked directly to the app) : https://binauralbeatstherapy.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n* PHONE REQUIREMENTS *\r\nNow automatically pause and resume if a phone call arrives.\r\nThis is why PHONE_STATE permissions are required.

The only app using bluetooth to listen through earbuds. Impossible to use for the intended purpose. Update: seems only to fail on the Study program. ADHD ran the entire preprogrammed time without stopping.",
            "I've had this app for a few years, and the Study & Learning track is very effective in helping me focus at work. HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. 😒",
            "For those of you dealing with the app getting killed in the background regardless of your battery optimization settings...try Mindroid. This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",
            "One of the best binaural beats app. It has pre set playlist and you can layer music over it so it's still.playing in the background.",

            "I must say that it's a great app and great initiative by the team , we live in a busy world n everyone is busy with themselves , but anxiety , crisis , depression are not rare , n even our dear ones sometimes do not constantly have the time to listen to our worries n be there for us , so this is where help like this is very important , i listened 4-5 audios n I m already feeling calm , n from now on I m gonna just put this on n drive away my anxiety n fears , I think it will be possible , thanku",
            "Amazing App to help you conquer anxiety! Barry has a soothing voice and his audios are outstanding! I am so happy that I stumbled on this app. The content is extensive and super helpful. The Deep Release under Anxiety Relief is my favorite to truly feel peace and calm. Try it out!! You won't regret it.",
            "I have extreme anxiety and panic attacks. This app has been amazing! Ive never felt so much peace and confidence in myself in handling anxiety as i do with this app. It has allowed me to accept my anxiety and beat it through meditation, acceptance, courses and building self confidence. It has allowed me to realize what ive been using as crutches and how to slowly wean myself off of them and realize i am my own safe place. The crutches hinder me and dont help me. And i feel much happier and free",
            "I like that I can listen to the stories on loop for free. I love the SOS section that can talk someone through a panic attack. For free!"

            "I think that this and other apps in the range really do provide an easy way to have a regular pre-determined work out set out for you to do. It removes the anxiety and stress of having to do it yourself. Videos and explanations of the exercises would be a great addition.",
            "love this app, really easy and straightforward, adjusts to your level and plenty of excercises",
            "Great exercises. I started using this suite of apps just a couple weeks ago, so I have yet to SEE results. I do, however, FEEL the results! I really appreciate the difficulty rating at the end of a session. Instead of guessing what level I should be attempting, I try a routine, rate it at the end, and enjoy a more tailored session next time. That is great! I would give it 5 stars, but the app does not connect to Fit regularly. Usually, only the first session in a day is recorded."

            "I find it over all a very enjoyable game and would put 5 stars if not for one really big issue. The ads many time over it has (without asking) download whatever its advertising. It will do it when I dont press anything or when I'm hitting the x button! I've had the weather app 6 times and solitaire 4 times and a few others. I've undownload them all but makes it very tempting to also undownload this game with it sometimes. But I dont want to. Its fun reaching level 365 and playing a great game.",
            "Updates are almost non existent...they haven't added new end game content in over 6 months. They also changed the boost system (watch an ad on demand for a 30m boost to gold and power) to a garbage rng p2w gear system. In doing so, they screwed over the player base that bought the ad-free pack, because the 30m boosts were the main use for the ad-free purchase. The graphics are great, but that's the only good thing I have to say overall.",
            "I was enjoying the game for the first 24hr but now it will not go past 91%. I have to Uninstall it and start over to get it working again. I did that 3 times now and sick of starting over. Please fix!!! I do believe it has something to do with the Google play games log in for that normally displays around 91%.",
            "2.3.3 nerfed high level medal farming into oblivion (96% nerf). 2.4.9 backed it off to a more reasonable 30% nerf. 2.5.2 added in a new raid and new raid gear, and if you get the new medal acquisition set you can now actually farm medals faster than before the first nerf. So if you were holding off on updating to farm medals, no need to do so anymore. Bug: My daily reset seems to randomly creep to later hours of the day when the app crashes sometimes, but that was a problem before the update.",
            "Well can't find a way to contact support so I'm doing it here. Game is fun I keep playing it constantly when I'm not playing my computer. Anyway there's an issue with Bomb Girl on the super legendary bomb to spawn a larger version of herself for more damage. She spawns and dies instantly. Very annoying to waste all those tokens on."

Sick of losing cause I can't control my own bike.",

            "Game works well but maaaaan the mechanics are nonsense. You can't really tell if your driver will lean back or forth and when most importantly and what is happening with lap 2. For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",

I would give it 5 stars but I think that they should add a track editor to where you could make your own tracks. If it were a option I would give this 10 out of 5 stars. I think turborilla should add in an easy track editor to make your own tracks. I've always wanted that in this game. I think it would also bring more players.",

But another benefit is that I just created a new routine very easily! Eg instead of tricep pushdowns (cable), I can just type in 'tricep' and it'll show me other options I can do at home!",
            "Seems like a great APP however, they don't seem to want my money. I m trying to pay for a subscription but I keep getting an error that my card is being declined. I am using multiple cards all which have enough money on them and none of them show any declined charges. I looked for a more discrete way to communicate with the makers of Strong - Workout Tracker Gym Log but, I can't find any contact information.",
            "Just started using this app but I guess I won't be continuing. Any fitness app is incomplete without it's version on smart watch or fitness tracker. Also, it doesn't support split screen, another useful feature when you want to use YouTube for your workout music.",
            "Love it... It keeps getting better. I used JEFit for many years; this is cheaper and offers more with a very easy to use format. Pictures, and Gifs. Really is all you need and totally worth the money. 👍",
            "The app helped me get started with weight lifting and helped me keep track of my work outs. When I had some minor issues, the help support was fantastic to answer quickly and on point. Can't go wrong with this app"

I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",

I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",

I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "I really like it. Its simple, but in a creative sort of way. Id definitly recomend it. Edit: so they did a big overhaul on the game recently where the game speed seems to have trippled. This does make the game better in my opinion, however the change has forced me to relearn how to play because my timeing has been thrown off. If you are new to the game, it wont be an issue. Its just a bit annoying. Still 5 stars because of how awesome the game is! Definitly consider getting it. Youll love it!",
            "An absolute legendary retro stylish action platformer!The multiplayer has crushed the goons having hard time with double players with hordes of skill!You can show you feelings to communicate with others, but a bug that's going around, if a player throws a goon to another player, the player gets damage the same goon does with higher amounts of upgrade, fixing it would help a lot, have a good day! :]",
            "My bf started me on this game and I have been hooked ever since! It's not necessary to have to spend money to go further or upgrade.also I love the little cartoon that sorta explains the game and what the objective is.i like the story that the game is based on alot it's very funny and kinda cute at the same time.cant wait to try multi player with my bf I know its gonna be alot of fun!I would recommend this game to anyone .I have told alot of people about it already and will continue to do so.",
            "Excellent game. The multiplayer update is very good. Five star for it. But I had a problem. That is in multiplayer friendly I can't create a code. It says network error. We (me and my cousin) checked our Internet connection and it was fine. It happened yesterday. Today its fine. BTW I love the update."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "With the recent update of the past month I just finally updated, the app is slightly annoying. Mainly do to I can't change music from notifications. I had to open the app to swap left/right and more than half of the time, I can't click the music next to a playing song. Again, I had to go inside the app and swap to it. Until this is fix, I'm giving it 3 stars. It's a good app, but the notifications bug is quite a pain to to.",
            "Ok so it is ok but the ads are getting worse, I would understand two ads (where one lasts 5 sec) but each lasting 30 seconds? Rlly? Before I could listen to the music offline and there were less ads but now it's just a total mess. To close those annoying ads I have to back out of the app completely. Edit: I already know that they get paid for ads, it's just that there's more than before. Also the ads are very long, especially for an app like this, where you listen to music...",
            "With the current laptop I'm using I've had to continuously check back onto youtube to unpause the music when i click onto something, just typing and sending would pause the video... This app is wonderful, i never had a disruption other than adds and their only 1-2 so its not that bothersome! Thank you! I can now listen to my music in peace <3",
            "Normally a great app for listening to music but in these last couple months, the app has been unusable. Major bugs keeping me from searching for an artist or entering a playlist. The app frezes and just acts like it doesn't know what it's suppose to do. I used to love soundcloud but I can't keep using it if continues to have these bugs even months after they started showing up.",
            "Sound cloud is great because not only can you enjoy a vast range of music variety, but you can also upload your own music on there as an artist. And also offers features such as repost which allows you to get your music heard by hundreds of thousands of listeners. This is probably one of the best platforms to build a fan base and sell your music. I would recommend this platform to any artist or anyone who loves music."

I've also attempted three times to update my profile pic for Halloween, and that's having issues. (Android user, yes I rebooted several times after yesterday's updates)",

I don't feel I have a use for your service anymore because of the recent unnecessary expansion of your business to implement a system of extrajudicial shaming/punishment, based solely on likely false or dubious accusations & without any semblance of due process, thru the awarding of special badges to businesses you feel are run or owned by those that you alone declare as undesirables. Try to not be too obvious with this badge however by making it a yellow star, pink triangle, etc.",

            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ❤️",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

Every type of situation and desire can be fulfilled by this app. You can relax, have deep sleep, memorize everything, study focused and deep meditation. Just wow what else can I say. Highlyyyyyyy recommended!! Must install.😇😇",
            "Would have given 5 stats, please make the background music OPTIONAL! Music can be very relaxing, but some would rather hear nothing just the frequency playing.",
            "I have used this ape for years and I love it. Its It's relaxing and never disappoints. It keeps me calm. Have tried others only to come back to this one. I like that I can set the time.",
            "I love this app but i have a few suggestions... first of all, it'd be nice if I'd choose background melody. For example, i need boost my brain in the morning but i don't like the Beta Wave melody... very much. plus, the quality of the pics isn't good which is a lil bit annoying too. but it'd be even better if there were a video or gif instead of photo. anyway, your beats don't hurt my poor ears just like other similar apps do. thank you",
            "It Actually Works.. no headaches or loud \"wahh\" sounds. The light music plays well with each beat. If you want a no nonsense, no (my head is going to explode\" and simply beats with music. Yes, You can create your own as well. Its nice and soothing as it should be! 😊"

            "Really great workouts for various skill levels, but the ad that plays automatically when pressing \"start\" not only was very sudden and without warning, it keep canceling the workout 6 out of 7 times instead of the workout starting after the ad. That is a pretty big bug when the workouts are the whole point and purpose of the app; if the workout would at least start right after the first ad plays, it'd get a higher score from me.",
            "When I started I had trouble working out and was very unfit. When I did do these workout I felt sick and was being sick regularly afterwords. When I got into it I started to do it without feeling sick and now I'm doing 1,2 or 3 7 min workout a day. This really helped me get back in shape. Would definetly recommend",
            "It's good... And the workouts need to shuffle automatically. Building your own workout often double selects items. Ideally after creation they can be edited. Text for naming workout is white against white background. Videos mixup on second round: 'running in place'.",

            "(1) Why do i need to allow access to my Google Play Games Account again & again ? I don't want to enable auto-sign in because i don't want to get registered to Games i am trying out everytime. None of the other games asks me to enable auto-sign in , neither those games have any problem like this. (2) Unable to Change Servers & Asia is missing (3) No Option to disable aim-assistant. Auto-Fire is Good but, enabling aim-assistant automatically with auto-fire is really a Bad idea.",
            "Best game. Sensivity of this game is best. Graphics are best. Easy to push our rank. And the best game under 50 mb. And their are more than 6 map in this game. The new update is awesome. And one request can you change the clan war settings.",
            "The new update looks shinny and new market place plus market place emulates steam workshop and feels similar to CSGO stuff. There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match. I always have to restart it to download.",

            "The micro transactions are nuts. We're talking some the worst around. $60 USD dollars for 760 gems. That is only enough for 1 gacha type system summon. I've played for a while so I know when I say. Play if you like baseball. It is simple and fun, the customization of players and building a team of created players is fun, but don't spend money.",
            "I played back during BS2 and remembered it being one of my favorite mobile games at the time. Saw people say it no longer worked which is natural for Gamevil. Then a saw there was a 2020 game. Gave it a shot and it's still pretty cool. Still in the newbie period so unsure if it'll last but for now it's a ton of fun.",
            "I always wonders what the F the devs thinking when they design the upgrade system and microtransactions, pricing it hundreds times more expensive than AAA games. Let's talk about upgrade system, you need exact same trainer card to upgrade said trainer, while it not a problem for crappy green trainer, good luck finding those SR or UR trainer. Unless you blow THOUSANDS of dollars, goodluck grind your asses progressing through this cashgrab. -4 stars for greedy ass devs and publisher.",
            "Love this game! Been playing for years on and off and this version is deep. Fast play through times to level up the players and cool stories that you can skip or fast forward after you've watched them for the 100th time. Great game, and it has a user manual to help you do whatever your thinking of finding.",
            "alright I been fan of baseball superstar since 2013. I spend 3 weeks on playing. it's a fun games but the microtransaction is so expensive than the 2013 . Another is one is the lack of pvp sure there is club if you join the club and superstar league but PvP is where real time players will face each other. But so far the game is good even tho it's pay to win you can improve your team and player without spending if you have patience and dedication."

            "it is a great game. you can decide how bad things can go or start of gental. plus I like the fact that if you have 2 certain symptoms it is a combo. I just wish there were more difficulties even though it is a free version I just wish there was more difficulties. besides that great game. also I like that the more deadly the virus the harder they work for a cure. it is like real life the more deadly the disease is the harder we work to cure it.",
            "The game is great, all of the different plagues are unique (Shadow Plague is my favorite), I do have two issues however. The better UI is locked behind a paywall just so you can have a bar showing the percentage of infection, and the UI constantly breaks anyway (usually in text boxes, with words being cut off or missing, the News tab also tends to just not show anything, making it difficult if you are loading a save and don't know what scientists benefit from).",
            "This game is exactly what it sounds like. A hyper-realistic simulation of spreading diseases that lead to the extinction of humans. As dark as that sounds, the game is engaging because of its realism and suspense. It makes you sit at the edge of your seat, since you don't know what exactly will happen. For these reasons, this game is timeless, as it teaches extremely important lessons about disease management, in a thrilling, intruiging, and thought-provoking manner. It's informative yet fun.",
            "It's such a cool game. You can give your desease different characteristics such as what climate it can survive in. You can choose to make it more harmful or less. You have to find a balance so that you don't make it too noticeable, yet contagious, not to deadly so it can spread, but can still wipe out humanity before a cure. You can also choose to start it most places in the world. What I don't like is that it makes Ireland apart of the UK. 🤦‍♂️",
            "This game is really fun if you just want to take your anger out on Humanity seeing the world-end within just a couple of years is kind of scary when you think about it besides that, this game is pretty fun oh yeah I thought I'd might mention that this game takes a lot of time and patience and I suggest reading over your symptoms of your virus. Oh yeah heads up you might want to get it on the computer it's better on PC"

Simple and easy and the visual and sound cues are crisp and make it easy to know exactly when to start and stop each inhale, exhale and pause. The only issue is the blue color which can interfere with sleep. A warmer color scheme would also be easier on the eyes at night.",
            "The app is Nice but no update in 5 years??!!!!! And why can't I download some breathing profiles/schemes? For example some pranayama or some holotropic breathing. Maybe some other sound available? What if I want to rename a breathing profile for save it when I change smartphone? Nothing! I mean it's still a valid app but no one behind it. No updates no improvements. I'll change my review as soon as the developer want to show up./ I purchased the app like 4 years ago, I paid for pro version and I didn't see any improvement. Unfortunately.",
            "Great app. One of the best I've tried. I rely on the vibrate feature. (The voices and sounds are otherwise very distracting). The vibrate is not working on my pixel 2 xl anymore. Not sure if it was an update from you or something else but without the vibrate feature working I can't really use it anymore."

One thing is that chests have an unplentif amount coins so maybe put a bit more coins in chests. Anyway good game, A plus graphics, a new Bat? I could never think of that!",
            "It's an fun and very addicting game, but I get matched with players 10 × my level. I'm on level 1 right now since I've just been introduced to it. I can't play the game due to the fact that I am dead in a matter of 15 - 20 seconds. My teammates will not give me a chance to grab the weapons either. Also, the items are a bit overpriced. I will redownload this game once these issues are resolved.",

I contact help disk and he bretend that my subscription is over, while i just took one day for 7 days !! It's a joke. There are alot of hackers whom I can't report!!! Believe or not, you cannot report them. He can kill as much he can, and no one can stop him. Please Don't waste your time and money, until they fix there issues!",
            "Game is very addicting but clearly pay-to-win, you cant play without it. My problem was that after I made a purchase, the game stopped loading. \"Something went wrong\" everytime I logged in. I tried to get a refund but no response. Very unhappy, I had high hopes seeing the advertisements but it's a RIP off!",
            "Great game I have about 9 character and they are just great this game is my most greatest game that I have. Just asome. Update, it's been about 2 years since I gotten a new character. It starts to get boring and I haven't played some time. Every timei get a golden crate, I always expect nothing out of it. Dont get your Hope's up. Look at me I got bored of a game that I loved for soooooo long and. It's starting to make me feel like why did I get this game. The point is the character percentage."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "Great App it works in the background and this appears to be done randomly. I say that because every so often I will get a report on my phone stating the number of Apps which are safe. Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

You should build something into the trim feature that fades the music in or out 16 counts so that it doesn't abruptly start or stop when using trim. This makes it sound horrible during class.

            "I've played this game before, and I love it. But now that I've reinstalled it, it isn't loading. Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "Why nerf the T-Rex in the Oct. 7 2020 update? Reducing the stars. My fully upgraded T-Rex went from too overpowered in the previous update to now underpowered in this update. It cannot jump 20+ meters high and do 5 to 6 airwalks in one jump anymore. I'll give more stars if you fix it. I want the T-Rex power back, not the fake T-Rex suit.",

            "I had the old app when I was on maternity leave with my first child and it was great. Unfortunately the new app is really clunky,, it freezes constantly, takes ages to update any changes to the weekly menu and has the wrong amount of ingredients for serving size. It will say 1 serve but then the amount of ingredients will be for 4 serves. I have to up the amount of serves then decrease it again to get the right info. It's just a really buggy app but has the potential to be great.",
            "Needs a bit more work. freezes, records workouts then they disappear from your daily records other times after the work out it doesn't come up to record your workout. A little frustrating at times to keep an accurate record. Recording food is a little behind, would be nice if it remembers your food from previous to record quicker and don't have to type each day",
            "Was a great app, just a few issues now, have to log in everytime I go on it, now everytime I do log in it won't let me log any water or food until I have clicked on the diamond rewards blinking thing, i have read it all once, I shouldn't have to go into it every time before logging anything, also my fitbit keeps un-sincing from the app now..",
            "Well I have only being using this healthy mummy app for about 3 days and I am loving it so is my partner we didn't really no something could be so easy and simple to use and follow the healthy mummy recipes and all the information you get on the side is amazing there's been a lot of work put into this and you can see it I would give it a rating at 100 stars if there was any and this app just makes it so much more easier because you can save your favorite recipes to. Thanks healthy mummy.",
            "It is awesome for the recipe ideas which is mainly what I got it for, but it logs me out often and my previous tracking and \"diamond awards\" resets back to zero and it can't be a bit discouraging seeing everything reset. If you want this for Recipe ideas I recommend getting it but definitely has some bugs to work out"

Just one minus, doesn't sync with external devices i.e. my Samsung watch, Google fit only hence 4 stars. PS. I recommended it to my wife, and she started using too.",
            "Honestly, this has been my favourite workout app. In other apps I followed the 30 minutes routine and I didn't even sweat, but in the 7 minutes workouts of this app I truly feel like my body is working.",
            "I've been using Seven for a few days now and I'm really enjoying the experience. I had been doing 20-30 min exercises every day in another app and rarely breaking a sweat, so I was pleasantly surprised to be sweating with just 7min using this app. The workout animations are very helpful and the vocal coaches are fun and motivating. The only issue I have so far is I wish it would give you a minute rest between 7min cycles so you can catch your breath and a drink.",

            "10/9 update: app no longer opens. Uninstalled, reinstalled, every time I try to open, an error pops up \"how we feel keeps stopping\" I had started getting warning that it was causing high battery consumption so maybe for the best. Entered it faithfully for 6+ months but can't enter data when it won't open. We had a good run. galaxy S8",
            "The \"update\" has failed miserably! I can't even open the App, it either flashes a blue screen OR an error message. I've sent feedback @ least 3x, with no reply back. I've uninstalled & reinstalled, & I've shut my phone off & on, nothing helps! Something similar happened in Sept too, although when I reinstalled the App after over 100 check in's it started back over at 1 as if I was new to the site. Hopefully you'll get this taken care of ASAP or like everyone else, I'm going to have 2 uninstall.",
            "Well, it's about 7 months, and over 180 posts after my first review. The app won't open for me, it just bounces right back to the home screen. I'm sad about this, but it's been happening for a couple of weeks now. The developers should update, or fix whatever is going wrong.",
            "App WAS a good tool, but after almost 190 days, it no longer opens and keeps throwing error messages throughout the day. I've appreciated the tracking for the past several months, but it looks like it's time to uninstall.",
            "Since the latest update, this app does not start at all,l in my Galaxy S20 Ultra... crashes immediately. Dev should ( in my opin) roll back update until a stable Android update is available if they want to keep collecting free data."

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

Do not play this game. You will be disappointed majorly!!!!!! I think they make you lose the majority of the games so you will spend money on this app. Very disappointing!!!!",

            "In general, a really good app with lots of functionality. It would be nice if the font stood out more. I feel like I'm always squinting at the screen. Also, entering numbers with scroll selectors is like threading a needle every time. WW has a option to tap on the number and type the data. If you could add this I'd be so appreciative! It would also be nice to be able to 'like' replies in Community and to reply to people by name.",
            "I've been having trouble with the app with the new upgrade. When I try to enter info on a new food or add a recipe, I get a blank screen. This is a pain and hope it fixed soon. I reported it on 10/23, but haven't heard anything back. I tried to take a picture of the screen to show you, but it won't allow me",
            "You have to pay for Pro to get access to key functionality like recipe builder. Pro is heavily advertised but it isn't made clear only US brands & restaurants are supported so UK members get no benefit from this being unlocked. Being able to post in the community is also unlocked but there is no tagging functionality so it's almost impossible to have a conversation with someone. You also can't search for other members. In databse pre populated veg is by cups not by item unless added manually .",
            "I love this program however, the update 2 days ago messed up typing on the community boards. You can't see what u type. Others are having the same issue too. Help!!!",
            "The text is much too light to read! Too many steps to find a food. Should be more like the app lose it. But please, make the text darker."

            "Overall it's fun. It's hard to advance quickly without paying. Joining a strong alliance is important, otherwise you become a farm for everyone, making it even harder to level up. The game can require a lot of your time, which makes it difficult to join a super active alliance if you want to have a real life. It would be nice to have a doomsday option available in lieu of eden.",
            "Though most games design their algorithms to promote purchases to progress in the game but Last Shelter provides misleading information on their packages to sell which is highly unethical and malicious in nature. I tried to report the same few times but there is no support from the developers. You cannot even view your last purchases packages nor the complaints raised against them. There is literally no log or history of anything which is very weird. Finally, I have reported the same to Google and looking for a resolution. I strongly believe that the developers must follow some basic morals and not dupe its users openly. I still play this game as I have made a lot of friends here. Also, I believe that only if we persist against there kind of malpractices then only we can make the gaming industry reliable and fun. Thus would continue playing this game for my friends and continue fighting the battle. Cheers!",
            "Updated review..... Some of the gameplay has changed for the better. However this is still a multi million pound Chinese based money maker and pay to win is still a key component. The tasks and battles are all Beijing times, daily reset is 3am in UK so I lose out on lots of stuff. My advise is to not take it too seriously and don't spend money until you know you like it, as there is no such thing as fair in this game, it's a full on war game, but very addictive, fun and annoying. 2 year player.",
            "Avoid it. This a MMORPG game AND a 200% pay 2 win. Don't think going far without any penny. Of course, you'll always find ONE player who reached lvl 25 for free... He needed 8 months at least, 8 farms and... 6 hours/d without any day off. Welcome to your NEW no-life, at the expense of other games ! You'll see it when you reach lvl 25 and T10 (best permanent army so far), because if you play casual like me, (2 y), you'll still be upgrading and must shield your base each weekend (or run fast).",
            "Fun game so far. You need patience and persistence to build a solid base. Spending money is bonus but not mandatory in early levels. I've been playing less then a month. Update: Now after several months of playing, you definitely need to invest either in game packages or more time building farms or both to grow and be competitive. Hard to grow beyond base 18-19 otherwise."

I first thought that it can be due to my device's ram, which is 2GB but later I found out a friends device which has this same game and ram as 6GB, while he is also facing the same issue. Please fix this.....",
            "I like the game, it has good graphics.but the things u should work on is the controls, because it is weak,when hitting your opponent the wrestler already smack u down.and another thing is there should be a commentator, during the fight.it's a good game in gameplay, but need to be upgraded.and the wrestler's are not real, no real names,no undertaker,or Justina..so poor.☹️☹️",
            "This game is rigged, everything is working against you. I'm giving it a second star because I'm actually enjoying the game. The stats of the characters are actually useless, because someone you're more than by far can just do as he pleases with you and your moves. It would have been a very wonderful game if you didn't make it very unfair to the players. How can a ref count slowly for you and count fast for your opponent in a game? It's a rigged game, not challenging at all, just rigged.",
            "The best wrestling game on the market, and as a fellow game developer extremely well done for what it is, the actual controls have a bit of a learning curve but its amazing once you get them down. I had to buy the full game. Super excited for the new one boss. :) if you need a tester i would be honored.",
            "It was a nice and wonderful game, good graphics, almost real characters and credible moves but I rate this 4 stars because I think it wasn't totally perfect. May I suggest that you can set those attack here as a finisher or mid-air counter like superkick or bicycle kick. I think there's also a mistake in this game. How a gaunt wrestlers lift up a chubby and 7 ft tall opponent? Then if your opponent kick up to your pin, you can't get up emmidiately instead your opponent get up first than you."

But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

Developers, what's going on with you? Thanks and goodbye, this app is trash... This wasn't happening a few weeks back.",

And the \"home\" screen has a huge banner that's hard to remove, it says \"more statuses\" and has a lot of languages. I guess they want me to download statuses from people I don't know. I hate this app now. Why did I have to pay if you still show me banners? I don't want to see \"more statuses\". All I want to see are my contact's statuses",

Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",

Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "Game double jumping: so cool to double jumping Red Ball. it is to double jump in order to double jump we all have to press the up button 2 time's. in laptop or mobile phone. if you play in laptop you can glitch the game. Glitch the game: play in laptop go to watch a video of how to glitch the game of red ball 1234 then bingo done.",
            "Its amazing, it had good gameplay, good looks and its very challenging, fun game, it gets a 5/5 tho i got an idea, in the underground/cave levels there should be shards with random colors, when your underneath them they shake for 1 second then fall, there will be 3 colors, green with a speed od 0.3 pink with a speed of 0.9 and yellow with a speed of 3, and can you add a level maker? That would be so cool!",
            "After having the free version of this game for quite a while, my son asked me to put down the massive $1.99 for the Android TV version of this game so he didn't have to wait to unlock lives. On the NVidia Shield w/ controller, this game is a blast for him. The paid version unlocked tons of fun worlds and levels. It's fun simple game play that reminded me a bit of Mario Brothers to be honest. Simple game play but still fun enough for both of us to enjoy. GREAT for kids!",
            "It is crazy how bad the controls are. I have lost all of my lives (all 5) on one part of one level in the first set of 15 because the controls won't respond to me and I am constantly falling off because I have too much speed for the controls to be able to stop after they finally wake up and realize that there is an input. The controls feel harder to use than how hard it is to herd cats.",
            "Very good game and it is also good for children and elders.......my daughter loves this game and when she feel tired or when she is bored she plays the game and she is very happy....one thing she doesn't like and that is the life issue because there are only five life's so when the hard level come and there were no life's she feel very sad.....now she is in 54 level ( fourth episode ) and her age is 11.......so i request to fix these issue and also if total 5 life's then reduce the timing....."

Workout demo for each exercise, Voice guide for timing & reps required for each exercise and rest, Multiple difficulty levels and other plans available in addition to custom plans.

I like how you make it easy to being imagined. ☆ Inside this app, there's so much life lessons they've (OC's) taught me that my parents or my teacher don't. Thank you for making such a beautiful art. ♡ I still.. collect some money to buy the premium one (haha). I hope it could be great seeing your premium art displayed on my android screen, soon. Stay safe and sound! ✿",
            "I found it boring to be honest. I can see some people may like it. It's a choose your own adventure story. It's written well but often offers choices with only the Illusion of choice. All answers seem to lead to the same thing. In the story some questions the characters ask you it really feels like it's gathering information about you to sell off to advertisers. It asks what your hobbies are etc. I am unsure if this is somehow related to the story later on or not I didn't get very far into it.",

Rather infuriating after all the reading to that point. If I had known, I wouldn't have bothered downloading and reading the whole thing to get nowhere.",

            "So flipping good this app! It's like having a counselor in your pocket and it sends \"nudges\" or notifications to your partner when you complete a section so that they can engage too. Marriage counseling at a fraction of the cost! Waited 10 years to finally download an app that would've helped those 10 years go way smoother! I feel silly for not looking for something so easily accessible before! Highly recomend!",
            "This app forces you and your partner to answer some pretty tough questions, but the devs have laid out an excellent format for couples where these sessions can be done solo (without fear it judgement) and answer comparisons that can easily melt the icy heart. All the while, being offered guidance and knowledgeable insight every step of the way. Great job Lasting Team. Thank you for such a great app",
            "Loving this app so far. It has created MUCH needed communication and understanding of each of our current needs for us to work on individually as well as together. It is helping us grow in the right direction. I love all the reminders too throughout the day.",
            "Today is the 7th day of my 7 day free trial, I did not decide to subscribe and wasn't asked if I wanted to pay for more than the free 7 day trial, but my bank account was charged anyways. I haven't even opened the app in a couple days. I would like my money returned now that my bank is in the negative and I was not notified before it was charged.",
            "Lasting is a fantastic tool to improve anyones relationship health if you follow and use the tools given. Excellent at revealing the inner thoughts of each person! It even helps you to say what you want to say to your partner, for those having trouble finding the right words."

            "I remember discovering the \"Draw a Stickman\" Series because of one of the Samsung Stores' phones having \"Draw a stickman: EPIC\" and i would go to that place just to play it. Now that i own a tablet, i would play these games instead of going to a Samsung store. It's like the previous games. Though i have problems with this game. Such as the voice acting (the player getting hurt), the lag, and the drawing system. So please fix it and i will rate better.",
            "Well, first of all, (for me) this is the best app ever!! BUT, actually, to be honest, I really haven't played the game. Why? I'm really not sure, but, I think it's the gadget I'm using. You see, everytime I open the game, it shows what I think its supposed to show. Then, after I was told to draw my hero, the game loads something. That's where everytime I get kicked out of the game. I really think this game isn't compatible with my gadget. I hope Hitcents get and fix this problem A.S.A.P. >=<",
            "Overall it's realy fun but whene ever I get hurt I sound like a girl we should get a voice maker because all stickman are not girls in fact ther not all humanoid also I like the old graphics and the very first ones too these ones are good but it would be nice to select type of graphics (it could be called Witch coler pence type do you use in the menu settings) UT I love the bosses and puzzles!",
            "Love the game as a whole. BUT WHERE IS THE ERASE TOOL!?! When I am drawing something, and if I mess up but only realise it after I am almost done, I don't want to get rid of everything after that so I can get rid of it, I WANT TO JUST ERASE IT WITHOUT HAVING TO START IT OVER! Everything is fine, except this one, VERY, important thing!",
            "I Love this game but I do have some complaints about it first off, where is the pink pencil? Or the bubble pencil I have completed all the levels and there is no pink pencil I can see it at the town area but I can't get it! Second problem on the first chapter it is almost impossible to get 3 starts! Are you kidding me I have searched all over and still no sight.. And for my last problem I HAVE COLLECTED ALL 10 PAGES AND I CANT GET THE SPECIAL BUNDLE. I hope you can fix some of these problems."

I tested it out on some products in my house, and what really impressed me is how lightning FAST it is when scanning and looking up products. Unfortunately there were some products that it didn't have in its database, but this app will certainly come in handy anyway. I hope the database is expanded in the future!",
            "Exactly what I need! I started scanning everything in my fridge and cabinets. The scanner is super fast and accurate. The few things that didn't show up, but most did. I am new to gluten free and this is perfect for me.",
            "I'm glad I only installed the free version. I'm new to avoiding gluten and very few of my foods I have in my house even show up. The suggested or related foods are always some expensive wholefoods brands.

Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials.

Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry.

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "This is a wonderful app! The exercises are intensive but you will definitely see results if you follow the plans. One thing that I love about this app is the fact that it can make a plan specific to you based on your fitness goals or you can use the plans already on the app. Also if you just want to work a specific body part; it show exercises for that as well. Most importantly, you don't (necessarily) have to buy any equipment to use and or accel.",
            "Im coming from being a 2 year subscriber with Freeletics. I loved Freeletics, the coach was fairly intuitive and I did see great result but each workout became too repetitive and I think I hit a wall as far as being motivated. Plus it was a pretty penny. I've only used Spartan for 2 days but so far I like how they incorporate the dumbbells and jump rope. I wish there weren't so many breaks in between sets but I usually skip them to complete a circuit. Excited to see how my body transforms!"

            "This game is awesome my favorite game on this is zombie mode that is super cool and just game I don't know what to say I like the first and the other one they're good but this game is very amazing I hope you have some more updates like you game modes and I hope you have a good Halloween🎃",
            "Hi NESM.This game is good it is good, but the things are hard to get like hulk and some other weapons I rate it 5 but please be sure to fix this problem for the people who have money it's easy but people who dont it's hard. Plz make hulk cheaper. Thank u.",
            "The game is epic, I'm not gonna lie. The first thing that irritates me is, I cannot see the gauge of other sticks. I just keep on fighting them until I can't fight no more. The second thing is, we can't take other sticks' weapons after they have died. If they die, they must leave the weapons behind so that I can take them and finish the rest of the sticks off. Those are the only things that I wanna see in the game. Maybe you'll add them in Anger Of Stick 6: The End Of The World 😃😃",
            "Very good and additive game but only one problem; can you change the archer control function? It is a bit difficult to aim and yes one thing! I think you should add horse riders BTW very well done ✅ keep updating 🤠 Thank you 😊"

            "Fun game. I mean, it is a stick figure shooting game, fend off the coming waves and move to next level. Unlimited lives so if you have food (you need food to play), you can play. As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",
            "Looks amazing at the beginning.. but as you advance the game looks more bias towards us... Very Poor. As I advanced further in the levels.. I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",
            "Here's the problem. 1)The loading between campain or character choice are far take Long to load. 2)Sometimes the arrow weapon or thrower weapon didn't hit the target even if it touch it,it just pass pass through the enemy. 3)After we die we can't use gems to revive ourself instead it came after 4 or 5 time we die in the campain or endless mode.4).Sometimes when we craft some javelin the damage decrease how? It cost 4000 to craft and the lvl and damage decrease.THE GAME IS FUN AND SPENT OUR DAY",
            "Pretty fun. One of the better phone games I've played. Not perfect from a fair, competitive standpoint, but that's not what they're trying to be. Kinda stupid for them to limit how much you can play the game with the \"supplies\" system, but whatever; it's their business."

I have to check the calendar at best to find tasks, at worst I have to refer to the email I was sent. Making the app effectively useless. I can just use a calendar app. That way I can see the info i need at a glance without having to dig for it. UPDATE. I don't see ANY of my projects at all in the app. Just deleted the app. Thanks!!",

There is no option to enter in your password and email combination. Since my email accounts are both Gmail I'd be obliged to logout and login back in each time or create a new account and lose my work. Is it really asking too ...",

Doing it the other way around works??? Also Why confirm my appointment by SMS, and tell me to use the app in that SMS if the app can't confirm appointments?",
            "Fantastic GP, however because he likes to take his time with patients is always behind schedule. But we do wait because he has been great for us. Really like this app because it's quick and easy to make appointments and whilst having 4 children is sometimes hard to make phone calls.",
            "Very helpful and gets chance to know understand Hospitals and Doctors... For some doctors full details are not updated. That will helpful if u ensure updated.",
            "Great for making appointments, would good if had more options, ie viewing results; requesting scripts. I used one in NZ that could do all that",
            "Easy to book appointments, particularly with my gp as they have a whole booking system based online. Every time I go in to book I'm logged out of the app, though. Maybe it's because I only use it every few months or more, but it's a bit of a pain having to login every time I'm sick which doesn't happen all that often. Not a big issue, and probably a security thing but would be nice to stay signed"

            "It's a great app. But it has a serious problem that some of their screen types do not rotate on Arduino devices, including on Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e and S6 that I'm using, or on the A71 and S20. It's extremely important that all Monday screen types do rotate landscape & portrate properly to make it usable. Yes I have already sent you screen shots. In apps such as Calendar, Zoom, Office, WhatsApp, Gmail etc etc all screens rotate properly, but not in Monday. Hope you'll fix it soon.",
            "Update: Previous issues have been resolved, thanks! I'm having a few other problems though - when adding new items to the board I can't subscribe other members to this item (I can do this on my computer so I have the permissions), also tags not activating on updates, and I can't find the option to edit updates. Thank you!",
            "Just when I was setting up the boards and telling my team to download this amazing app. Barely 30 mins in, it decides to delete my board and stop working. All my work down the drain.",
            "By far the best project/team management app I've used. The way it integrates the columns together and the ability to switch between different views are excellent features I have yet to see on any other platform.",
            "The inability to customise the date format is very frustrating and leads to confusion as the ROTW uses dd/mm/yyyy but the app is locked into American style. Please add this feature, it's available on the desktop."

Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "Awesome concept. Recommend to all my friends. Feedback: (1)Be able to edit/remove power-ups. For example: \"playing with my cat that is no longer alive for 10mins\" is triggering to see. (2)Allow multiple resilience slots for quests and power-ups. Example: \"having a hard conversation\" is both good for emotional & mental. (3)More variety of completion music. The fanfare is annoying. (4)More artwork & personalized avatars. It helps our imagination and reward centre when we see our imaginary selves.",
            "Cute, and great for people who want to improve something but may struggle with motivation. Everything is pretty well detailed and explained, and even the science behind it, but in a way that's not overwhelming at all. Honestly I'm amazed.",
            "This app is everything. I first found it a few years bc of Mcgonigal's TED talk and now, after finishing up my psychology degree, it's the first thing I reach for to get me through, well, everything. Brilliant design to gamify your life/sanity.",
            "The gamification works really well as a concept but the execution really needs work. Obvious bugs like not calculating user's resilience points correctly really destroys user experience. Hope you guys will fix the app soon.",
            "Pushing people to register and without Google plug, will give you pretty good bounce rate..why I suppose register if I don't know if I will like it. People only register if they have clear need, or they know the app already so they are inspired to do it."

            "Honestly one of the best fps games in the play store that I've played. Love the weapons, the graphics, and the overall feel of the game. The ability to backup/restore really comes in handy for moving to new devices, or even if you just want to delete the app for a while when you're low on storage. Wish there was an online multiplayer, however the lack of that is not enough to rate this any lower than 5 stars. Great game overall.",
            "It's a good game but it's missing some important things like customizable control and auto shoot if possible but most importantly customizable controls, it is really hard to aim and shoot at the same time with thumb only if we could get multiple finger support for example allow us to shoot in right and left both side so with right finger I can aim and with left I can hold it down to shoot, I hope we'll get it soon 😁 great game.",
            "It is a best app to play like free fire Advantages: *good graphics *good gun collection *good creations *good game for fighting the zombie *we can play both offline&online Disadvantage : *THere is no jumping key. So this is the only disadvantage for mee. This zombie shooting game is very interesting to play. So everyone try this game.",
            "One of the best zombie games on mobile. But, as always, half the guns can only be attained with 'Gold'. Meaning, practically impossible to attain. So, basically need to pay real money to attain, or watch tonnes of ads to play casino for a chance to get a few gold at a time. Dead Trigger 2 is no more generous either.",
            "The game is really good with graphics, Here is the bad of it.. -First the Aim side is in same side with the shooting button, thus very difficulty to manage both. -Second you have made the prices of weapons to be very high in such a way that no body can afford. -Third, knowing that we can't afford weapons, you have made the missions to be very hard really it's boring. -Fourth,at least you could design a place to hide,zombies are coming in all directions as rain and you find youself in the middle."

            "I registered as a helper. I get notifications alerting an SOS near me but when I open the app it just prompts me to fill in some data about me (which I've done correctly many times) and once I complete it and press 'next' there's absolutely no info about the alert. In other words, there's no way to help. If no one can respond to the alerts, the app is completely useless.",
            "Could be perfect, however, I see useless the whole \"Get Started\" screen every time I open the app. If I need help, I need to press the SOS button ASAP, so I think its better to not press a \"Get Started\" button first.",
            "I couldn't even try it because it only shows the test screen for the SOS button and when I try to skip it or try it, it tells me that I have to complete my profile but I can't left this screen. This is a great idea but it needs to improve",
            "Everytime I open the app, it will ask me to fill in some profile info. I have tried to attend alerts, but won't show any info after accepting them. Please fix asap; this is a great idea and initiative.",

            "This app has lots of features, but it's buggy and slow. It's the only app that syncs omnipod data and daughter's endocrinologist basically requires that we use it. But it's very hard to find food history to see how to adjust dosing. Food items in the database do odd things when you change serving sizes. Syncing is largely unreliable and often comes a couple of days late. With all of Insulet's money behind this app, I'd expect it to be lots better.",
            "Slow and buggy just like what was said either, but also trying to sync for trends? It is linked with the cloud why do I need to sync with anything else? Also syncing with cloud once at midnight really isn't enough.",

            "Two is what you get!! I'm pissed right now with the bugs on the dunk game. It's been several times when Im in the middle of a dunk and matter fact, nah I'm giving yall one star. Why is it trying to connect to my FB account in the middle of a dunk? Then, when it finally load up. Boom!!! No more dunks, no more points. Yet, you want me to spend cash on this trash here, for me to lose it. Nah bruh!!!! I'm good. #facts",
            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed 😞",
            "I Love This Game!!! If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# 😱 Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! 😀 By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review√",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "Okay, let's talk about da graphics, da graphics are really great next da controls, they are very easy to get the hang of. And the fact that you can draw your own characters is lit! One one tiny bit problem . When I was about 5 years old I found out of this game it was easy for me....TIME TRAVEL 5 YEARS IN THE FUTURE . I installed it again and u had to PAY FOR THE HOLE GAME but the game is still cool !👍🏻😀",
            "This game is really fun. The graphics are awesome, puzzles are promising, and the story is very... cool. The only regret I have is I wish I could continue the game. Every time it goes to level select, it kicks me out. I tried many times, believe me, many. If u could fix this, that will be AWESOME.",
            "So I had this game for a while now but I tried to play draw below but it cost money so I bought it and then I start to load it and it makes me retry 3 times and then stays still and doesn't go up but the game in general is good and relaxing just fix that problem please and the team did a good job on the game.",
            "The game is kinda easy to beat but... really fun, the graphics are ok, the move ment kinda hard though, it got touch screen, u should do a join stick not a touch screen, but most of all the game is good, like the easiest boss is the giant snake one, and one last thing can u do what my name says please i would really appreciate it thanks.",
            "The game itself is really cool, graphics are great and the controls are simple. I have been using art work from the epic 2 gallery. Creative game. This game would be fun for children to age's 4 and 8. But the one problem is when i open the app and click play it shows the loading screen then when the loading is finished it shows an ad and after the ad it closes the game automaticly. Also i have been using the one boost app to fix it and play but it still keeps doing it. Please fix this Hitcents."

            "Very very nice",
            "I've been practicing yoga for 6 years..... I love these exercises' for a great morning wakeup! Two suggestions, when running a sequence, put a  5 or 10 second break between exercises to allow the student to get into position. Also on a couple of video shots the instructor moves out of the frame. other than these minor glitches, over all it is very good."

            "The content of the app is great, and it is very easy to navigate. My main issue with this app is that regardless of WiFi signal or mobile data coverage, videos stop to buffer regularly - often at the most inconvenient times! If I have to sprint for one minute, I don't want an additional minute or two while the app buffers! I don't believe Apple customers have this issue, yet we all pay the same!? Fix the glitches and allow Android users to preload workouts.",
            "No where near the iOS app. The bike and tread are Android based, this app should be much better. If you don't have the option to use iOS don't waste your money with a subscription at this point. The options available on iOS (workout plans and preloading to limit data use and buffer)are far superior to what is offered here. If they valued our time and money like they do iOS this would be a great app. Don't waste your time.",
            "Major bug with the videos!!! Dev team please fix. Each time we try to do an exercise the video continuously buffers at random points. I have been playing 4K videos on Amazon Prime on my phone and have had no connection issues. Love the content but incredible unrelaxing during a yoga session when the prerecorded stream buffers randomly! I have purchased a subscription so this needs to be fixed or I would like a refund as its unusable! May i suggest downloadable content like Nike Run?",
            "What is there to say about Peloton and the instructors that live inside this magical app except that its pure genius. Every class you take it feels like you're right there with them. They know exactly when you feel like giving up and will call you out on it. The workouts make sense and the music adds a whole other level to it. Most times its just stock music and it does not inspire. These guys have the best of the best, music is key. Well done!",
            "Android app is the worst I've seen. Why is it that i cannot see my own challenges or see those that I'm following? Why can I not see the same details as that on the Apple app? Do peloton and apple have a partnership so android gets pushed to the side? A major enhancement to this app is needed! Even the app on roku is terrible. Poor IT management @ Peloton...along with questionable leadership. Get ur act together!"

            "With the latest Halloween Event and Staff Training Event there are glitches and it won't let you complete them. You only have a certain amount of days to play them. I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

There's only ads in the menu which you can skip straight away and they don't interfere while you're working out like other similar apps. Only pay wall is for advanced training sessions which I personally will pay for once I've finished intermediate. Great job.

            "This app is the best for me out of 4 I tested: -widget \"as I want\" is available with an affordable ($3) ONE OFF (others had rec fee!).I wanted a discreet widget from which I could directly quickly top-up my intake. Widget has several options to customise :) -easy to use, customise cup size, daily goal.. can also have \"standard\" goals based on gender, weight, active lifestyle -achievements for motivation Suits me very well :) Would love integration to GoogleFit or MyFitnessPal :)",
            "Real simple and easy water tracker. Appreciate the ability to customize the water size and the widget is super useful to access from my home screen. The notification helpfully has the ability to add water from the pop up, but I wish it wouldn't open the app up automatically when you click it. It would make things easier if you could just add water from the notification when it comes up, then continue without interruption. but besides that, it's useful and practical.",
            "Good, helps and always reminds me to drink water. I do have a suggestion for the widgets though, can you make them add an amount of water to your daily goal without opening the app? The widgets are kind of just a display of your intakes but isn't really that functional. Also please make it able to write your water intake the previous days, because I just installed the app but it doesn't let me because I have not installed the app in those days yet.",
            "I am a water drinker everyday all day long and my doctor told me I was drowning my organs due to the amount of water I was consuming. This app helps me keep track of my intake that I show my doctors. Great app",
            "I like this app a lot because the app will remind you to bring the water I think you will install the app and you guys can decide the notification sound I think you will install this app install and great the app thank you but first I am telling you one thing when you do not get notifications you can comment in the Google Play store and they will tell you what to do one time I just get like that problem then i tell them they solve it ok bye my dear friends ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺"

            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! 😁😁",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

        "description": "COVIDWISE is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Department of Health (VDH).  The app was developed in partnership with SpringML using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API framework created through a unique collaboration between Apple and Google.\r\n\r\nYour personal use of COVIDWISE will significantly help inform Virginians suspected of having been within close proximity to someone with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. When you download COVIDWISE, you are doing your part to efficiently and effectively help your community stay ahead of any potential resurgent trends in cases. This is vitally important as the business sector, healthcare industry, K-12 schools, institutions of higher education, religious organizations, sporting/recreation activities, and others rely on appropriate interventions to ensure the health of our communities and maintain economic viability. \r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Works: \r\nIf someone reports to the app that they tested positive, the signals from their app will search for other app users who shared that signal. The BLE signals are date-stamped and the app estimates how close the two devices were based on signal strength. If the timeframe was at least 15 minutes and the estimated distance was within six feet, then the other user receives a notification of a possible exposure. No names! No location! \r\n\r\nThe BLE framework within COVIDWISE will run in the background, even if the exposure notification app is closed. It will not drain the device battery at a rate that would occur with other apps that use normal Bluetooth and/or are open and running constantly.\r\n\r\nHow COVIDWISE Protects Your Privacy:\r\nVDH takes your privacy and confidentiality very seriously. This is why we chose to use the Apple and Google BLE framework. No personal data or location tracking occurs within this app. In fact, there is no need for VDH to know where or who you are for COVIDWISE to work. If you are close enough to another app user, the BLE technology will share signals with that user. \r\n\r\nLaboratory results for all persons who test positive for COVID-19 are sent to VDH. This is not associated with the app. Our staff follows up with persons reported as positive, based on information provided within the laboratory report. As a courtesy to all app users, VDH will verify positive tests and then provide COVIDWISE users a personal identifying number (PIN). You must use that PIN in order to report a positive result to the app. This prevents people from falsely reporting positive results, which could generate false exposure notifications. VDH wants all app users to feel confident that when a possible COVID-19 exposure is received via the app, that it is a real event. \r\n\r\nIf you have the current Apple or Google operating system installed on your device, you may have noticed that Exposure Notifications are now included. You cannot enable this function until you have downloaded Virginia’s COVIDWISE app. Apple and Google will delete the exposure notification service tools from their respective operating systems once the pandemic reaches a point that public health no longer requires the use of this technology.\r\n\r\nThank you for downloading COVIDWISE!  Together, we can protect our family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, and keep Virginia moving forward!",

It would be nice if this could be resolved, I don't see why bluetooth has to considered to be part of location services. I don't see Google doing that though...",
            "Update - I uninstalled and reinstalled and notifications are working correctly now. However, please make more helpful error messages though. Older review - I get an 'Internal Error, please try again' when I try to set Exposure Notifications (I have both bluetooth and Wifi enabled - using a Galaxy S10). Please fix or give a more helpful error message so I can troubleshoot what the root of the problem is - whether it's a 'user error', phone configuration or something else out of my control.",
            "I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but for some reason it keeps turning location services off on its own? I'll randomly get a notification that my C ovidwize notifications have been enabled only to discover it hasn't been scanning for the last couple of weeks.",
            "While I understand and appreciate what the app is trying to do, the app checking my location consistently at 1am, and 3am is crazy! It is not checking my location when I am actually out and about during the day. I will be deleting this as I find that for me, it is worthless. Based on reply..let me correct that to exposure checks at 2+am, 3+am, 4+am, 5+am, do no good for me as thats when I'm home asleep. Those are the check times that have been reported to me.",
            "Bluetooth has always had security issues! Hackers can get into our phones via Bluetooth. Search Google: \"Bluetooth Unveils Its Latest Security Issue, With No Security Solution,\" ... on MSN News/Gizmodo, 9/10/2020. Also, Bluetooth constantly searches, draining batteries. I think it would be safer for the app to keep a record of where we have been for the past couple of weeks, then the VDH could use that to cross-reference to see if any app users were around an app reported Covid-19 victim."

            "Such a shame. This app was amazing, but the latest update has messed everything up. Settings are clunky, sound effects are forced on you that make a recording sound ridiculous, and the video effects on group collaborations are awful. Finished recordings often end up completely different to what you see during the preview. You've taken away all the joy of this as a musical singing app. It doesn't feel like any testing was done before releasing this latest update. Poor.",
            "Dear team smule, after the recent update, the lovely feel of the app is lost. To describe briefly, the settings in terms of reverb, room etc, are very difficult to adjust, and I have to repeatedly tap super studio, and these features just don't open up. What happened to the good old app..!! Why give us the updates which don't work? All the fun is lost now. My friends who use the app have similar issues. Kindly look into the matter and set it right please.",
            "I used to use this app a lot when I was a teenager just to entertain myself and it used to be all free and you did not need to buy a VIP subscription just to perform a solo song. This app has become absolutely atrocious and unusable. There is another app like this that I personally believe is much better, free, and doesn't have intrusive ads. They might not have the group option, but at least I don't pay $20 a month to be able to sing a solo. Obvious cash grab update",
            "It's unfortunate that you can't pick your voice effect when joining others, can't change visual effects, and it just sounds off now. Whenever you record if you click out of the voice effect to adjust volume of your voice you CAN NOT go back to the effects. It needs fixed. Used to use it a while ago and recently got back on. Glad I only subscribed to one month VIP instead of committing to a full year again. I will say I like the globe and seeing where the other person is joining from.",
            "I will change my rating if they fix the issues with the app. The recent update messed everything up for me, not sure if its because I have a Samsung. Anyways, I can't make videos anymore because the audio and video don't match like others have said. I also dont like the new options and singing styles. They made everything too complicated. Its not fun anymore which makes me sad. I used to love this app, but the new version is terrible. Please fix it!"

But when it does it makes me really mad and then it's really hard to try and fix without it pausing and going again and it doesn't have a couple of songs that I really like but other than that this is a great app speaking of which I'm actually listening to music from your app right now called karma😅😂but I do recommend this app and it doesn't include any signing in and it's actually free!!",
            "I honestly love the app. No ads to interrupt the experience, and you can add 1 song to a playlist to keep looping it. And you can add songs from other apps! I recommend the app to anyone who enjoys listening to music while also using other social media apps and games! Though, the only thing that bugs me is if there is 1 spelling mistake in the search, it wont give you results. Other than that, I love the app!",
            "THANK YOU!! dude theres NOTHING wrong with this app and ive been looking for something like it for a long time! Ive had this app for a year now and the ads arent annoying at all!

            "Definitely recommended. Highly. I've found a lot, if not, all my music here. It even plays the music over apps as you play games. No bugs, glitches, or audio issues. This is the perfect music app in my opinion with no confusing navigation.",
            "I love this app! I didnt know how to create my own playlist at first but I eventually figured it out after a few months of use. Awesome app! Except for one problem. Ads ads ads. Too many ads. Wish I could give 4 and a half stars though. But its still awesome. Another thing. I discovered the music keeps pausing and playing."

I'd slacked on using it for a while, & let me tell you... I was really feeling a lot better about myself & my life when I was consistently making time for this. I need to really shave my budget rn, & intended to cancel the Premium version, but I just used it again this morning, & it offers SO much. If you actually *use* it, I think $10/mo is actually a steal. ❤",

I haven't slept this well in over 2 decades, and I can't remember when I felt this much hope. Thank you so much!",
            "I have a few different categories chosen. When I entered the app today to continue my sessions there was a recommended lesson that wasn't there yesterday or the day before. I'm already listening to 4 different lessons, and the recommended lesson REMOVED a one that I was actually listening to DAILY, causing me to have to search the app for the lesson that was removed. I cant even remove the recommended lesson. If I wanted another lesson, I would search for it myself. I can't save my lessons :/",

            "To be honest a lot of post on here about the game(mobile strike) being pay to win is pretty much 80% acurate there are some times your base is better but then there comes the dude that spent $20 more than you and just claps all your troops the game has alot of potentail but is already a failing game just becuase the game devs just want so extra money. So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",
            "Cost to much ti play i have been playing this game for years i spent alote of money on it and the change up to cyber we that were playing before that had to spend much more and the stuff we bought before we cant even use even the game packs have alote of stuff but there is 80%of it is stuff u cant use note that we should have renberse use for what we paid for and lost cause of the change up",
            "Game is good, but when you start you encounter bullying by way of dealing with continue killing of your troops. Get a good alliance an you can build up. For starters slow to building up but worth the challenge.",
            "I played this several years ago and purchased quite a few packs. I have tried to download this recently and due to extravagant changes to the game, it will not even download. Disappointed.",
            "Just got the game today and already seems to be a lag in the game. Not sure whats going on, internet is working its just the tutorial part of it."

That's just not cool needing to pay $19.99 for an amazing character. | Overall great game, gameplay is good skills too, needs a bit of work with Gem availability, though.

            "In general this app is helpful. I have one objection - too much focus on disease! A passage that could say, \"to keep your kidneys healthy avoid theses foods\" starts out with this ramble - \"If you have bad kidneys\" \"There are many risk factors for kidney disease\" and just goes on and on planting disease, disease, disease. Do you think you could make the focus and suggestions move in the direction of healthy kidneys...?",
            "I am very disappointed with this so called app.This book really doesn't cover anything except kidney stones and that is anecdotal at best! Forget trying to find out about anything else. In an immature manner benefiting no one but a complete moron, the language of this app is degrading. The sections described only briefly the diseases. Barely covered (if at all) are various ailments of the kidneys. Even if a disease or condition is mentioned, what is said about it is minimal. This app even suggests that kidney disease can be cured which is not the case. Kidney damage is permanent and if severe enough will lead to dialysis or total kidney failure. I think I am giving this app two stars out of the kindness of my heart. I would not recommend this app to anyone except an elementary school student of middle grade.",
            "Too many and too frequent add updates, which makes the page one is reading jump all over the page. Since there is no option to pay for an add-free version, I simply uninstalled this annoying piece of junk.",
            "I have to use this app and practice the natural way to keep my and my familys kidneys healthy. My better half had a kidney transplant, it was eye opening to see how many people are suffering from kidney disease. if you can keep your kidneys healthy now, you are saving yourself/loved one from 30 hours a week in a dialysis clinic. It's unimaginable how many people are in some state of kidney failure. We need to prevent this disease becoming our future. Start here naturally ♡",
            "The author of this app really works hard to update frequently & cover all topics in re kidneys. Sometimes the writer is too simplistic & does not use the best grammar"

            "I feel like this is a really good app, gives me a little bit of responsibility by waking up my buddy and gets me to go out and do simple but meaningful tasks. It also tracks everyday on a calendar so you can see how you've been doing feeling wise and has a journal page, etc. Wish I could interact with the buddy a bit more though. Great app, keeps me going, even on tough days.",
            "I've been using this app on and off for years now, it's simple to use with no ads and a good paced system that engages you to check back every day. I personally love the nostalgic feel of the graphics + it's easy to run because it's not super detailed. it focuses where it matters most with gentle reminders here and there to make sure you're taking care of yourself. I would recommend this app to someone who needs it. if you're unsure, get it. you can uninstall if it's not for you. stay safe! <3",
            "This is a good app for keeping yourself safe mentally, so I find it quite useful. However, I think that the designs of the buddies and UI isn't as clean and pretty as I would like which puts me off using it at times, but that's probably just the visual arts student in me being nitpicky 😖",
            "Great app. In the favorite coping method section, can they be sorted by category (like in the general list of coping methods, but it would only show your favorites) to make it easier to find what I'm looking for. Or at least not have multiple instances of a certain coping method. If the same method is in more than one category and I favorite them both, there is multiples of different methods and it gets cluttered and repetitive",
            "I am blown away. First recommended to me by someone on a crisis text line. I've had it for a week and it is FANTASTIC. I have been keeping more healthy habits because the app makes me feel like I'm achieving something. The journaling section helps me to find joy in little things and expose me to self-commpassion, which is difficult for me. I also love that it has coping skills for almost EVERYTHING, plus a crisis plan. Oh and guys, this app is actually FREE! no in app purchases!"

The texting feature is one of the major reasons I signed up for Talkspace, but I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth since my therapist does not respond for 8-12 hours. When she does respond, she just says she has some ideas that could help me, but that she will share them during our next session, making me wait several days for any sort of lifeline! I need help now! I'm paying for this service! On another similar therapy app, I was able to message back and forth with my therapist and get instant feedback. As for the video chats, I would have preferred if my therapist would have been stationed in one place the whole time instead of walking around her house. It was a bit unprofessional and even when she was sitting down because she had a tv on somewhere in the house and she was moving the camera all around making me sea sick. To make matters worse, I had no way of knowing if anyone at her house could hear our conversation! She had a lot of experience as a therapist, but admitted that she was new to Talkspace and had not yet read all of the handbook and all the rules she was supposed to follow as a provider. When we got booted out of our video call three times, she suggested that we FaceTime. Again, not professional! Talkspace is a secure platform where mental health information can be shared. FaceTime is not! I'm going back to the other app I was using before. It was slightly more expensive, but wayyyy better!",
            "Do not waste your time or money with this app. My therapist has been really wonderful and responsive, but the app is absolute trash. I reached out to support and the only response I received was, \"We've received your support request, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.\" That's it. No actual response to my concern. I can't book new sessions because I \"don't have any session credits available\" and there's no obvious/visible way for me to even pay to book another session. To top it off, the sessions that I have booked with my therapist have been such poor quality that I am literally talking to a blank screen because her face never shows up, despite us both having very fast internet connection speeds. I'm really disappointed in the general usability of the app, the complete lack of customer service, and the quality of the calls between me and my therapist.",
            "The issue has been resolved. Thank you! I was charged a total of 8 times in one month and still have not heard back from customer service or been issued a refund. On top of that, the app is still behaving as if i haven't renewed my subscription despite having taken 8 monthly charges out. If customer service ever reaches out and resolves the issue then I will change my rating because I love my therapist, but I dont like being multi-charged for a service I am not receiving.",
            "Received an invite link to this service. The first therapist told us they could not accommodate video sessions, which is what we paid for. The second therapist did not respond to any messages. Talkspace seems unable or unwilling to provide the service we paid for."

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

It's that, instead of writing brand names of the medicines if you would write the composition/pharmacological names of the same then it would be much better and easily understandable.",

That was a few hours ago ive come back and now some of the songs i made are gone (i think the app updated) which is really disapointing because i really liked some of those if you could get the songs i lost back then my rating will change to 5 stars",
            "This app has alot of cool updates but I can't do any of the songs. It says it can't play. But 1 day I used the app. And it finally work!!! But when I save the song I sang on rap mode. I can't even hear my voice singing the vibe. it kind of sucks. So I give it a review",
            "Worst app ever ! It doesnt even record my voice and says everytime that app needs more of your voice to give better results.",
            "This app has seriously improved in the past couple of years, I'm impressed.",

            "I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads, from getting character and after finishing a level, It even gives you an ad when you die, and the fact that the VIP offer shows up and it doesn't let you exit so I have to exit the game to just get past that, And it's not worth money just so that I can play with no ads and a pigeon skin, not to mention the ads are 30 seconds long, to sum it all up this game really needs to just stop spamming the ads.",
            "This game is a lot of fun! I love playing it in my spare time, but I cant stand the range of the hooks. I could be in a range where the stickman could hook onto and it would hook on to the hook behind it. This is a problem because I have tried it on multiple devices and all of them had the same problem. Thats the only thing I think needs to be fixed, though.",
            "this is a super concept but There is far too many ads. I agree with a little advertising.. that's where the money is. Here, however, there's two or three ads for every level of play. About 3x the ads . Leaving me bored and frustrated watching commercials. So much so that I dumped the game.",
            "It's a good game! The levels are fairly unique and I appreciated that. My one note would be the ads. It's not that many (I don't think it's a cashgrab) but if you find them annoying as I did, turning off your wifi eliminates all of them. Five stars for entertaining me for a few weeks.",
            "It is an AMAZING game. First, super easy controls. Second, nice short levels so not too tricky. Third, can play against others. My only problems are that there's too many ads and some of the skins take ages to get. If you could make some skins a bit easier to get and made less ads I would give 5 stars. Other than that I highly recommend this game."

But they don't, they just encourage you to skip to another game with no unwanted ads. EDIT: raised one star, cause i like moto games",

If I want to start watching prime time etc from the beginning, I have to go alllll the way back through all the episodes.. When catching up on nxt i have to close my eyes while scrolling through all the epispdoes (in reverse) to avoid spoilers. Also open up the vaults already! More coliseum videos, and other old footage you have possesion of.. No one cares if its not in HD we just want to see it.. Crockey Cup 1987 !!",
            "Love WWE Network! I can watch anything from WWF/WWE, WCW, ECW, NWA, all the territories, etc. It is so amazing! Also love all the original WWE shows exclusive to the app. If you love wrestling like I do I can't imagine my life without this app in it. I watch it everyday. For example I just binged every WWE Monday Night Raw from 1998 and just started 1999 season! UNREAL!!!",
            "Could be a lot better, I was still getting ads even though I'm a subscriber, I can't listen to shows in the background as if you leave the app it pauses the video you where watching the app needs significant improvements because of how much it's missing when compared to other streaming services",
            "I love the network..ive never had a problem with it and have been a member since 2014..how come its not letting me go on it. Ive refreshed a bunch of times and have gotten the same results which has been just lag and errors. Please help a loyal fan and customer out. Thanks",

            "That's not the problem? I can't inline myself with the songs. I quit my VIP because I still can't fix the microphone issue? I tried doing what you said and it still isn't working. When I sing, I hear my voice but it's to slow for the song. It has a second relapse. You keep updating changes and once upon a time I could fix it. Now I can't. I am not paying my monthly subscription until this is fixed on your side.",
            "Very nice app I don't know singing but this apps sound is loveable and just ossum sometimes the sound of the music helps to sing the next line .when somebody first time install the app the app gives the option of the duet with singer and with the actress ,it helps totally energetic anybody to sing the song .I a teen aged girl ,I love sing different types of songs ,I look for some thing that can help me to sing the song ,then I communicate with my friends and I know that this app is just ossum.",
            "5 stars, much better than Smule in my opinion! The people are so nice, and getting VIP here is so worth it! A bazillion songs to pick from, each one is amazing quality! Thank you for this awesome app! I will add, this app is hard to wrap your head around, but it took me about a day to figure it out.",
            "This app is indeed for singing but sometimes if we wanna sing the songs we like why do we need to become VIP. Can't we just sing without paying money. Coz to become VIP we need to pay. So sometimes it's very annoying. But this app is good too. I have nothing to say more but please remove the VIP system to select the song. It is so frustrating.",
            "I have no idea what happened.... The song lyrics have been cut like a lot... And usually there are a report button but I cant seem to find it at all and I believe that you take it out... So please please fix it... I love your app, i been using this app for long time already! Please do something about it"

            "The game is a good game, dont get me wrong. But there are 3 big things that are issues for me. One, is that the game is very complicated. There is so much stuff when you open the menu, I feel it would be better even if it was a little more \"basic\". Also, there are lots of ads, which I mean the game has to make money. Lastly, it needs a strong internet connection to play, and I feel an offline mode would be nice.",
            "I have been playing this game for over 3 years and I was just starting to get somewhere with a purchased rod and reel. The posiden rod 5 stars stats were rather good then with a successful evolution to a 6 star rod it gives me garbage stats I would expect from a 3 star rod and no way to go back to my previous rod. The stats on evolution should be a comparison or better of the 2 rods your using to improve the one you already have. Not the garbage it gave me. You could answer your emails.",
            "Really cool option to play as if your phone is an actual fishing pole W/ phones gyro. You progress quickly & are given enough free loot to start and keep the game going as you progress to earn higher level equipment and achievements. Graphics are great, controls are very easy and straight forward. Also very accurate in the depiction of the different types of fish that you would actually catch. Game accurately depicts the fish that are indigenous to the areas you fish in the game. Overall GREAT!!",
            "If you cant play for a while you will lose your guild and all the money and hard work you put in will be give to someone on your team and they wont talk and don't fish much this suck by far thus the 1 star rating a bot in control of my guild you email for help and they tell you its nothing they can do you have to w8 till person misses 20 days or more im pissed as all hell because I worked at the hospital when rona popped up and had to work doubles i had no time to check in. I want all my $ back",
            "It should have higher quality graphics setting. Good game, but the graphics is still stuck in 2014. It doesn't look good on a FHD screen."

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "I have only been using this app for a few days and it has been very helpful. The meditations and breathing exercises are short and sweet with option sound and vibrations to help keep you on task. I am very happy with the journal as well! I like the option to pick emotion stickers for the day and answer simple questions vs freestyle (although you have 2000 characters for that too).",
            "I've been using this app for a little under a week and have been finding it pretty helpful so far. Haven't had the need to try out the panic button yet, so I can't comment on that aspect, but the rest of the app seems helpful. That said, I am very confused as to how I can have a \"20 day Journal streak\" when I've only had the app for about five days. It's doesn't impact the function at all, but it is a very strange glitch on the gameification side of things.",
            "I have read through the information provided and found it very useful. It is very clear and easy to understand how to use the app. Even though I haven't yet taken out their paid subscription, there are still activities you can do for free. I have found so far, this to be the best Anxiety/Panic Attack App I've come across.",
            "Absolutely love this app. Would be rad if there was a chatbot like woebot or self-education quizzes to help understand ourselves & our issues. Only thing I'd change is hiding the stuff only paid users can access. Maybe prevent accidently clicking on a premium feature by having all the free features in 1 area? Being reminded we're too poor to access features that could help us, is depressing & anxiety provoking.",
            "Had an issue signing up but the rootd IT team was quick to resolve my issue. The app is very helpful and I would certainly recommend it to others that are struggling with anxiety and panic attacks."

Even though they are no longer in business (if you're wondering why you cannot connect your device) they should still allow users to access their Tracker via the UP app. and store data on their phones instead of their obsolete Servers. Sadly both are now redundant and my Tracker might as well go in the bin :(",
            "This app and company are now defunct. It's unfortunate, because this was my favorite app that gave legitimately interesting info based on walking goals. Still looking for a similar replacement.",
            "Dissapointed. Company closed their servers so the app and tracker won't work... don't waist your time to try to set it up as it will not connect.",
            "Servers are dead, rendering the bands useless unless you find a third party application that can communicate with the band. Take the app off of the store if you can't even use it. Release the source code so app developers can come out with applications that allow the use of the band. Useless.",
            "It never worked in the first place. My UP is fully charged, and I have very strong WIFI connection. I went on the app and selected my UP2, it took a good 5 minutes to load and then said I have no Internet connection. I'm super confused and sad, please tell me how to fix this problem. Edit : Looked at other reviews, and seems that the company have shut down. It's a real shame."

            "This game is fantastic! Normally I don't rate and review games, but I felt I should on this one. There are very very few bugs or glitches (and the one that I know of actually helps you out lol). That said, I do have few critiques. Sometimes the level will finish before the player stops moving, and it would also be convenient if the level wouldn't end until the play stopped taking damage altogether. Please fix!! Again, I absolutely love this game, but if this is fixed I'll add another review: 5⭐",
            "it's awesome they added rocket vehicles... but I have some request so I can enjoy it even more, the first request would be that they add more things for editor mode including • More materials • More space • And maybe add something that can select something so we can select more than one thing and paste it... *BONUS* if they want they should add a bit more cars. Thanks also I am really happy about this game it's really fun so if you could do me that favor I would be happy.",
            "Great game! But I think there needs to be like a \"second eject\" button where if you get stuck on an obstacle you can free yourself without losing progress. I got stuck and let it go for 5 minutes and ended up with a score of over a billion, but unfortunately had to reset completely and lost it all. It'd be great if there was a function where we could free ourselves and keep that high score.",
            "I freaking LOVE this game. You start off on a staircase and you launching yourself off of it, and it just gets funnier from there. when you eventually get enough coins to get the custom level maker, it is so hilarious. Love it 5 stars",
            "Good game but would be nice to have more map editing tools maybe even map sharing and more cars or a vehicle maker that would be cool people can make they're own cars. Maybe even to have multiple characters in the same car and also can this auto stop feature that caunts from 3 to 1 whould be nice if it whould be toggled so you can make more cool stuff its really annoying sometimes"

            "Love this. Brilliant app for tracking workouts at the gym. Developer, is there any chance that you could add a feature where the timer function goes to a negative timer if you run over your rest time period, so you know how long over your rest period you've gone? So if I select a rest time of 30 seconds. But I rest for 45 seconds. The timer would read -15 seconds. Hope that makes sense! Thanks for reading. Matt.",
            "A great fitness app. Love seeing the graphs of lifts and the breakdown of parts of the body hit by the exercises. The use of this app alone has allowed me to push my self harder and get better lifts. It is great to see the past data and get over the psychological barrier of a lift when you know you have the data to back up the jump in weight. Overall phenomenal app and I'm super happy with it",
            "Best app for tracking gym and cardio hands down! Really straightforward and simple to use, dont even need instructions. Best of all gives more stats about you than you even need! Love this app! Please dont stop developing. For improvements maybe make widgets, possibly showing improvements for each body part? Also maybe smart watch support",
            "Really like this app. Edited on 9/23/2020 I've been using this app for over a year now and find its the best workout log app I could find. I tested quite a few others but they all have their flaws. I really like how you can easily access your history for each exercise so you know what weight to use and how many reps you need to do for a PR. I also like how they allow you to create full routines, unlike other apps which just allow you to create a individual days or workouts.",
            "Great app! I've been using it since 2016 and the features are extensive yet so easy to use. Being able to chart really helps with seeing progress and motivation. It's fun to say that lifted 1 million pounds last year, or that I did +600kms of cardio... all with pretty charts! I just had to register as a supporter. Hoping one day other apps can integrate with this one such as Google, Samsung, Huawei and Runkeeper."

Judging the free version only, I can say it's mostly an ig-like, fitness-centered social network with a pretty nice community for what I've seen. I may apply for the payed version in the future, so for now I don't feel like giving 5*, not until I see the full version.",

Never opened this app again and today got a charge from over 100$ for something their own support said I shouldn't worry about Don't use this app",

            "Too many bugs. Too slow. Icons don't always work. Videos stall. Can't move the cursor to correct a typo unless the arrow keys are used. Notifications of comments are sent but comments can't be viewed. Profile is updated but info disappears no matter how many times it is entered and saved. I emailed developer and asked what the difference is between the free app and paid app (which is expensive) and got no answer. There are plenty of free apps on the market that work better than this."

Unfortunately, on my Samsung A50 the text on the larger widget does not display properly (it is too high for its container so you cannot read it). Also both widgets are way too short - they use very little of the screen height that they take up / occupy.",

Though it never sends me the reminders like it's supposed to but that's okay. I like to look at the app anyway to see. I think it's a cool app.",

            "You should also add an option where users can sell their unused equipments to add in their funds so that it won't turn into waste after upgrading. And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

Fonts are small enough to display a lot of information on the cellphone, yet is still readable. It's easy to set past dates (e.g. birthdate) without copious scrolling. Unlike some apps, the graph displays a range of greater than 30 days; to also be able to display a custom range would be helpful. Ads are unobtrusive but aren't in premium. Also with premium, the app syncs across multiple devices.",

            "Pros: Good system with good songs Can fit an infinite amount of players into the same room. VIP can have access to all songs, and an infinite amount Cons: 24 hour wait time to play 1 song, up to a maximum of 2 songs. This means to play 2 songs, you have to wait 2 days. I understand it's a free trial for the VIP pass, but I think it should be 12 hrs, not 24. Songs cost coins, which I'm sure would be fine if there was a way to earn them. VIP costs $5 for 1 day, up to (I think) 100 for 1 year.",
            "I have been playing this game a lot of times and it's really great. But now, I can't start the game when I'm connecting with my laptop with my Android phone. It always said can't start after I pressed the dance button😭 Now, I found it's just not working with latest Chrome Web browser on MacBook. It works good with Safari and other laptops with Chrome Web browser. Could you please fix this? Then I will give back my 5 stars.",
            "I paid 10 dollars for nothing!!!!! I cannot join the dance room and everytime this error occur, I have to uninstall and reinstall. It so frustrates me. Its been 20 days and there is no update or solution from developer. I beg for refund and they refused. I don't want to give you any star if I can!!!!!! #bad bad bad bad",
            "I could not belive this!!!!! first thing is that when i went in somehow months ago ,i already install this game then in this month, when suddenly my game data is gone!!!!!!then after that ,when i went out it gone black then i don't know why !!!!!!(i really don't know i like before and not now)i just really want to play just dance",
            "Horrible! I redownload this since I got a new phone and things have changed. For the worst! First of all, you HAVE to go through this STUPID \"tutorial\" where they have limited options of songs to chose from. Now, I understand business, I know not everything fun can be free. However, if you are going to make me pick from like 10 ANNOYING songs for this MANDATORY first dance, WHY ARE YOU CHARGING 100 COINS?!?! I HATED the new look and system and I'll be uninstalling. Thanks for nothing!"

The more MONEY you spend, the more you can HARASS others. Not the most elaborate strategic war games I've seen but its ok. Gets a little boring with all the waiting around. Horny sounding and looking animated girls narrate the game progress. Whatever floats one's boat...",

Like, it unecessarily cuts my 1500 game golds in the name of HQ transportation, when I tried to transport it to a nearest place of my guild member. After deducting the above amount, it simply says it cannot be done due to some kind of boundries. I mean, which type of game is this when I am unable to help my team members, couldn't arrange a rally or be a part of it? Seriously, a lot more work is required to improve this game.",

As far as I can tell, there are very minor differences, such as you can't choose the United Kingdom, Helena isn't available in the beginning, and Pandora is now Chimera (though a lot of the spoken dialogue still references Pandora). Really lazy re-skin, but that music makes all of the difference. Stick with KoW is you've put any significant time in it, otherwise play this for the awesome music. Oh, and zombies!"

            "I straight up didn't install this app. I've never used it or opened it either but it was taking up lots of my battery (about 1% which is a lot for an app that I have literally never opened). I'm assuming my provider (Verizon, surprise, surprise) downloaded this app automatically during an update to my phone which is fantastic, since I was never alerted of this (read: sarcasm).",
            "Complete Battery Hog. I have to disable the web protection settings or it chews up my battery life in a matter of hours. According to my battery usage stats, Verizon's \"anti-virus scanner\" uses up more battery than Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Mobile Games. On some days, Combined. Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "I have been a subscriber with VERIZON for about 14 yrs. I have been more than satisfied with the cell svc, their products they sell, the support teams, and most of all the protection products they offer. This particular app is of the highest quality out on the market. Can't go wrong with this one!!!",
            "This is trouble some to me I have a 1 in the app window all of the time I do not know what to do of the 1 in the app window need help clearing the 1 in the app window . Cause of this happening to people much in proving is needed to correct the problems with this app here????? Unknown if app window problem location/link & intternet problem double check from your end.",
            "Since the app was installed i cannot access my printer to print emails from my phone. This app sucks. I originally thought it was my printer now I am finding out it is my phone. I have been a Verizon customer for years. I am considering a switch to another company."

Really really love this game but i have some problems and I am requesting your team to clear it, I play 10 hours per day but most of the time would be wasted while the loading before and after matches. Please make it fast and the most important problem is that, the storage of items is limited and they would expire in 2 weeks.

But i am giving 2 star rating because i opened so many premium lootcases i even bought some but never got a 4 star superstar this game is biased they give superstars to only those who spend money on this game...This game doesnt deserve money its a fun game i hope u got my point.",

Asks to close app or wait for response. I this many of users also have the same problem. Even i mailed to Jiosaavn help. But problem doesn't solve. This issue isn't only one of my device i tried 3-4 devices which have. Then also same problem persist.",
            "At least earlier, the ads would play in between the songs. And that was at least bearable. But now, the ads just start playing anytime, doesnt matter if you are in the middle of a song. Also, the cheap tactics of not giving a cross button for banner ads too. Saavn is just giving too many stupid ads now. Gonna uninstall for sure if this goes on for another 15 days.",
            "Guy's if you don't have any subscriptions of this app.Then you have get a bunch of adds on this app.and now a day's this is happening so much and also it get so much of time to loading a song.and now when you update your app and you are the old user of this app then you can't set any caller tune on this app. If you want to set then you have to purchase a pro subscription.which gives benefits a callertune,no adds,etc.(This is my personal opinion.And this review is on the basis of what i face it)",
            "Great App, but Improvement Needed. I'm actually one of the fans of this app! The way you bring some important songs I've been searching for quite long time and you guys will always have satisfied me with your Classic to Modern collections! One more suggestion: Please help us out with CALLER TUNE REQUESTs...! I've given so many requests to set my fav songs (famous too!) But no response from you guys! Please resolve this fast! 🙏🏽🤩",
            "Lots of songs not available for hello tune, compare to other music app this app sound quality is not good, variety of songs not available especially for hello tunes. In wynk music there's an preview option for hello tune. We can preview the song and set the hello tune. JioSaavn have to improve the sound quality and also Hello tune options."

Or make 3 defensive plays and catch fire on defense. I think the this will give a boost. Better rewards for getting to the playoffs and winning the finals. When you win the finals and start a new season and you don't get a ring, what's the point? Give more incentives. Make a kobe bryant leaderboard to tracks how many rings you get!",
            "This is a great game. I would reccomend this game for any NBA fan. The controls are very smooth and are easy. The graphics are great, but they don't look exactly right. I like that you can choose your own franchise. The packs that are in the store are pretty expensive, but what you get in them is worth it. There are old players, as well as some new ones. Some old ones are Allen Iverson and Ray Allen. Some active ones are LeBron James, Steph Curry, and James Harden.",

I love this game, i play it constantly, but damn, yall have to fix this, it is beyond annoying and prevents me from building my teams.",
            "Requested a refund because of an unauthorized purchase, and EA refused to send a refund. They always took a long time to respond to emails, and often just sent the same message back, which was very little help. They also kept telling me I had to ask Google for a refund, but then Google sent me back to EA. It was like the 2 of them were playing ping pong and I was the ball, just going back and forth. Would not reccomend playing this game or spending any money whatsoever.",
            "While the graphics and gameplay is fun, to get anywhere real you need to pay a lot of money, as are all typical EA games. But there are some conection problems and I can only fathom about telling you how many half court shots the opposing AI has made in crucial buzzer beater situations. Imagine about an hour of grinding just wasted because of that. Multiple times. Other then that, I suppose it's okay."
