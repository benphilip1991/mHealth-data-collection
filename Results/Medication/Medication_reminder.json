But MyTherapy is more than a free medication reminder: Combining a pill tracker, mood tracker and a health journal, e.g. with a weight tracker, this medication reminder app allows you and your doctor to put your treatment‚Äôs success into perspective. ‚è∞ üíäüîî\r\n\r\nüíäKey Features \r\n‚Ä¢ Pill reminder app for all medications\r\n‚Ä¢ Pill tracker with logbook for skipped and confirmed intakes\r\n‚Ä¢ Support for wide range of dosing schemes within medication reminder\r\n‚Ä¢ Track your tablets, dose, measurements, activities as a comprehensive health journal\r\n‚Ä¢ Family sharing\r\n‚Ä¢ Share your printable health journal with your doctor\r\n‚Ä¢ Personalized tips for your treatment\r\n‚Ä¢ Wide range of measurements for all conditions (diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, depression, hypertension, multiple sclerosis) e.g. weight, blood pressure, blood sugar levels\r\n\r\n‚è∞Comprehensive meds reminder \r\nWe designed a medicine reminder app that puts all your medication needs in one place: Pill reminders (e.g. for birth control pills), a comprehensive database of OTC and Rx medications, support for any dosage form (tablet, pill, inhalation, ‚Ä¶) frequency, and even refill reminders. And as the app is not only a pill alarm, but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you‚Äôve taken that important dose. \r\n\r\nüíäA health tracker for your needs \r\nMyTherapy is the result of us closely working with people taking medications. People with diabetes use the built-in weight tracker and keep track of their blood glucose. Also, they use it as logbook for insulin and a medication reminder for Metformin etc. The built-in mood tracker supports you to keep track of your mental health or depression. Review your health using the blood pressure log, your mood diary or other aspects of your health journal. MyTherapy can be a different app to many, with some using it as depression app while others refer to it as stroke app, cancer app, or weight tracker.\r\n\r\n‚è∞A tracker for mood, weight, blood pressure and more \r\nYou can not only log your meds, but also track your mood and general well-being in the app‚Äôs mood diary. Record measurements e.g. blood pressure and weight. If you are living with diabetes and are on Insulin, you can use MyTherapy as diabetes logbook and track blood glucose. Overall, MyTherapy supports ~50 measurements. The app‚Äôs symptom tracker is popular e.g. with users living with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or cardiovascular diseases such as Atrial Fibrillation.\r\n\r\nüíäMotivation to take your meds\r\nReceive a beautiful picture of the day as motivation to take your medicine. Involve family and friends with MyTherapy Team and successfully manage together. And you can even have your family see if you‚Äôve missed a med despite the pill reminder, so they can help you stay on track.\r\nMyTherapy is for you, no matter if you are taking antibiotic medicines or deal with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, anxiety or depression that are often complicated. MyTherapy is medication tracker and health journal.

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help.

            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

It is simple and intuitive, it has all the features you actually need and doesn't overwhelm you with all the useless fancy features other similar apps are packed with. The overdose warning is the big bonus of this app. As for the support service, they really answer within 24h and actually listen to you. This is rare enough to give 5 stars.",
            "I have uninstalled since the last notification should have been at 10pm and the app is just trigerring an alarm every 4 hours throughout the night outside of the schedule. This is a joke of an app. Stay away from this app if you don't want to have false alarms ringing through the night.",
            "I am/was a software designer. The interface is simple and pleasant. Easy to add and schedule meds. I like being able to create different versions of myself so I can do slightly different sets if meds for different days. Good program. I would pay a onetime fee to remove adds.",
            "Excellent basic functionality. I just wanted a basic app to remind me about a medication taken once daily. I can't speak to more advanced functions, but works great as a basic reminder app.",
            "The app is helpful, but it should have an option, once you set all your medications for a certain time, to just choose all at one time and be done. It's annoying to be doing it one by one. It's ok, but not what I expected!"

For the last few weeks the reminders no longer appear, I tried to contact the developer via Google Play but I haven't had a response. I need an app that will work and provide what it advertises so unfortunately I am going to be deleting this and looking for a different more reliable app.",
            "Really helpful app. I'm recovering from an operation and have a minefield of pills to take and this is so helpful! Only annoyance is things like having to use a scrolling clock to record when you took the meds... Would be much better if I could click and enter the time!",
            "The app is set to remind me to change patches every 72 hours. It doesn't work. I don't complain when a free app doesn't work, but I paid for this one and I expect it to work. I would also appreciate it if you would m ake some kind of audible notification in stead of email. Thank you, Karen Despres",
            "I was seriously struggling to remember my medications & this app changed the game for me. I especially like the ability to change the color of the pill image to match various pills. Helps me to not mix them up.",
            "It works in that it sends a notification on rbe time that was set. However, even with the option to change the sound to a custom one, it always uses default sound. And That is not a very loud / unique sound to grab one's attention Give it a meh."

            "I have have used the free version for a few days . It works well - user-friendly and clear. It needs careful setting up, like any  app which handles your individual personal information.  I take up to a dozen medications in over 25 doses a day, so the easy to read but no fuss presentation of th is app is just what  I needed.  I have moved on to the premium version and I'm pleased with that too.",
            "I have quite a few mental health issues and have a very hard time remembering things. My phone is for the most part my memory. The app works fine for a while. Now half the time neither reminder goes off. I've missed doses. With the medication I take missing doses is dangerous. I'm having to uninstall and look for another reminder app. Turned battery optimization off battery saver not even on. Problem still there. Odd my new 1 works perfectly. You are to pushy. I will not use your app.",
            "It's almost a great app. I am disappointed that it isn't user-forgiving. When you get an alarm and take your med(s), but forget to select the medication to indicate taken, you cannot go back later and indicate you took it at the correct time. What it does is shift the schedule of that med from the time you selected, thus delaying your next dose. Update: The creator responded with an unobvious, multi-stepped way of resetting the time of taken medicine to prevent the schedule adjust process. 4*",
            "P.i.t a. The keyboard gets in the way ! EDIT* using system back button on my phone worked, (durr) Thank you! EDIT**This app is really growing on me. I love that you can snooze! Also, ads are strategically placed between times. Helpful ‚ò∫Ô∏è Q; I needed to change time on the reminder/taken screen. *Fixed Please add basic editing for the pics we take. Crop/brighten. Or, adding text to the default pics would be handy.(150mg). Especially if the person takes the same meds in different doses(75mg)Thx!",
            "reducing 2 stars coz its no longer giving reminder notifications....Track option is missing calander dates.... like 23rd to straight 30th & these are days with no notifications...& if no notifications i didnt bother to click Take button... in actual due to app not reminding.. i m getting delayed to take or sometimes missing my meds.. please fix..."

            "This, for me, is easier to use than \"My Therapy\" app. which I have used for many years but has recently become slow. I like this app because it has everything I need and the UI is very straight forward to use. It would be nice to have repeat reminder more than 6 times (like, until I cancel) as I have to use another app (Missed It) to act as a reminder. Pill Reminder is a good bit of coding and well thought out. I also like the sensible pricing option.... not much to pay for over 3 meds.",
            "4 star's cause nobody's perfect, there's always room for improvement, haven't heard the alarm the last few days, could just be me, haven't investigated it yet, but still have the visual notification, It does everything it says, would be nice to have more on free app, otherwise great",
            "It needs to have a trash can, so the meds we are no longer taking can be moved to the trash. Once that is done, you will get 5 stars. Otherwise great app. Thank you.",

Remember to take the right drug, the right way & time with this Pill Reminder.\r\n\r\nüíä Dosecast Free edition:\r\n\r\nüîî RELIABLE NOTIFICATIONS: Dosecast reliably sends dose reminders to your phone, tablet or Android Wear device and lets you postpone them, like a snooze button. If you miss the first reminder, It can nag you until you respond. It can also sound a continuous alarm.

            "This is the absolute BEST pill reminder out there and it was just made better when the last update provided the ability to move the app and the data to an SD card, freeing up memory on the phone. It still runs just as fast. Since I wrote the above I have had to replace my Samsung Android phone with a new S-20 which apparently doesn't allow moving the app to an SD card. Also I'm wishing there was a way to enter a MWF pill routine.",
            "This has been a wonderful app that helps remind me to take medicine. The continuous reminders and reminders that show up on the lock screen are essential to prevent missed dose, especially if I'm away from my phone for any reason.",
            "I've been using Dosecast for years, since I had it on my Kindle back in the day. I take a lot of meds at staggered times of day, so reminders are essential. Dosecast, even the free version, does an easy and amazing job of that.",
            "I have many medical issues, one being a stroke that affected my memory. I forget things, sometimes right after I do them. This app reminds me to take my meds including Insulin and 5 minutes later when I wonder if I took my Insulin I can check this app and see that I did. I also use this app when I go to the doctor or ER to show the staff all my meds, the strength, the dose, when they are scheduled and when I took them. This app is a life saver for me, literally. Great job Dosecast!!!!",
            "This is usually a great app, but I'm not getting reminder notifications lately. I only get reminders when I open the app to check it, then I'll get all the reminders for the previous day. This seems to have started after the most recent update. Happy to give more stars if this new bug gets fixed."

This app already has one function but it reminds for every x days. I want to be reminded every x hours during x days. Also I have to calculate the days on the calendar till the exact day for the med will last, while you could simply ask for the number of days.",
            "This app would be ok if you are only taking one medication at each notification. I take 6 different meds at 8:30. It's a pain to mark one, then have to scroll back down the list the mark the next one. And it's very hard to change the time for a med. As soon as I find another one, I will delete this app.",
            "It could be great. But the reminder only goes off one time. If you don't hear it, it will not remind you again. would be nice if it would alert every few minutes until you respond, at least a few times.",
            "I'm impressed by the sophistication of the app, and how great the level of detail is when creating medications and setting up reminders. Unfortunately this isn't matched by its usability: navigating the different sections is quite clunky. The most frustrating aspect of this app is confirming medications were correctly admnistered, using the controls inside the notifications pop-ups. These are a great idea, however they don't work as expected, which in my case resulted in inaccurate stats.",
            "It's a really good app. However I'm taking away 1 star for some annoying features. When you get the pop-up you can click you've taken it or to snooze it (cool feature) but then it takes you to the app (WHY?!), instead of going away like a normal notification. And then, whenever you wanna exit the app, it asks you for confirmation. Both things are annoying and unnecessary!"

There needs to be a way to add notes daily for each profile in case something is off about your meds, reaction, pet, ect. Perhaps as premium content. I subscribed but this is a needed feature that I don't want separate app to track notes for conditions of an illness ect. Setting up med lengths needs work. Difficult to understand",
            "Your app is giving me remainder of medicine after 20 min. That's kind of timelapse can produce serious complications for kidney patients. Do something about it. Even after using this I have to maintain a extra offline chart. That's a complete waste of app.",

            "It alarms me on time and accurately tells how many pills are left. However, customer support never responded to the several emails I sent, so I can't tell if the app has a feature to remind me to refill my medication before it runs out. That's really annoying. Why even put a feedback option in the app if they don't reply to it?",

For some reason, the schedule is set in this order \"Night, Morning, Afternoon, Evening\"  instead of in chronological order \"Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night\".  There's no way to change it and you can't trick it by setting Night at 8am followed by Morning at 12pm.  It won't allow you to use an AM time for Night or a PM time for Morning.  So every time you open the app to see what medications you need to take, your night time medications are shown instead of the current medications you need to take.  I can't count how many times I've checked off my medications as I took them and then had to go back and \"untake\" my Night meds and scroll down the list to get to the meds I was supposed to be taking.  This could end up being a dangerous situation depending on what you're taking.   Except for that issue, I like pretty much everything about the app.  The notifications show which meds you need to take and the amount.  The app has a dark theme option.  And I like that when you click on the notification, it takes you to the app and you can check off each medication as you take it instead of just a \"take all\" option."

            "This is a great idea especially during these times and for people who live in the city and have a fast life. Just one suggestion I'd like to give is that sometimes after taking their medicine people forget that they have, so they end up having the same medicine twice now this can be dangerous especially for diabetes and blood pressure medicine if it is consumed twice. So it would be great if you could add some feature in reference of that other than that it is a great initiative.",

        "comments": [
            "Upgraded from 2 to 5 stars. The problem with the mysterious 12am alarm (which this app was setting) has been fixed, so it no longer interferes with 'Do not disturb'. I think the app looks nice, is easy to use (used for a single daily reminder) and no ads.",
            "This app is nice, compact, app, with no advertising - a critical feature for any app dealing with medical anything. It's good for what it does, although I can see that any users needing more than \"4 times a day\" would find that to be a shortcoming. It's ok when it is running - alarms show in your notification for the next due date/time for a medication. However, once I was not using it, I had to uninstall it. When there is nothing scheduled in the app, it still schedules a midnight alarm every day. It also does not admit this - and Android shows this midnight item as 'next alarm', but you have no idea where it is coming from.If you have a 7AM alarm set with the clock, it will not show as 'next alarm' until after midnight. I only sorted this out by deleting my apps, one at a time, until the special alarm went away. Without this problem, this would be a four-star review. But - an app cannot be permitted to interfere with the operation of other key features on the phone/tablet, even accidentally. I will watch for a fix, but until this is resolved, this gets one star. EDIT: After dev response: I look forward to the update. To be clear, the interference with understanding of regular alarms when your app has no actual events planned is not unique to your app, many reminder apps are encountering the same thing. Perhaps you could switch to only scheduling the \"exact\" reminder when there is actually medication due in the future.",
            "Data management is good. The main purpose to download this App. is to remind to take medicines as per the prescribed tmings with the help of an alarm ring. This is missing. Not happy & satisfied with this \"no-alarm ring\" facility to maintain the timings. I will wait for two more days and the App. would be unstalled soon if not improved its performance.",
            "Easy to use, with a logical set-up. This app does exactly what I want from a pill reminder and I have not missed a single pill since starting the app. A couple of small improvements would be welcome: A pill taken after midnight counts as missed. Pills for the same prescription taken at the same time have to be individually logged.",
            "Gets the job done if you only have 1or 2 prescriptions but for people who take multiple medications at a time it is annoying to have multiple alerts simultaneously. It would also be nice to just tap \"taken\" instead of having to log each and every one. An \"as needed\" feature would be helpful."

I'm not sure if there is a way to make the reminder have a sound instead of just vibration, but if not that would be my only critique.",
            "Works well for making sure that i take my tablets on time and i like the fact that it can keep notifing you every e.g. 15mins incase you delete the notification or forget. I also think its good how you can choose the notification icon, as it makes it less awkward when it appears on your phone. The actual app isnt the best inside, not much you can do. It would be good if you could track certain things but otherwise its fine",

            "I've been using this app for years. Dare not think what might have happened to me if I hadn't. Totally reliable. It has lots of other features I don't use but I am sure they would be useful for others. I tried lots of alternatives in the beginning but this app has been brilliant from the start. Highly recommended.",
            "Loved this app until the last update. It has been working flawlessly for several years. Now I get random notices to take my medication on days that I'm not suppose to. These are meds that are not safe to take whenever... Not a problem right now but as the memory starts to fail... Update... Still the same, I get an alert about 14 hours before it is time to take my meds. They still haven't fixed this problem, yet they asked for my review... 8/2/20 update Notifications random at best, not reliable",
            "Comprehensive but complicated. If you take meds regularly this app will definitely help. For folks who only get a prescription for a run of antibiotics once a year, the complexity of setting up reminders in this app is annoying.",
            "I like the reminder for medication ability. I also recently changed from a Galaxy S8 to an S10. I was glad I found instructions for transferring all of my info (pharmacies, doctors, schedules) from the old to the new phone on website because I was initially peeved when that info did not transfer.",
            "Generally very good, and nice prompt reply when required -- I hope. Currently experiencing problems with \"post-dating\" entry, where two medications have been taken, but at different times -- it's allowing me to correct one, but not the other. -- No \"note\" field to add details of what's occurred either. If they'll help me fix this, I'll give it 5* -- I've used it for years, but with \"degenerative disorders\", life gets complicated."

So instead of the sound selection being in the settings it could be in the medication screen?  I wish also that we had the option of an am/pm clock. In addition in an upgrade could the typo of \"take in\" instead of \"taken,\" when the alarm comes up be fixed? Also it'd be nice if we could set the snooze time in the settings."

            "Excellent app! Ideal and easy to use for tracking medicine usage and particularly helpful for showing doctors evidence in taking medicines. It also stops overdosing on meds by reminding me what I have already taken in a 24 hour period which is very helpful as I have a brain injury affecting my short term memory. I can't rate this app highly enough. Brilliant and thank you!"

            "Love this app. I enter every new med I need to start before I take it and it lets me know all the potential interactions with my current meds. I first started using it after I had started a new med and had some bad interactions. Even my doctor hadn't warned me about them. I was able to request a med change and get it resolved. It's also helped me avoid several over the counter meds that I wouldn't have known not to take otherwise. There are a lot of other features, but that's the main one I use.",
            "I really was impressed with this app and all it offered. Until I spent over an hour inputting all my drugs, then got a message that the app had an update and I needed to update it, turn it off, then re-open. Upon doing so, all the descriptive info, like dosages, etc. were gone. The next day at my MD visit, I was unable to pull up a simple list of my drugs. When I put in a drug name, nothing I'd put in was available. So I'd wasted all my time entering everything. Won't do it again! Delete!",
            "Very informative,but couldn't put all of my medications in. The app didn't allow past a certain number.",
            "This app has an extensive list of available medications and medical conditions. Having the ability to list personal medications is very helpful, especially if you have 2 or more. It is great for checking medication and food interactions, as well as looking at side effects of each medication.",
            "My mother is a nurse and she uses this app so I thought I'd give it a try. I am a dietetic intern and this app has really been very informative in my rotations. I bought the premium subscription because the ad placement made the app difficult to use, but the ad free upgrade for a year is really affordable. Thank you for this app!"

            "The app works so that's three stars. But not as I intended. Maybe it's a misunderstanding on the apps name. For me, \"Repeating\" means that the alarm continues to ring until it is shut off. This alarm shuts off after a maximum of one minute. The developer's understanding of \"repeating\" is that it repeats every week. The Google calendar already does that so there is no need for this app.",
            "im using it to remind myself to stop touching my head and pluck out my hair. you can even record if you did the task or not. good for referencing your progress. would reccomend to others with compulsive habits they wish to stop. a little ugly. would like some customisability for colors at least. but i understand that can be distracting for some users.",
            "I dislike required interaction with alarms... excepting wake up alarms! :) So why a \"5 star\" rating? Premium upgrade! In addition to being AdFree, Repeat Alarm Premium upgrade has uninterrupted \"mode\"! I use multiple repetitive 5-second voice reminder/alerts which \"speak\" and immediately restore previous device activity! ...video play resumes, gmail editing (including VTT) is not even paused! Repeat Alarm Premium provides useful reminders without suffering required interruptions or ads.",
            "Very useful reminder alarms that work alongside other apps. Not sure why but a whale has appeared over the reminder screen in the last day but still. Adverts are a bit annoying but bearable considering it's otherwise a free to use the app. Thanks",
            "It does exactly as I need it to... I have premium.. it was worth it to me. Simple. Easy. Impactful. Anytime you need a reminder or an alarm, this is your golden ticket"

Have another pet that's on several meds but no meds or appts listed on her record. You can't update anything yourself - no records, just basic stuff you already know like your pet's name.",
            "Took multiple attempts to create an account without the process failing. The only error message was \"Please try again in a moment\". Then when I finally got my account created, my password didn't work. I reset it twice and still was never able to login. App simply does not work.",
            "After 3 weeks I finally gave up and dismissed my most recent appointment request. If the providers don't respond, this is essentially a place to keep a list of your pets (with a single photo). Since ther's no way for owners to add any medical info, or even a description of a pet (other than species & gender), I don't find this very useful. There are other apps that offer much better record keeping for pets. This is too dependent on the provider's management.",
            "Love it!! I find it a very useful tool. Especially during COVID. Something that would improve the experience is an \"I'm here\" button. The Panera app has it. It allows you to give a quick vehicle description and let them know you have arrived.",
            "This app has been so helpful by sending reminders related to my pet's health care. It's super easy to schedule appointments and allows me to keep all vaccinations up to date. I highly recommend this app to help anyone care for their furry friends."

Also this app started advertising on TV just after lockdown no such thing as a coincidence so it's been deleted and uninstalled.",

            "Can't really comment beyond this app was recommended so installed and no luck. Invalid email, invalid password at first few attempts then decided to try forgot password didnt like my email mail so I can't go past go. Did at first use auto populate on email address but have typed in each character individually. At a basic loss, not enough options to trouble shoot much beyond install, reinstall, email, password. ?? I will keep shopping.",
            "I like how the meds are listed, but I wish it had a built in alarm or worked with device's alarm/clock. I ended up setting personal alarms since this feature was not available.",
            "Useless app. It is down more than it works. No point in having a progress tracker for your meds when it goes down for a day or more (has not worked/would not open for the past 3.5 days for me, so I just uninstalled it), and screws your progression tracking up anyway. May be small to some (since you track and know when you're taking your meds), but it is a flawed tool in a flawed app. Very unhappy with it, liked the old app MUCH better.",
            "I love this app - it makes a world of difference in managing my son's meds post transplant. The only feature I could wish for is the ability to share updates (not just printouts) with another caregiver. The most important problem is that I can't see a way to undo marking a med as taken if I enter it by mistake. Obviously that shouldn't be easy, but it would be valuable.",
            "Just saw in an email reply that you intend to add \"health tracker\" to MyMedSchedule Plus. Thank you. it is a very valuable feature. Please don't take down MyMedSchedule until after \"health tracker\" is added so that users have a chance to migrate their data. Its now Oct 2019 and still no \"health tracker.\" Has it been abandoned?"

            "Very good. The only issue i have with it, is that occasionally the notifications stop. But there is a short manual on how to fix that. ( I'm just gonna write it down here for ppl who don't know where to find it) If that happens just go to the settings bar at the top left corner, then choose \"incoming messages\", and then to \" Do you receive all notifications?\". There you can find various settings and also how to enable the alarm again.",
            "Very good app, it's great at reminding me to take my meds and if I don't respond to the notification it'll notify me every 15 minutes until I do so it's a fantastic reminder. Cute themes, don't particularly enjoy the amount of adds but I don't need to open the app often so it works out.",
            "This app helped me remember my pills and track my period, but suddenoy the period tracking got blocked by a paywall, and ridiculous amount of unskippable ads started playing. My period is horribly irregular and I had the dates saved on this app, but i cant even access it anymore. Don't recommend. Gonna move to a different app.",
            "Use to work very well, then notifications stopped popping up, and even when I marked down that I took meds I wouldn't show in the app. Now there's unreasonable pop up ads with this. Kinda messy if you ask me.",
            "It is easy to use and actually works... The first app that I have used skipped the alarms so many times... And I was upset"

Short of uninstalling and reinstalling, I have no idea to actually get rid of it. Also, I see no way to snooze alerts or if you accidentally dismiss one, go back to it. Maybe this works fine if you've setup an account, but IMO if you're not forcing me to, it should still be functional. Uninstalling.",

            "I honestly love this app. I have used in on and off for years. I recently started using this app again this year. I have been trying to register an account with Mango, but each time I try it gives me an error of \"registration unavailable\" - every time. So 4 stars. I also wish you could add your own habits to the app. Like a custom habit that you could edit, and congifure to fit your needs. I use other apps for habits I can't track in Mango. Would be nice to be able to track it all in one place.",
            "It is great for putting your meds in and keeping track with what you eat. What it does not do is take into consideration not ALL people are glued to their phones to add the information in when it wants it. Yes you can add it in later but does not give you your points. As well as not being linked to other apps like my Samsung watch which keeps track of my steps and this app does not even register 1 step and again does not give me points. How about calories since your tracking food?",
            "This is my go to app to input my health information. It would be nice if it would connect to other apps like Fitbit, Garmin, Onetouch for glucose monitor results so i only have to input in one app and Mango picks it up. Also would be nice if reminders can be adjusted based on weekdays or weekends. I wear my watch to bed to monitor sleep and my watch buzzes at 6am on weekends because I have it programmed for 6am on weekdays.",
            "This app really pushes you to take your medication and other healthy habits of your choice. I've only used this for 2 days now but I already appreciate how helpful it is. I love the leveling system and the rewards you can get the more you stay on track. A+ app in my book. :)",
            "Have not received a reminder notification for the last 4 days. All notifications are turned on and had been working, although it had been messing up randomly prior to last update. Not useful to me anymore without the reminders."

I love how close it is to my other app, yet has more options in areas that matter. If this one keeps being better, I may consider flipping & buying into it, this app also has a better value price point. Let's hope it stays 5 Stars. üôÇ - update, I got the lifetime price, no ads. Also, it has helpful info at the start of the day. üòÅ",
            "Great and quick easy way to track everything. I suggest buying it or doing some payment because the ads are a lot. Perfect for when I need to go to the doctors and have to remember my last period. Quick symptoms check too. A lot is available without ads.",
            "I downloaded today and I love every thin about it it's cheap and affordable. You don't have to subscribe if you don't want to it's w Still will work, but since I don't like ads I subscribed.‚ù§",

            "Would give 5 starts, but it takes a long time to load. I have a brand new phone, so it's not the phone that is the issue. Other then that the app works great. I would love it if there was a dark mode for this app."

If you prefer, you have avilable the full version &quot;AlarMeds&quot;; you can also find it on Google Play Store; thus, you will also contribute to make &quot;AlarMeds&quot; a better app..<br><br>The developers of this application encourage you to give feedback about it in order to optimize and correct if necessary.",

Doctor prescrption can be added in one screen With doctor name , visit date , illness type , prescription withe multiple image attachment , patient name. If needed alarm for next visit date. 2. Seperate screen for medicine purchase date , expiry date , place of medicine , medicine store address , contact person , phone no , remarks, Qty , (patient name is opt, if not mentioned the stock can be shown separate) 3. Consolidate report for stock",
            "The app is easy to use and does come with some tips such as making sure you add to battery saving safe list. I use an Huawei handset and at first the alarms wouldn't work and I was losing my mind trying to understand why despite following advice notes. After persevering with it, It turns out this app does not work on the alarms if your \"sleep when inactive option is turned on\" you need to make sure that this option in your phones settings is turned to Never. My alarms are now coming through.",
            "For those who are looking for a option to clean up the history, you can save a backup and edit the \"appointments.txt\" with any android files explorer... then Restore your backup. How can I make to have my \"stock\" properly work? I have set it up stock and the dosage. The dosage are 2 pills, but each time I confirmed that the medicine is taken, it only decrease 1 pill from stock. Tks",
            "Nice little app! Helps keep track of the meds that keep me alive! 2 things tho... Please make the app able to deal with cutting pills in half! Doing .5 doesn't do anything to my count of pills! Also I wish it would group my meds together on the notifications rather than individual pop-ups for each pill. Thanks for the great work!",

            "This is absolutely the best of its kind. I have never seen such a comprehensive, customizable, well-designed app that serves as many functions as this one. I've already shown it to multiple friends/therapists. For those of you moaning about the cost... seriously, getting the subscription will set you back just over $2/month. I work professionally with highly impoverished individuals who do have to count every penny, but come on. Most people can shell out a couple bucks without harm.",
            "The app lets you log your mood, any symptoms you are having, and a number of factors that you think may be affecting your mood/symptoms. The default categories to log are good, but you can add/remove/edit all of the categories to fit you better. It's super easy to fill out, even when I'm not feeling well. It (sometimes) feels like I'm logging meaningless information, but then when I click on the Insights tab, it shows me tons of relevant information about which factors are influencing my mood (or any other symptom I log!). Turns out listening to music and video chats work wonders for my mood--good to know! This is also a wonderful way to record how I'm feeling over time--it lets me easily decipher long-term changes in my wellbeing, which is great information to discuss with medical professionals.",
            "I really like this app, it's easy to use and the design is nice and the ability to customize it to your needs is great. However, the syncing isn't very reliable. I have a phone and a tablet, and downloaded it on both, I tried to log in on the tablet, and only a few entries were visible. Later I went to look at the one on my phone, and half the entries are gone, and so are factors I added. I want to keep using this app, but if it's going to randomly forget things that's a problem.",
            "I have tried multiple times in the past to find a way that I could easily log my moods in a way that felt nuanced and meaningful but also flexible and customizable, but this is the first app I have ever seen that got it right. For once, I am finding it convenient to do quick check ins and even monitor my food and water intake which I never thought I'd have the patience to do. You don't have to get premium, but it's well worth it at least to support a great app.",
            "Brilliant App & well worth paying for. I wanted an app to record daily symptoms to enable me to give an accurate report to my GP. This app has everything I wanted & more. Being able to write notes by each symptom is so helpful & the insight reports are incredible. I did have a little snag when I first signed up for the free trial, but I made contact, explained the situation & James helped me to sort it all out. The app has been fantastic ever since. Thank you bearable team üôèüèªü•∞"

            "Great app, works as described after one week. I would like to SELECT MY ALARM SOUND, but as long as it works. I've been using \"Reminder\" app, with an alarm that can't be stopped, made me crazy. This alarm is short and does the trick. Ads are small at bottom and not intrusive. Nice job developers! When an app works well, is free w/ ads at bottom, I try to patronize ads if interested. Least I can do for an honest developer.",
            "The alarm part is very usefull...other apps won't really remind you with alarm and you can really miss your appointmens. I actually tried one of those for a month and it did not help to remember. Two days would go by without remembering my to do list. With this app, it can be a pain when the reminder goes on and on, but we won't miss any appointments! Thank you!",
            "Very useful app. Works well. I just had to figure out how to not get a bunch of advance notices, because to me no advance notice should be the default. But you have to go into the advance notice settings and specify you don't want any. Otherwise you get notices all day long. Overall an app I can recommend.",
            "It isn't working properly, for some reason. It doesn't let me know when I need to take my meds.. no sound.. nothing. It worked great in the beginning, but it just stopped. I have a Huawei P30 Lite. Now I have to look for another reminder app, unless someone can help me..",
            "Great little reminder app. I have to have a particular reminder go off 10x a day and this app let's me customize it how I like, including the ring tone and the ability to snooze the reminder with several options. It also has a silent driving mode, which is good for safety reasons!"

            "After a while, it is getting slower. Enter your drink, wait for the sum to update, wait for the next drink time to update, wait for the animation. Wonder what it's doing. Edit: Reinstalling fixed the lag at the cost of all records. A pity, but those records are of little consequence anyway. Next time I will try to just clear all data from the settings, maybe that will have the same effect. Edit 2: Using it for a few more months and the slowness is back. So it's time for a new flush.

My kidneys are currently thanking me as I've never drank so much water on a daily basis as I have in the past 5 days. With this app, I find I often drink my intake before required but on the occasion I got behind in my schedule... I really appreciated the app's reminder. Update 9/9/2020. I use this app every day. I always meet my goals. May actually become a habit!",

You know, writing out all those long nonsensical drug names that are difficult to pronounce and nearly impossible to spell. Of course the doctors needs this information. But honestly, I don't even want to remember those silly names, much less struggle to write them down again.\r\n\r\nSo, why not have a simple app you can carry around in your cell phone? Instead of copying the same stuff over and over again, enter the information about your medications once to the app and e-mail the list whenever you need. Easier, right?  \r\n\r\nYou bet it is. Worked for me already. Went to a new dentist recently (the old one kept raising his prices). When his receptionist gave me the medical history form, I powered up my phone and sent him my drug list with just a couple of quick clicks, right there in his office. I was prepared. You will be too, after you install this app. Might even come in handy during emergencies. \r\n\r\nThis app is designed to be easy to use. Not a lot of bells and whistles to complicate things.

            "I was getting to sleep way too late, and getting to appointments was rushed. Maybe, I thought if there was some way to get things done earlier, like a reminder? Hmm? That could get better results. This reminder app in less than a week is already getting improvements. A little less tired, and stressed, in just a few days. I am glad that I found and am using this app.",
            "UPDATE: ALARM DOES NOT STOP for several minutes, & no way to turn off! Drives me CRAZY! THREE CONTACTS TO DEV. WITH NO RESPONSE. That's fine. AVOID THIS APP. Devs who don't respond do NOT deserve your support or money. Replaced this with GREAT APP, FREE, called simply, \"REMINDER,\" IT'S RECOMMENDED! This app has been DELETED.",
            "Great Application. The only problem is that in notification settings you can see all available sounds but it does not play it when you touch one just to see how it sounds. So you have to create a test alarm just to hear it. Unfortunately, as all such apps, it does not have an option to set a recurring alarm at the last day of each month. I bypassed this with setting a recurring alarm on the 1st day of each month with 24hrs advanced notification. Looks ugly but it works.",
            "i like it because you dont need your phone's volume turned on for the reminder to alert you. it seems to be working good for me. I also like the fact that you recently updated the app üëçüëçüëç However, i would like to see notification on phone screen to light up when reminder alarm goes off.?",
            "Volume of alarm is too low & there is no way to control it. If my phone is in my purse, I walk into another room away from it, or I'm asleep, I can't hear it. I missed taking meds, waking up on time, & an appointment. This ap is useless unless you fix this problem, which is disappointing, because I like the format otherwise. I also can't get it to repeat daily tasks like taking medication reminders. I set it to daily, yet it only shows up on one day."

Despite having a 'support' network in the form of an email address, it's rare to actually get a response from them, therefore questions and issues do not get solved. Emails are ignored. The android version of this app is extremely basic in comparison to the Apple version, and countless times I have had problems with not being able to sign in, or create a new account. None of my problems get resolved as my emails are ignored.",

I emailed support 3 times and eventually got 1 reply promising an update 'ASAP'... more than a month later and still waiting, I emailed a 4th time to recieve no reply. Funny to see I am not the only one with this problem looking at reviews here. Android version has less features than IOS too.",
            "For a app that has in app purchases their customer service and app is very poorly run. if you are a android user (like myself) trying to use this app let it be know you do not get anywhere near the same features as a ios user. I purchased the \"membership\" for $6 and nothing changed, literally not a thing. The support team doesn't email anybody back ever and now I've been completely locked out of the app, or at least the best parts of the app. I don't recommend at all."

            "Excellent app! Just what I needed. Smooth and attractive interface. Works perfectly without interruption: *Remember to Whitelist it in all battery saver and cleaning/clearing apps. Very good customer service; I highly recommend emailing developer with issues or questions. He is responsive and very helpful. I like it so much I bought the Pro version (Inexpensive at $2.99). Lots of additional features ‚Äî More than worth it!",
            "Finding this app very helpful for extended meditation practice of two to three hours. I set it at 20 minute intervals and adjusted the volume so that it makes a very subtle gong sound. I don't have to open my eyes as much to check the time :-)",
            "pretty good basic reminder app, simple to use and does what I want. Only one problem, I have it set up for daily reminders and sometimes it auto starts as it should and sometimes I have to open the app to get it to start for the day.",
            "Im enjoying it, but one big issue is when the reminder chimes, it turns the system volume up really high and hurts my ears if I am listening to something with earbuds in at the same time",
            "Lovely bell to remind me to breath and move if I haven't for a while. Brings my priorities to the front of the moment, what ever they might be!"

            "Loved the idea. Pill box mini arrived. Pretty cheap hardware. No matter, app experience might make things better. Crashes every time I try to add a location. The 'Misplace feature' was the USP for me as I always leave home in a rush. Without it you might as well use the pill packet and phone alarm. If this worked properly it could help people who struggle with memory but instead it's a nice idea executed without care charged at a premium. Disgrace",
            "Pretty upsetting just bought it was excited but the app just keeps crashing upon opening. Looks like they did not built the app to support Android 11. Waste the time and money.",
            "I just purchased this 08/20 and it's bricked. No updates in nearly a year. Will not work with Android 11 but they keep selling them. I now have a 40 tic-tac case. Fraud.",
            "Y'all really let me down in an area of my life I need help the most. With Android 11, the app no longer starts. Even before it would disconnect from my pill box causing me to forget to take medications. Taking medications on time and remembering you took them is SO important, considering health risks. It really doesn't seem like this company takes that into account. I had a normal amount of hopes and got very low returns. If you're looking into a pill box and app: look elsewhere. This ain't it.",
            "As with last year, does not work on Android 11. The beta is out, why does this app not test and update in advance?!"

            "This app is simple, easy to use, and an excellent way to remind you to eat small meals throughout the day. I love the \"awake\" function that lets you start your day when you actually wake up vs. a specific predetermined time. I love that you can adjust the intervals between meals, and it automatically times out the next meal based on when you click \"eat\" vs. a predetermined time. So helpful for real life that changes from minute to minute.",
            "I love this app. It really makes it easy to set your eating schedule. The only recommendation I would make is to allow for a medication reminder(s) as some need to occur at a specific time before or after eating and having all in one app would be ideal.",
            "This is exactly what I was looking for! I have a bad habit of not remembering to eat, but generic alarms don't work because my awake hours fluctuate so setting the same times everyday wasn't going to cut it. This app automatically adjusts the next meal based on the previous one, so I never have to worry about the hassle of resetting an alarm after every meal. I also appreciate that it isn't weight loss-specific because so many apps are like that and those stress me out. It's so easy to use, too!",
            "Super simple and easy to use. Also keeps track of my weight! Your day can start at any time and the other times automatically adjust!",
            "This has been a huge help to remind me when to eat! I would give it 5 stars if it had a quick button for 'eat' instead of just the push back eating for 15, 20, and 30 minutes. I would like to be able to look back at previous days. Would it be possible to enter a daily weight and have it show on a graph of some kind?"

            "It's just a great app for what I need.. Although... Unlike with my LGs I've owned in the past....With my new Motorola E 2020 cell... I had to use more options to get it to work correctly...like turing off battery saver on this app.. I like you can set a reminder for a year andor monthly just by choosing a prompt... On other similar apps... You have to scroll the calendar 1 year.. to get it to repeat that time frame.. Thanks for this app",
            "It is OK, but it doesn't have option to switch off and on the alarm, only delete or reschedule possible. If it's a recurring one, it automatically change to next time after passing the first occurrence. Despite having dismissed the alarm on due date it shows up next day and rings. Why?",
            "******UPDATE: In my last review I said how the app wasn't alarming off w/ the notifications. Then I read how another reviewer fixed the issue by changing the optimizations in the phone settings. I tried it & it works! Thank you God that I saw Roger's review!",
            "Three days or so after giving the App an excelent review, the app stopped working after an Android update. I have followed your instructions for the battery power management problem with negative results. Do you guys have specific instructions for a Note 10 Plus. Thank you",
            "Good App with no cloud sync or backup. When I lost my mobile I realise what I missed, it's not the aesthetic of app but the data I which I lost. This is 5 star app if it has cloud sync or at the least to backup the data over cloud. Hope developer will hear this out."

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

Widget has several options to customise :) -easy to use, customise cup size, daily goal.. can also have \"standard\" goals based on gender, weight, active lifestyle -achievements for motivation Suits me very well :) Would love integration to GoogleFit or MyFitnessPal :)",
            "Real simple and easy water tracker. Appreciate the ability to customize the water size and the widget is super useful to access from my home screen. The notification helpfully has the ability to add water from the pop up, but I wish it wouldn't open the app up automatically when you click it. It would make things easier if you could just add water from the notification when it comes up, then continue without interruption. but besides that, it's useful and practical.",
            "Good, helps and always reminds me to drink water. I do have a suggestion for the widgets though, can you make them add an amount of water to your daily goal without opening the app? The widgets are kind of just a display of your intakes but isn't really that functional. Also please make it able to write your water intake the previous days, because I just installed the app but it doesn't let me because I have not installed the app in those days yet.",

            "WASTE OF TIME. This is not a free app so don't waste your time with this app. It has a lot of bugs. I got it for the Medication list. The medication list has a lot of information to add that you don't need, and if you don't input the field you can't save it. You also have to add a doctor to each medication which adds a new doctor to your doctor list. So if you have 10 medications by the same doctor, you will have 10 doctors of the same name in your doctors list. If you delete the duplicate doctors you are also deleting the medication under that doctor's name.. I put a lot of work into adding my medications and then had to delete all the duplicate doctors, which deleted my medications. Plus, so many pop-up ads.",
            "This was a good app at the start. But like some other comments it keeps asking for doctors name.. I paid for the pro version and since then I haven't been able to access my reports. I had spent a lot of my time and effort to add and store this i information. And now I can't access it at all. I have refreshed the app but still no luck. ... Very Disappointed .",
            "This is a fantastic app!!! However, unfortunately the medication reminders rarely work. Under notification settings, it shows one a week to start, but where I have kept at it, during updating my medication it has finally allowed two a day!! Also there is no quick way of taking your medication from within the app. This could be such a great app if only this could be fixed. If it wasn't I wouldn't keep updating this every day!!",
            "This application has a lot of potential, however it needs more of an ability to interface and be customized. I bought the pro version and I'm going to have to stop using it. It's too complicated and I can put in the information that I need in a way that I can access it easily.",
            "The app deleted all my medical records when upgraded to paid version. the app keeps on crashing every time I enter a new medication but I thought it was bearable because no other app was able to record the meds the same way however when I decided to upgrade to get the Cloud sync feature once I upgraded and turned on Cloud sync it deleted all my medical history and I have to start again from zero. after that this application completely stopped working everytime I fire it up it will crash."

            "I take a medication for multiple reasons that are prelisted. Why can't I just select multiple options, rather than have to type in all out in \"other\"? Also, a place for that long prescription number you get from pharmacies to identify your prescription would be nice. It would really save a lot of time if you could automatically upload helpful information by scanning the bottle. What really caused me to give up on its usefulness though was it having no ability to input special instructions like \"take 3 tablets the first 3 days, 2 tablets the next 3 days...\" Not the worst app of sorts I've tried though. It would probably work really well with people with different needs.",

I love the set up of this app. The only thing I would say I dont like is I wish it had more pictures to choose from to put with my reminders.

            "I love this app, been searching for an app like this for a long time. The only drawback I see is under lab results, there is a note section upon entering result. I put the range the result was supposed to be in, but when you go back to that result, the note section is gone. It didn't make any sense to put it there. There is a special note section, but I didn't know I needed to put it in there to keep it. Also on medication list. Not a section on meds to show what it treats. I highly recommend .",
            "It's pretty good so far but a bit insufficient. You can use the app for multiple people and on the main page, you select the person you want. But then when you go into a category and choose an option to view (like appointments or meditations), you have to choose the person again. It gets annoying to choose the person each time you want to view something different even though that person is selected on the main page.",
            "The only drawback of this app is that you have to type everything in so be great if you update the app where you can upload or sync lab results and medical record with doctors that use My chart and similar health records.",
            "I use for personal use since I take a lot of medication and changes frequently but most doctor offices make you write all them down anyway. I suggest you keep a printed copy with you when you go",
            "Great having all this information with at all times. In case of emergency or even a doctor's appt., lab work, x-rays any type of procedure with or without a hospital stay, they all want to know what Meds u take, what Doc referred, what Pharmacy u use. Now I don't have to carry a notebook with all this info in it. Most people always have their phone them."

And I'm having trouble with the app. I've uninstalled and re-installed a few times and every time I log in it starts updating and it never goes past 91%. And I'm unable to use the drug feature which is super helpful in practice. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated.",
            "Being told I am required to update my app by November 6, but no update is available. Not sure what that is about and hope it still works after October 6, as I love the app and use it all the time.",
            "I've used this app for years, and now it won't work. It keeps saying update, and its updated on my phone....but won't work. Frustrating when I need a quick reference on prescribing meds.",
            "It was glitching since the last update. However, it's functioning properly now, after uninstalled and reinstalled it again!",
            "Always available with credible medication information. As a critical care nurse i need a tool like Epocrates on a daily basis, access is easy."

Can this option be included in the app settings?",

            "I would rate the concept a 5. I love that it is made in the USA and was willing to pay more to support their values- production must have cost a lot more. I like the quality of the unit and would recommend it for the above reasons. However, this is a review of the app. The app needs work. I'd like to see a more intuitive layout. I'm frustrated trying to navigate to where I can see the medicine name and indicate I took it. It just needs to be a succinct, 1 screen med list with TAKEN checkboxes",
            "This product is a real hit and miss. For the cost, I expect more. The notifications are a complete mess. I got 8 trivia questions at 308 am. My alarms are 6 am and 6 pm.",
            "I gave EllieGrid a 4 star because I use to forget to take my pills and sometimes I would take them and couldn't remember if I took them later in the day. It has helped because: - Alarms, dosages and days of the week are customizable - Latest update has auto Bluetooth connection when in range - EllieGrid alarms when it's time to take the medication - EllieGrid generates a report of when the pill box is opened for the that day and keeps history for the week. - The pill count feature notifies me when dosage count is low based on initial setup and dosage. Looks to be a week to 10 day alert. - Customer support response has been great. - How to videos are effective in covering features Why not a 5 star: -While it gives push notifications to my cell phone on some things, push notifications to my android for dosage due, dosage missed and low pill count would be beneficial when not with in ear shot of the pill box alarm. - Push notification for low battery level on the pill box would be a beneficial reminder to recharge EllieGrid. - The ability to select half dosages would allow tracking accurate usage so the low dosage warning would be accurate. - A customizable Bluetooth name would allow me to track both mine and my sons pill box as he requires my assistance Me and my son have been using EllieGrid for about 6 months and it has proven to be a valuable aide.",
            "Update 10/5/2020- I was able to get on and get it set up. Pros- It's a very cool concept and I've been using it for 3 days now. As someone who works 60+ hours a week I found it hard to remember to take my supplements throughout the day. I'd get busy and 3 hours would have passed. This helps me not only to take my supplements, but because I'm taking something at 4 intervals throughout the day it's also helping to drink more water and eat healthier which was part of my health journey.",
            "The box definitely helps me keep my husband regular on his medication, but the app doesn't register when the box is opened and has to be manually checked off within the app itself. I hope this issue gets fixed. Edit: I know how it's supposed to work. It does not do that. Lmao. So yes, I have to manually mark that the pill is taken every day, and that's a little bit of a bummer."

            "I just started using this app and I found the graphics very informative. I would suggest adding a menu to track menstrual cycle since thyroiditis can affect it and it would be great to have all info in one app. Also, it is confusing that the app close down whenever I press the \"back\" button, I think it would make more sense for it to redirect to the main menu. Last thing, top and bottom values of the bloodwork will very unlikely change over time so saving them would be great. Thanks",
            "Just set up the app and it looks like it is going to be very helpful...having everything in one place organized. The biggest change I would make would be the back arrow not bumping you out of the app. Something else that would be great would be a list of foods to eat whether you have hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Also, a place to keep track of what you eat would be great as well. Thank you :)",
            "Great app, simple and intuitive to use. No annoying ads. Seems like the team is about to release a major update - looking forward to seeing what the full version looks like!",
            "Cool graph is a tid confusing with other results in background. Graphs could be better. Otherwise. Good place to store info so I'm not having to go on mychart all the time.",
            "Very good app for tracking all the data, easy to use. I am looking forward to be downloading a new version that I hear is coming soon."

            "Super easy to use This app has fewer features than some of its rivals, but is far easier to use. It is simple and clear, doesn't require copious time spent on a questionnaire and simple clear information.",
            "Edit: Reverted back 4 stars, with issue fixed with reboot, great customer service. Fantastic app & love we can sync multiple devices with the paid option. Would be 5 stars if it also gave the option to track & remind for post-partum medications, ie this pain relief every 4-6 hours, that one every 8 hours and the other ones daily. To be able to manually add the name of the medication & the frequency of doses would be awesome with alerts to tell you when to take them",
            "I'm really happy with this app. It helps my baby brain to keep tracks of feeds and nappies, as well as their contents. I find all the statistics and analysis very helpful. Highly recommend it to the new parents.",
            "Final update: I have raised the stars from 3 to 5 for the great customer support: very responsive and helpful. üôÇ *** I really liked the app, its functionality, how easy it is to use it. But after I paid the fee the adverts didn't disappear plus they pop up in the night and Maggie noise while my little one is sleeping closer to me. Dissapointing. I would be grateful if either the advert will be removed or my money back. Upd: I have sent an email to the developer. Waiting for an answer.",
            "I have only used the free trial so far, but think I will need to purchase. Being on the special care baby unit the days blur even more than at home and I was losing track of expressing and breastfeeding once we got started. I love how easily this app records everything and I can go back and double check."

Only thing I wish for dev to improve or implement is the ability to change font colour in widgets. If you use dark mode the text on widget is not easy to read EDIT: after testing it for over a week I see that location based reminders no longer work and it doesn't sync with my tablet anymore even though I paid for the app. These two functions were very important to me. Disappointed.",
            "It's ok. I usually have my phone on silent. The app reminds me on time but makes no sounds so unless I'm looking at my phone anyways I miss the alert. I've had reminder apps that still make noise when your ringer is off so this one isn't great",

            "This app is okay. Definitely not great if you're looking for something similar to the iPhone reminders and its full of bugs, but the most annoying part for me are the disgusting 'jokes' that keep popping up in place of ads! Horribly sexist boomer humour. Please get rid of them.",

I noticed a few issues with the app along the years so I reached out the developer clearly explaining the scenarios. He/she took my feedback, understood the issue, and fixed it. That to me is the ideal customer care! Things that could be improved: 1) give more options of selecting ring tones for alarms 2) the interface could look better",
            "Very good App. Quick alarm is an innovative idea which is very useful. Have used the App for over a week, works well as planned. One of the few alarms which actually gives a ring (other Apps just message). Very useful. Your initial set up needs to be made more user friendly with correct guidelines. Very happy.",

What is triggering it to go off if not the time? Unfortunate every similar app seems to have the same complaints. You guys are all doing it wrong, figure it out!",

Why. when you open the app does it have to open on a set new reminder page? When I open a reminder app I expect to see a list of my current reminders, not this totally unneeded and unnecessary option (there's the \"+\" button for this!!). So instead of a solid 4+ it gets a 3, and only for the reasons above I will not be buying the Pro version.",

If reminder is set to the \"envelope icon\" the entry jumps at the set time into the smartphone notification bar. Completed entries show up in the completed window and can be either deleted or retrieved/or changed + pushed back in the reminder window. I absolutely love the widget window with the scrolling function in order to check entries.Will keep!!!",

            "This KP app is extremely helpful & I rely on it for staying updated on my meds. Other help too.",
            "Limited. Hit & Miss Reminders work sometimes. Don't rely on this. Reminders are only on half hours. Very limiting. If you have any other \"reminders\" at the same time the app doesn't work. So my alarms and music cancel it. Often when it does work it's 10-20 minutes late. Great if it's your secondary but not so great if it's a primary. Remember it's set for half hours ... Yep tends to go off close to the quarter hour.",
            "Bugs everywhere! The reminder notification never works (3 different phones now and MANY different app updates). The refill function, is iffy at best, and they keep changing it anyway. There used to be a feature that if you took your medication a little early, you could go into the schedule and mark the next event as \"Taken Early\". No more- they removed it in an update. The only good thing about the app is that it does reliably sync with doctor's current prescriptions and instructions for you."

            "sweet and prices are spot on. so may options to assist users. I have saved a lot of $$$ using this app. I paid 35.00 to join a grocery chain store and saved a little. It paid for itself. This FREE site has saved me a whole lot more without any cost to join. Not one issue using this app. I especially like the listing of Pharmacies in the order of cheapest to most expensive. Sweet app, it continues to get better and prices on drugs lower. I just can't figure how they can do this at no cost to us..",
            "Good Rx has saved me so much money this year. I love it. The one difficulty I have is a couple of my mess are different quantity as what is offer. Also can't figure out how to add my membership number that I have got the premium service. Other then that its Great.",
            "This app will truly save money üí∞ if you don't have insurance. And in lots of cases with generic products, it will save you money even with insurance. I see it everyday since I work in a pharmacy that accepts GoodRx. Best advice, don't use the free cards from Dr offices. Download the app and look up each rx. You'll get the best price if you search for them separately. Write down the coupon codes (4 separate numbers) for each one before going to the pharmacy to pick up.",
            "Absolutely essential app for anyone that takes medication. There's nothing inherently amazing about the app itself, it functions just fine. But I'm not exaggerating when I say that I would likely not be alive today without the insane discounts I get from GoodRX. Not much of an app reviewer, but figured I'd drop a 5 star just as a thank you.",
            "I use this for most prescriptions now and for the last couple years. Never had an issue. Most beneficial savings have been from paying $150 for my dog monthy for one of her prescriptions (did that for a year before finding goodrx in 2018), now down to about $65-$70 monthly! Love this app! It has saved me at least several thousand dollars over 2 years. This is lifesaver for most people. Most people aren't rich and this has helped us continue our own medical care along with the precious furbabies!"

            "Well its been a little over 36 hours and I don't enjoy this app. The first 16 hours it was great! Reminded me to drink every 2 hours. I've been awake since 07:00, and not once have I been reminded to drink. So I'm deleting this and will find a hopefully better app to remind me. I lead a super busy life and the reminders are so welcomed and I was beyond excited at first that this app delivered said reminders. Sad it didn't work out.",
            "Really good app it reminds me to drink as I tend not to drink a lot during the day ,its made me realised that yes I do need to ,dry skin headaches and also you can get water infection by not drinking enough , so I use the alarm on here ,which you can set yourself as to when you need to drink fluid. So yes good app",
            "So downloaded the app to track what I drink and different sorts. However after 1 day I've noticed that the main page doesn't tally the quantity properly. Ive been drinking in rounded amounts 250 or 500ml but its telling me I have drank 2253ml out of 2500ml, however I've actually drank 3000ml (4x250ml and 4x500ml). Yet the graph is correct. Think this needs to be addressed. However i do like that i can log different drinks",

            "This app is just what I needed. Due to medical issues, sometimes I don't feel thirsty even when I'm having other symptoms of dehydration, but this app will help me to drink enough fluids throughout the day."

            "It really works. It keeps me constant and I don't fall off of drinking my 8 cups of water a day. My skin has also started clearing up on my face and I have a much better immune system now. Lots of pros if you buy this app. I haven't had any issues that needed resolving. I would recommend!üòÅ",
            "Excellent app, does exactly what it's set out to do and does wonders for your water drinking habits. I had to remove 1 star however, as it doesn't have any vibration notification options and sometimes presents a delay when you record a drink. Ps. There's a small grammatical error in the main menu ('you've stay hydrated).",
            "This app it a really good reminder of I must take my water in 500ml that's what I chose even when I wake up, I think of taking my water I love it's reminder that I must drink water . It's really nice I cannot delete this app. It has made me kept me motivated all time long .",
            "Nice app, would rather have a push notification at tge right time rather than a constant message on the notification bar, as if I don't check my phone I might miss it. Also, if I reach the goal I do not want to see notification anymore, while even when selecting that option, I do. But overall, good to use."

            "Terrible. I'm a brand spanking new user, and this app is FAR from user friendly. I can't even log a seizure from 10 years ago because I have to back track one day at a time despite have a month option listed. I'm not taking any medications for this yet either, but this app keeps harassing me to list mine. I'm going to visit a doctor soon for this condition, but I wanted to have a log ready using this app. Apparently, it's not easy.",

I highly recommend for anyone having seizures. My only wish for the app would a list view of your seizures to make it easier to show your doctor.",

        "description": "\"Event Reminder\" is a simple generic todo reminder app with a calendar where you can easily create reminder / alarm / todo of events planned by touching few buttons. It supports voice so you don't need to write event title. You can create \"one time event\" or \"repeating events\". While choosing repeating events, you can set frequency to repeat, for example, \"every 2 days until 6 weeks\" or \"every weekends until 2 months\" etc.\r\n\r\nAt home page you see a list of next set of due events with its priorities on the left to identify importance clearly. You swipe back to see expired and finished events. You swipe ahead to see next set of upcoming events. You can open calendar to see all your events for that month, depicted as status/priority color codes boxes. You can see events statistics with bar and pie graphs to monitor your progress effectively.

            "Update August 2017: Doesn't work on Google Pixel. I'm very disappointed. And I couldn't move my data from a Samsung to the pixel.  (On Samsung Galaxy S5) This app does what it says and gives you reliable reminders. It would be much better if I could email/export a history or sync with a website version.",
            "This is a great app to have because it's easy to view your prescriptions. I would recommend my family and friends to get this app. Thank you for creating this app.",
            "Does not work on Huawei GT3, missing some of the reminders.",
            "I can't edit the Rx, nor use any button on that page.",
            "It took me a sec to figure out that it does log the time the med was actually taken and it also took me a sec to figure out you can go back and put in the time for missed doses on the app. Weren't around the phone when the alarm went off but you know you took your meds. Very nice app well worth getting the pro version. The widget is a big plus. Really, really nice. This is the best I've seen so far. This app will definitely make sure you take your meds."

I'd rather go back to pen and paper than to report to Google the what, when, why, who, which and how of my medical history.",

            "This app has great potential and I have received quick response and refund from developer. However alarms and syncing do not work, and it takes too long to slide through the list of dates when app is opened on the Galaxy S8 Plus. I also think ‚Ç¨12 a year is to pricey for just syncing capabilities. Perhaps developer should concentrate on developing the app to it potential, as it feels like it is in beta and then charge a one time upgrade fee. Would love to have been able to use this app though."

So I've had to uninstall it and go back to another Voice Reminder app that I used previous to this one. Update: Whatever the issue causing the problem has been fixed and now the app works again without failing. I primarily use it to remind me to take my medications at specific times each day so it is of utmost necessity to have this program perform on time.",
            "It works consistently. Only drawback is it will announce even if you are in a call. Could be embarrassing if you are using it for self improvement lol. But it's also funny if you're with friends and your phone suddenly starts talking",
            "I really like the app, but I just uninstalled it for the second time and won't be reinstalling because it works fine then all of the sudden will no longer work, keeps crashing matter what I do I can no longer open it Happened twice. Not going to try again. Because it is annoying to have to rerecord personal reminders. Edit: going to give it a try again, hoping it doesn't stop working again.",

Just curious if I missed the update or how I fix these annoying ads Annoyed..... I've used this app for years because of the ease and simpleness. Now I keep getting pop up ads while trying to set up reminders who wouldn't that annoy.. ???? From the other reviews it sounds like it's not just me? Let's go developer.. fix it or I think our time here is done.",
            "I've used this app for a long, long time but decided to try a different one when I bought a new phone recently. The (obnoxious pop-up) ads have increased over the last year and they rudely interrupt me while trying to add or check a reminder. I was going to bite the bullet and just buy the app but it looks like they only take donations. Yuck, donate and still get ads? Sucks, because I love this app so much but just can't tolerate the ads anymore.",
            "I really like this app but what I don't like are the recent changes to the way advertisements work. I can deal with them on the screen but I do not like when they pop up as I go to type The reminder information. It would be most appreciative if The folks at Life reminders would change this. Thank you",
            "I like this app and it does everything I need, however the ads popping up before you type sometimes I have to close it and re open in airplane mode to get rid of the ads. Please offer a paid version with no ads!! Unbelievably annoying!!",
            "I have been using this app for about a month, I really like it's features and it does just about everything I want, except...... it doesn't always work. I need multiple audible reminders each day and every couple of days the reminder either vibrates but no sound, or nothing at all. Very frustrating, I've looked at lots of app's and this one suits me best but looks like I will have to keep looking. If you really need a reliable reminder I suggest you keep looking."

I wanted 10pm... it was 6:42 pm... so it would put 10:42 or 6pm.... then the options for scheduling the meds is to limited 4x day? prn? fix more bugs plz",

I tried to use their Help Section & found it only contains a description of what some, not all, of their available Tools do & it doesn't have any support for problems using them, which isn't helpful at all.

Ive been using this app for over a year now and its helped me keep on track with bills, appointments, phone calls, ect. I even set it to remind me to take my weekly medication. The simplicity of it is why i love it. Thank you for making this app.",
            "This app does exactly what I needed it to do. I can set quick reminders for all those little things that normally would slipped my mind during the day. If I'm busy when the alarm goes off I can click on postpone and the alarm will remind me at a preset length of time of my choosing. It also keeps a log of your completed reminders which can be reset and used again. Very good at what it does, and it does what I need.",
            "It's a very good app, I looove it so much, it remindes us often its the best reminder to do your chores and your lists, I recommend u to install this I really love it, thanks to the developer and I am happy that u updated it recently and also can u add more new features in it, so, it's going to be impressive.. but anyways thanks for reading my review"

            "I love this app! I use this for my grocery list and many other lists. I love the way you can list your tasks and subtasks. I really like that you and easily rearrange the list. I also like how you can set yourself a reminder notification. I inadvertently changed a setting so I contacted the creator and got an answer right away! I am very satisfied!",
            "Does what it says on the tin, however it seems repeating tasks don't actually repeat. Once you check them off they move to the deleted section and don't reappear in the calendar. If I'm missing something I will change my rating but I have looked through the options and checked the duplicate tasks option but the problem persists. Edit: after tinkering around I've found recurring tasks can be kept in the list but unless they duplicate they don't repeat and even duplicates complete themselves",
            "Edit: changed to 5 stars after contacting the developer I realised that there were so many more options to customise the app to display & function to suit me, I expected the system settings to only have a few basic options but there's masses of customisable settings which make the app even more helpful & brilliant to use. Highly recommend this app! Great app, simple & efficient. The subtasks feature really helps me feel I've achieved something when I can tick off a small part of a bigger job.",
            "Love this app so much, I love that you can add subpoints under each task and the widgets are a great addition too. I live my life by lists and this makes it so much easier having them all on my phone.",
            "So far so good. Easy to use. Didn't know that I would like the sort by color approach, may have to try this in my physical files as well. Yes, I have files ;-)"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "I've been using this app for quite a while and have found it to be simple and effective with minimal adverts, but now it's pushing out full page animated noisy ads that you can't mute or delete for 5(?) or so seconds. Appalling, deleting, shame",
            "Unlike other more sophisticated reminder apps that I gave 1 star, your notification sound selection button actually took us to the device's notification sound selection page and not to vibrate page or 'Do not disturb' page. Since you meet my need, take your 5 stars. Hehe..",
            "It is great app but i have done setting that reminder message pop up with vibrate and sound, but its is not coming liks that. Its coming like notifications. Otherwise it is amaizing app. Help me with these problems.",
            "Reminder by shadow , this is quite good in performance , other similar apps are usually inferior to this , although there is still quite a big room for improvement but keep it robust or make it even more robust , so that it does not crashes at times & keep on reminding without any lapse , although at this moment its beauty is that it is small on disc space has a simplistic UI and out performs similar apps .",
            "One of the best reminder app I came accross. Very easy to add, very simple to use. The Best part is that it keeps the stamp on screen unless we reschedule or dismiss. One only draw back (Perhaps developer can take care in new revision is) you can not sync with other device. Best of luck."
