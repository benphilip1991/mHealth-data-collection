I first started using it after I had started a new med and had some bad interactions. Even my doctor hadn't warned me about them. I was able to request a med change and get it resolved. It's also helped me avoid several over the counter meds that I wouldn't have known not to take otherwise. There are a lot of other features, but that's the main one I use.",
            "I really was impressed with this app and all it offered. Until I spent over an hour inputting all my drugs, then got a message that the app had an update and I needed to update it, turn it off, then re-open. Upon doing so, all the descriptive info, like dosages, etc. were gone. The next day at my MD visit, I was unable to pull up a simple list of my drugs. When I put in a drug name, nothing I'd put in was available. So I'd wasted all my time entering everything. Won't do it again! Delete!",
            "Very informative,but couldn't put all of my medications in. The app didn't allow past a certain number.",
            "This app has an extensive list of available medications and medical conditions. Having the ability to list personal medications is very helpful, especially if you have 2 or more. It is great for checking medication and food interactions, as well as looking at side effects of each medication.",
            "My mother is a nurse and she uses this app so I thought I'd give it a try. I am a dietetic intern and this app has really been very informative in my rotations. I bought the premium subscription because the ad placement made the app difficult to use, but the ad free upgrade for a year is really affordable. Thank you for this app!"

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "This app is a real life saver! It is simple and intuitive, it has all the features you actually need and doesn't overwhelm you with all the useless fancy features other similar apps are packed with. The overdose warning is the big bonus of this app. As for the support service, they really answer within 24h and actually listen to you. This is rare enough to give 5 stars.",
            "I have uninstalled since the last notification should have been at 10pm and the app is just trigerring an alarm every 4 hours throughout the night outside of the schedule. This is a joke of an app. Stay away from this app if you don't want to have false alarms ringing through the night.",
            "I am/was a software designer. The interface is simple and pleasant. Easy to add and schedule meds. I like being able to create different versions of myself so I can do slightly different sets if meds for different days. Good program. I would pay a onetime fee to remove adds.",
            "Excellent basic functionality. I just wanted a basic app to remind me about a medication taken once daily. I can't speak to more advanced functions, but works great as a basic reminder app.",
            "The app is helpful, but it should have an option, once you set all your medications for a certain time, to just choose all at one time and be done. It's annoying to be doing it one by one. It's ok, but not what I expected!"

            "I used this app on both my previous and current phone, I don't get reminders anymore and it was the thing that kept me on track. I had to set up an alarm \"reminder\" and right now all I can use the app as is a visual on if I missed doses (if I don't forget to tick any days off). I could use my default calendar in the same manner. Edit: I googled the issue and tried different solutions, it worked for a bit but I have to constantly fix it every few days/weeks because it randomly stops working again",
            "Does the job well. I like the fact that it if you don't mark the medication as \"Taken\" or \"Missed\", the app will keep reminding you every 30 minutes after the due time. Sometimes I am unable to take my pills immediately and this feature is great for a procrastinator like myself.",
            "It's a very good app and help me a lot to remember when I need to take the pills!! But I think that the app can be more easily to se when I take and don't take the pills, maybe a grafic.",
            "Wish it had a little bit of a better visual for seeing which pills you've taken and which you haven't for the day (maybe a graphic that actually looks like a pill box?) but overall the best app I've used for managing medications.",
            "Monthly subscription? Really? Edit: I did not misunderstood anything. This is scummy behavior. Your app does not warrant a monthly subscription. Just to get rid of the intrusive ads you need to subscribe. Give your users an option to one time pay to get rid of the ads and keep your monthly subscription separate. I uninstalled the app."

            "I was excited when I saw all the options.... but then I tried the symptom checker and it wouldnt bring up the possible issues to choose from... ok fine I know what's wrong with me, so I try to add my meds for the reminder. it insisted on either only changing the hour and making the scheduled minute part for what ever time it is now.. I wanted 10pm... it was 6:42 pm... so it would put 10:42 or 6pm.... then the options for scheduling the meds is to limited 4x day? prn? fix more bugs plz",

Then, this app was unable to define the medication even with just putting the name in the search bar! Totally useless app. After all of that i tried a common over the counter pill to just to see if i could get a result, and it said my internet connection was down!",
            "I tried several of their available Tools to use & most of them don't work. I tried to search for a couple very common drug & they couldn't locate them. Their Symptom Checking Tools drop down selection wouldn't work. The only Tools that I could use was the BMI Calculator & Blood Sugar Calculator. I tried to use their Help Section & found it only contains a description of what some, not all, of their available Tools do & it doesn't have any support for problems using them, which isn't helpful at all. This is an extremely poor App!!",

For the last few weeks the reminders no longer appear, I tried to contact the developer via Google Play but I haven't had a response. I need an app that will work and provide what it advertises so unfortunately I am going to be deleting this and looking for a different more reliable app.",
            "Really helpful app. I'm recovering from an operation and have a minefield of pills to take and this is so helpful! Only annoyance is things like having to use a scrolling clock to record when you took the meds... Would be much better if I could click and enter the time!",
            "The app is set to remind me to change patches every 72 hours. It doesn't work. I don't complain when a free app doesn't work, but I paid for this one and I expect it to work. I would also appreciate it if you would m ake some kind of audible notification in stead of email. Thank you, Karen Despres",

            "I really like the app except for one thing. The circle on the dashboard and the entered meds do not work like that of a face of a clock. If I have to select skip to quiet the alarm, and then go back, what I would think is 4pm as that on a clock, it isn't.",
            "Great Reminder Tool! Pings at the reminder time you set & unless you ☑️ to say you've taken it it reminds you again everytime you open your phone. As someone else has said a snooze function on the reminders would be a good addition.",
            "Very easy to use and input new medications and just as easy to remove old medications. The timer goes off when it should and reminds me. Gives me the option to say I have or have not taken that specific dose and keeps track of it. 100% recommend.",
            "App is really good and helpful, 2 things for improvement 1.There should be a backup of data option where I can save over google drive 2.Upon taking medication post alarm is not as user friendly as at the time of alarm..."

            "I have have used the free version for a few days . It works well - user-friendly and clear. It needs careful setting up, like any  app which handles your individual personal information.  I take up to a dozen medications in over 25 doses a day, so the easy to read but no fuss presentation of th is app is just what  I needed.  I have moved on to the premium version and I'm pleased with that too.",
            "I have quite a few mental health issues and have a very hard time remembering things. My phone is for the most part my memory. The app works fine for a while. Now half the time neither reminder goes off. I've missed doses. With the medication I take missing doses is dangerous. I'm having to uninstall and look for another reminder app. Turned battery optimization off battery saver not even on. Problem still there. Odd my new 1 works perfectly. You are to pushy. I will not use your app.",
            "It's almost a great app. I am disappointed that it isn't user-forgiving. When you get an alarm and take your med(s), but forget to select the medication to indicate taken, you cannot go back later and indicate you took it at the correct time. What it does is shift the schedule of that med from the time you selected, thus delaying your next dose. Update: The creator responded with an unobvious, multi-stepped way of resetting the time of taken medicine to prevent the schedule adjust process. 4*",
            "P.i.t a. The keyboard gets in the way ! EDIT* using system back button on my phone worked, (durr) Thank you! EDIT**This app is really growing on me. I love that you can snooze! Also, ads are strategically placed between times. Helpful ☺️ Q; I needed to change time on the reminder/taken screen. *Fixed Please add basic editing for the pics we take. Crop/brighten. Or, adding text to the default pics would be handy.(150mg). Especially if the person takes the same meds in different doses(75mg)Thx!",
            "reducing 2 stars coz its no longer giving reminder notifications....Track option is missing calander dates.... like 23rd to straight 30th & these are days with no notifications...& if no notifications i didnt bother to click Take button... in actual due to app not reminding.. i m getting delayed to take or sometimes missing my meds.. please fix..."

The pictures provided are well colored and can be zoomed.\r\n\r\nContents of this app:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction To Dermatology : Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body.\r\n\r\n2.  History Taking\r\n\r\n3. Acne Vulgaris : Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Alopecia Areata : Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.\r\n\r\n5. Bacterial Infections : The most common are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (also known as MRSA) is now the most common pathogen causing skin infections in the United States.\r\n\r\n6. Drug Eruptions : In medicine, a drug eruption is an adverse drug reaction of the skin.\r\n\r\n7. Eczema : Eczema is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. The word \"eczema\" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.\r\n\r\n8. Fungal Infections : Yeast infections of the skin are called cutaneous candidiasis and are caused by yeast-like fungi called candida.\r\n\r\n9. Leprosy : Leprosy is a chronic, progressive bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\r\n\r\n10. Lichen Planus : Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is an inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, often itchy, flat-topped bumps, developing over several weeks.\r\n\r\n11. Lupus Erythematosus : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.\r\n\r\n12. Parasitic Infections : Parasitic Infections of the Skin.\r\n\r\n13. Pityriasis Rosea : Pityriasis rosea: This common skin disease causes patches on the skin. Pityriasis rosea (pit-uh-rahy-uh-sis row-zee-ah) is a common skin disease that causes a rash.\r\n\r\n14. Psoriasis : Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful.\r\n\r\n15. Urticaria : Urticaria, also known as hives, is an outbreak of swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly -- either as a result of the body's reaction to certain allergens, or for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n16. Viral Infections : Localised skin conditions caused by viral infections include: Herpes simplex (cold sores and genital herpes), eczema herpeticum. Herpes zoster (shingles), including Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Herpangina / vesicular stomatitis (oral ulcers)\r\n\r\n17. Vitiligo : Vitiligo is a disease in which the pigment cells of the skin, melanocytes, are destroyed in certain areas. Symptoms and signs of vitiligo include loss of skin color in the form of depigmented, or white, patches of skin in any location on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can find the following apps in our catalog as well:\r\n\r\nAll Skin Diseases Atlas and Treatments\r\nBreath Sounds\r\nHeart Sounds\r\nCardiopulmonary Sounds\r\nClinical Dermatology\r\nDermatology Atlas\r\nHeart Sounds Collection\r\nInternal medicine mnemonics\r\nclinical medicine mnemonics\r\nemergency medicine mnemonics\r\ncardiology mnemonics\r\nobstetrics and gynecology mnemonics\r\nNeurology mnemonics\r\nHuman Anatomy Mnemonics\r\nCancers and genital health\r\n10 foods that lowers cholesterol\r\nHeart sound\r\nbest foods for flat belly\r\ncancer fighting foods\r\nRemedy to menstrual pain\r\nhealth benefit of honey\r\n\r\nIf you like this app, please share it with other doctors.

I would gladly pay a subscription to avoid the ads, but instead it appears I will not be using this app and will be searching for something better.",
            "What I felt is that for all drugs a doctor cannot remember its adverse effects and interactions with other drugs. This is a good base to help know interactions before prescribing any new drug. I recommend to use it. And I recommend the developers to include newer drugs also.",
            "Fantastic app. Provides valuable information on diseases and medical conditions. Would be very valuable to someone currently in or planning on going into the health field as well as provide useful information and tools for the average person.",

            "I purchased the premium version of this App, as a 17+ yr seasoned RN, comparing this app to the free version of Epocrates- I'm very disappointed. I tried to write a detailed review, but there wasn't enough space. This app is difficult to chk specific drug interactions, has minimal reported adverse events, and is not as thorough in the meds mechanism of action. I sent an email through the App to ask for a refund, in detail stating the reasons why (twice). I never heard back.",
            "What cought my attention in this App is the Diagnostic Test Effect (DTE). Although not all drug contained here has DTE, however i appreciate the developers of this App. As a Medical Laboratory Scientist this App has helped me a great deal on how to advice and prepare my patient prior to when test will be conducted so that we won't arrive at false result of any kind. Although i still do some research on what i get from the App before applying it but still this App is awesome",
            "If you are in Canada, this book does NOT have the Canadian specific formulary. Also, does not allow copying text and the worse part; does not allow you to search in the page. Install it and within 1-3 days it will offer you 50% off buying the full license. But honestly, it's not worth it. 2 stars because it has an offline mode.",
            "I downloaded the free version to see if I wanted to purchase the premium. However, all of the screens are blank. I attempted to send a message to customer support, but it will not allow me since I did not buy the premium version. Now I will definitely not buy the premium version since you have to pay to ask a question. Ridiculous.",

            "This is the absolute BEST pill reminder out there and it was just made better when the last update provided the ability to move the app and the data to an SD card, freeing up memory on the phone. It still runs just as fast. Since I wrote the above I have had to replace my Samsung Android phone with a new S-20 which apparently doesn't allow moving the app to an SD card. Also I'm wishing there was a way to enter a MWF pill routine.",
            "This has been a wonderful app that helps remind me to take medicine. The continuous reminders and reminders that show up on the lock screen are essential to prevent missed dose, especially if I'm away from my phone for any reason.",
            "I've been using Dosecast for years, since I had it on my Kindle back in the day. I take a lot of meds at staggered times of day, so reminders are essential. Dosecast, even the free version, does an easy and amazing job of that.",
            "I have many medical issues, one being a stroke that affected my memory. I forget things, sometimes right after I do them. This app reminds me to take my meds including Insulin and 5 minutes later when I wonder if I took my Insulin I can check this app and see that I did. I also use this app when I go to the doctor or ER to show the staff all my meds, the strength, the dose, when they are scheduled and when I took them. This app is a life saver for me, literally. Great job Dosecast!!!!",
            "This is usually a great app, but I'm not getting reminder notifications lately. I only get reminders when I open the app to check it, then I'll get all the reminders for the previous day. This seems to have started after the most recent update. Happy to give more stars if this new bug gets fixed."

I have been using this app for over a year now and will go to it for almost anything from an ear ache to muscle cramps, infections, stomach aches, the flu, head colds, you name it and this book with have the natural cure for it.",
            "Careful, reviews here were bought. Check other apps of phytotherapy and you'll find the exact same words. That aside, I still don't suggest this app, nor for beginners or professionals. For beginners there're way too many technical terms just to fill in the page. For professionals we know there'rre A LOT of danger with what they're mentioning regarding the method on how to use the plant. Cut the leaf and ingest it? What part of the leaf? How many? Unless you know what you're doing, don't risk it",
            "I have had this app several months now, I check with this app whenever some new illness or health issue arises. This app should be in every phone because doctors won't tell you \" fix yourself \" , with common products found in many homes , to solve your problem . After all they are in the pill prescription business",
            "Having studied herbalism and alternative medicine for decades I expected something more from this app. The list of herbs, while lengthy, omits a number of extremely important and useful herbs while including some that I have never heard of. Some of the recommendations are more like old folk cures and again, omit proven useful herbal remedies. I would not rely on this app for anything.",
            "I gave it 5 starts because it really is a rather comprehensive beginning herbal app. If you know nothing you will come away knowing enough to get you started. It also very well organized, which definitely supports learning. If you know most of this it is a great reference for common ailments and herbs."

Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric patients, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\r\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life. While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \r\n\r\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\r\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  You also have access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient. Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\r\n\r\nCASE DESIGN \r\nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents.  He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \r\n\r\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \r\nTwitter: @MinervaMedSim\r\nWeb: https://full-code.com",

            "The front cover of my Nursing Drug Handbook 2021 says \"get the app for weekly updates\", so I downloaded it. The free version does NOTHING! It *should* say BUY the app, yet I bought the book! Why doesn't buying the book give me access to the app?! Also, you can't search for a partial name - if it isn't the full name, it will say there's no matching results. 🙄🤦‍♂️",
            "If I could give it no stars, I would. I bought the paper copy. The actual book costs the same, and it advertised the app for weekly updates, but they essentially want me to buy a whole new book. There are many other apps out there that do the same thing for FREE. Save your money and get the print copy, this app is utter garbage",
            "I love the information once I find the medication I am looking for. When I first got the app, there was a scroll tab at the right to go quickly down the alphabet. Now I have to rapidly fly through every medication title to get where I am going. It is annoying, but worth it in the end. Search never works for me either. I have a Samsung S7 that still works-too stubborn/cheap to upgrade!",
            "This app may be good, but it doesn't work for me. I bought the paid version to have as a resource in clinical. Everytime I open it, it asks me to update the data base. When I do this it goes into an endless loading screen that nevers finishes. If I exit out and come back in it asks me to update again.",
            "This has been a great resource for me. The information about the drugs is the most up to date I can find and the patient considerations are extremely helpful and valuable. Able to look up any medication quickly and look for side effects to be aware of."

            "Makes such an important difference going to the Dr when you can say exactly when something started and you can report symptoms you forgot about. Unfortunately • I can't load a photo in the profile (\"Unable to load photo\" error message). • I'd love a search feature so I can tell the Dr when a particular event last happened. • It would be nice to also be able to change symptom icons too. Fix these 3 things and I'll rate a well deserved 5/5.",
            "This app is exactly what I needed! I've been using a notebook to record all the symtoms, medication, doctor visit, etc. in the past two years. I no longer need to write them anymore. Love the electronic recording app! Thank you developers for this great app! I highly recommended!!",
            "You can't add notes without upgrading, which is kind of a basic feature. I want to simply mark if they are healthy or sick for the day. If they are sick then second level would be something like \"has a sore throat\", or fever. I don't want to look through a list of 50 illness to find fever. It just didn't work for me.",
            "I'm using Medicalog to keep track of my kids' conditions and Medications, especially when treating them at home and they are all sick. Con- the entries come under a date, but without a time stamp. I have to add the times of the medication given manually as a note.",
            "Does not work! I upgraded to full version in order to get full benefit of the app. Will not let me add any medications. Have to scroll through a huge list of obscure diseases just to get to something simple like fever."

I would say that about one-third of the time when I search for a condition or anasic keyword that obviously should get results, I get no results at all. So it would appear that the app does not have access to all of the content found on the Web MD website. To me, this means there is really no point in using the app.",

            "Helpful but needs user friendly tweaking. It's complicated to find out how to alter the look of the meds. You have to go under settings separately from that. There needs to be a way to add notes daily for each profile in case something is off about your meds, reaction, pet, ect. Perhaps as premium content. I subscribed but this is a needed feature that I don't want separate app to track notes for conditions of an illness ect. Setting up med lengths needs work. Difficult to understand",
            "Your app is giving me remainder of medicine after 20 min. That's kind of timelapse can produce serious complications for kidney patients. Do something about it. Even after using this I have to maintain a extra offline chart. That's a complete waste of app.",
            "Great simple app. Works as advertised. Just using it to keep track of AM PM pills",
            "It alarms me on time and accurately tells how many pills are left. However, customer support never responded to the several emails I sent, so I can't tell if the app has a feature to remind me to refill my medication before it runs out. That's really annoying. Why even put a feedback option in the app if they don't reply to it?",
            "This is an excellent app that is ruined by a poor design choice.  For some reason, the schedule is set in this order \"Night, Morning, Afternoon, Evening\"  instead of in chronological order \"Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night\".  There's no way to change it and you can't trick it by setting Night at 8am followed by Morning at 12pm.  It won't allow you to use an AM time for Night or a PM time for Morning.  So every time you open the app to see what medications you need to take, your night time medications are shown instead of the current medications you need to take.  I can't count how many times I've checked off my medications as I took them and then had to go back and \"untake\" my Night meds and scroll down the list to get to the meds I was supposed to be taking.  This could end up being a dangerous situation depending on what you're taking.   Except for that issue, I like pretty much everything about the app.  The notifications show which meds you need to take and the amount.  The app has a dark theme option.  And I like that when you click on the notification, it takes you to the app and you can check off each medication as you take it instead of just a \"take all\" option."

        "description": "In Islam, Prophetic medicine (Arabic: الطب النبوي‎, 'Al-Tibb al-nabawī) is the advice given by the prophet Muhammad with regards to sickness, treatment and hygiene as found in the hadith, and the writings undertaken primarily by non-physician scholars to collect and explicate these traditions. It is distinct from Islamic medicine, which is a broader category encompassing a variety of medical practices rooted in Greek natural philosophy. Prophetic medical traditions exhort humans to not simply stop at following Muhammad's teachings, but encourage them to search for cures as well. The literature of prophetic medicine thus occupies a symbolic role in the elucidation of Islamic identity as constituted by a particular set of relationships to science, medicine, technology and nature. There has historically been a tension in the understanding of the medical narratives: are they of the same nature as Muhammad’s religious pronouncements, or are they time-sensitive, culturally situated, and thus not representative of a set of eternal medical truths? [2] This body of knowledge was fully articulated only in the 14th century, at which point it was concerned with reconciling Sunnah (traditions) with the foundations of the Galenic humoral theory that was prevalent at the time in the medical institutions of the Islamicate world.[3] It is nonetheless a tradition with continued modern-day currency.\r\n\r\nProphetic medicine is the total authentic Hadith narrated by the Prophet, peace be upon him, in relation to medicine, whether Qur'anic verses or honourable Prophetic Hadith. It includes remedy recipes, by which the Prophet, peace be upon him, was cured or he called people to be cured by. Furthermore, it includes recommendations relevant to human health in the conditions of life, including eating, drinking, housing, and marriage. It comprehends legislations related to medication, medicine in practicing the profession, and the guarantee of the patient in the perspective of Islamic Law. Ibn Al Qayyim, may Allah be merciful with him, in his book Zad Al Ma'ad Fe Haday Khair Al Abad, said: “The medicine of the Messenger, peace be upon him, is not similar to the medicine of physicians. \r\n\r\nIn KSA alone, 3.8 million cases of diabetes were recorded, thus warranting increased global health concern. Scientific evidence has accorded the claim of several plants and honey listed in prophetic medicine, which improve glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus. \r\n\r\nMuslims turn to the Quran and Sunnah for guidance in all areas of life, including include health and medical matters. The Prophet Muhammad once said that \"Allah did not create a disease for which He did not also create a cure.\" Muslims are therefore encouraged to explore and use both traditional and modern forms of medicine and to have faith that any cure is a gift from Allah.\r\n\r\nIf you like this Application please consider leaving a positive review and/or rating for it in the store. \r\n\r\nDo not hesitate to make your comment, suggestion, advice and so on via kzapps88@gmail.com\r\n\r\nTraditional medicine in Islam is often referred to as Medicine of the Prophet (al-tibb an-Nabawi). Muslims often explore the Medicine of the Prophet as an alternative to modern therapies, or as a supplement to modern medical treatment.\r\n\r\nTraditional Islamic Medicine and Remedies\r\n\r\nHerbal Medicine And Medicinal Herbs\r\n\r\nHere are some traditional remedies that are a part of Islamic tradition.\r\n\r\nOne should always consult with a medical professional before attempting any treatment. Some herbs may be harmful in certain conditions or when consumed in the wrong quantities.\r\n\r\nWhat Is Herbal Medicine?\r\nHerbal medicine, also known as herbalism or botanical medicine, is a medical system based on the use of plants or plant extracts that may be eaten or applied to the skin. Since ancient times, herbal medicine has been used by many different cultures throughout the world to treat illness and to assist bodily functions.",

Prophetic medical traditions exhort humans to not simply stop at following Muhammad&#39;s teachings, but encourage them to search for cures as well. The literature of prophetic medicine thus occupies a symbolic role in the elucidation of Islamic identity as constituted by a particular set of relationships to science, medicine, technology and nature. There has historically been a tension in the understanding of the medical narratives: are they of the same nature as Muhammad’s religious pronouncements, or are they time-sensitive, culturally situated, and thus not representative of a set of eternal medical truths? [2] This body of knowledge was fully articulated only in the 14th century, at which point it was concerned with reconciling Sunnah (traditions) with the foundations of the Galenic humoral theory that was prevalent at the time in the medical institutions of the Islamicate world.[3] It is nonetheless a tradition with continued modern-day currency.<br><br>Prophetic medicine is the total authentic Hadith narrated by the Prophet, peace be upon him, in relation to medicine, whether Qur&#39;anic verses or honourable Prophetic Hadith. It includes remedy recipes, by which the Prophet, peace be upon him, was cured or he called people to be cured by. Furthermore, it includes recommendations relevant to human health in the conditions of life, including eating, drinking, housing, and marriage. It comprehends legislations related to medication, medicine in practicing the profession, and the guarantee of the patient in the perspective of Islamic Law. Ibn Al Qayyim, may Allah be merciful with him, in his book Zad Al Ma&#39;ad Fe Haday Khair Al Abad, said: “The medicine of the Messenger, peace be upon him, is not similar to the medicine of physicians. <br><br>In KSA alone, 3.8 million cases of diabetes were recorded, thus warranting increased global health concern. Scientific evidence has accorded the claim of several plants and honey listed in prophetic medicine, which improve glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus. <br><br>Muslims turn to the Quran and Sunnah for guidance in all areas of life, including include health and medical matters. The Prophet Muhammad once said that &quot;Allah did not create a disease for which He did not also create a cure.&quot; Muslims are therefore encouraged to explore and use both traditional and modern forms of medicine and to have faith that any cure is a gift from Allah.<br><br>If you like this Application please consider leaving a positive review and/or rating for it in the store. <br><br>Do not hesitate to make your comment, suggestion, advice and so on via kzapps88@gmail.com<br><br>Traditional medicine in Islam is often referred to as Medicine of the Prophet (al-tibb an-Nabawi). Muslims often explore the Medicine of the Prophet as an alternative to modern therapies, or as a supplement to modern medical treatment.<br><br>Traditional Islamic Medicine and Remedies<br><br>Herbal Medicine And Medicinal Herbs<br><br>Here are some traditional remedies that are a part of Islamic tradition.<br><br>One should always consult with a medical professional before attempting any treatment. Some herbs may be harmful in certain conditions or when consumed in the wrong quantities.<br><br>What Is Herbal Medicine?<br>Herbal medicine, also known as herbalism or botanical medicine, is a medical system based on the use of plants or plant extracts that may be eaten or applied to the skin. Since ancient times, herbal medicine has been used by many different cultures throughout the world to treat illness and to assist bodily functions.",

The simple user interface makes it a great tool even for those not so familiar with modern technology.\r\n\r\n✓ This app is perfect for patients of all ages. Particularly for seniors to eliminate missing a dose.\r\n\r\n✓ It enables you to schedule various medications with multiple doses at different times of day.\r\n\r\n✓ It Offers simple, modern and clean user interface.\r\n\r\n✓ Website access available at https://web.pillreminderapp.com\r\n\r\n✓ It securely stores your medication history and you can generate weekly, monthly, or yearly reports to help your specialist with the progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe app comprises 5 major sections: \r\n\r\n\r\n💢 Medication Reminder\r\n💢 New Measurements\r\n💢 Doctor Visit\r\n💢 Vaccine Reminders\r\n💢 Water intake & Diet Tracker\r\n\r\nHere’s what each section does:\r\n\r\nMEDICATION REMINDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is where you manage all of your medications. Here you set reminders for each medication to avoid missing doses. Notifications remind you to follow your medication regimen.\r\n\r\nTo set reminders, you will first need to indicate whether you are taking pills, syrups, or injections. You can set reminders on them collectively or separately, depending on how you use them. Daily reminders, weekly reminders, monthly reminders, and yearly reminders are all available.\r\n\r\nAnother great feature of this section is Inventory Setting. Here you can enter the number of medications left in your medical box and tell it to send an alert when you are left with a certain number. The app will notify that ‘You are running out of medication’ as soon as you reach that amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nNEW MEASUREMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis section lets you store various health measurements such as\r\n\r\n✓ blood pressure readings, \r\n✓ heartbeat rate, \r\n✓ sugar level, etc.\r\n\r\nIt contains standard measurements for each health problem and matches them with the readings you take to see if you are doing well. For example, the normal blood pressure reading is 120/80. Also, this section creates a timeline of each reading on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Using this timeline, your physician can easily monitor your results.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTOR VISITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a great feature that helps you to set reminders in order to keep track of upcoming doctor appointments.\r\n\r\nFirst thing you will need to do is to add the doctor to the Pill Tracker App. Next, you will enter the date and time at which the visit will occur.\r\n\r\n💢 An awesome thing about this section is that it lets you record the audio of the entire conversation between you and doctor by their consent. \r\n\r\nDoctors often give you a lot of information quickly. This will help you keep record of the doctor’s advice and replay as necessary to confirm your understanding. Also, the Important Note feature in this section helps you take written notes of everything that the doctor says. \r\n\r\nVACCINE REMINDERS\r\n\r\nTimely vaccinations are important to ensure healthy growth of your child. To make things easier, use the\r\n\r\nVaccine Reminder feature \r\n\r\nof our app. Here you will find numerous vaccination schedule templates.\r\n\r\nThe section has two features:\r\n\r\n✓Active Vaccines\r\n✓Schedule Vaccines\r\n\r\nIn Active Vaccines, there is a list of vaccines that you can select from to indicate the ones your child has already received. It has built-in templates for vaccinations like measles, polio, severe hack we call it whooping cough, and others. Here you can set reminders to ensure your child receives timely immunizations. \r\n\r\nDiet & Water Intake Reminder:\r\n\r\nAs a part of 1.1.5+ version, you can also track your daily water intake, track your breakfast, track your lunch & dinner and any custom diet plan. \r\n\r\nGetting timely water reminders helps you keep hydrated throughout the day.",

Following are the new features:<br><br>- Track Water Intake and get a reminder for configured water in take<br>- Track and get reminder for your diet.

            "could you add the option to simply select name, every x hours, for x days. and starting time for first intake. so that I don't have to count or calculate***absolutely anything***. This app already has one function but it reminds for every x days. I want to be reminded every x hours during x days. Also I have to calculate the days on the calendar till the exact day for the med will last, while you could simply ask for the number of days.",
            "This app would be ok if you are only taking one medication at each notification. I take 6 different meds at 8:30. It's a pain to mark one, then have to scroll back down the list the mark the next one. And it's very hard to change the time for a med. As soon as I find another one, I will delete this app.",
            "It could be great. But the reminder only goes off one time. If you don't hear it, it will not remind you again. would be nice if it would alert every few minutes until you respond, at least a few times.",
            "I'm impressed by the sophistication of the app, and how great the level of detail is when creating medications and setting up reminders. Unfortunately this isn't matched by its usability: navigating the different sections is quite clunky. The most frustrating aspect of this app is confirming medications were correctly admnistered, using the controls inside the notifications pop-ups. These are a great idea, however they don't work as expected, which in my case resulted in inaccurate stats.",
            "It's a really good app. However I'm taking away 1 star for some annoying features. When you get the pop-up you can click you've taken it or to snooze it (cool feature) but then it takes you to the app (WHY?!), instead of going away like a normal notification. And then, whenever you wanna exit the app, it asks you for confirmation. Both things are annoying and unnecessary!"

        "comments": [
            "Upgraded from 2 to 5 stars. The problem with the mysterious 12am alarm (which this app was setting) has been fixed, so it no longer interferes with 'Do not disturb'. I think the app looks nice, is easy to use (used for a single daily reminder) and no ads.",
            "This app is nice, compact, app, with no advertising - a critical feature for any app dealing with medical anything. It's good for what it does, although I can see that any users needing more than \"4 times a day\" would find that to be a shortcoming. It's ok when it is running - alarms show in your notification for the next due date/time for a medication. However, once I was not using it, I had to uninstall it. When there is nothing scheduled in the app, it still schedules a midnight alarm every day. It also does not admit this - and Android shows this midnight item as 'next alarm', but you have no idea where it is coming from.If you have a 7AM alarm set with the clock, it will not show as 'next alarm' until after midnight. I only sorted this out by deleting my apps, one at a time, until the special alarm went away. Without this problem, this would be a four-star review. But - an app cannot be permitted to interfere with the operation of other key features on the phone/tablet, even accidentally. I will watch for a fix, but until this is resolved, this gets one star. EDIT: After dev response: I look forward to the update. To be clear, the interference with understanding of regular alarms when your app has no actual events planned is not unique to your app, many reminder apps are encountering the same thing. Perhaps you could switch to only scheduling the \"exact\" reminder when there is actually medication due in the future.",
            "Data management is good. The main purpose to download this App. is to remind to take medicines as per the prescribed tmings with the help of an alarm ring. This is missing. Not happy & satisfied with this \"no-alarm ring\" facility to maintain the timings. I will wait for two more days and the App. would be unstalled soon if not improved its performance.",
            "Easy to use, with a logical set-up. This app does exactly what I want from a pill reminder and I have not missed a single pill since starting the app. A couple of small improvements would be welcome: A pill taken after midnight counts as missed. Pills for the same prescription taken at the same time have to be individually logged.",
            "Gets the job done if you only have 1or 2 prescriptions but for people who take multiple medications at a time it is annoying to have multiple alerts simultaneously. It would also be nice to just tap \"taken\" instead of having to log each and every one. An \"as needed\" feature would be helpful."

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training.

The optimal choice of injection route is not always obvious, especially if the conditions of administration (emergency, particular patient) do not allow time to consult documents and instructions for use which are sometimes very dense. True therapeutic tool, this work makes available to the prescriber or the user of injectable drugs, clear and practical information presented in a synthetic way in the form of tables thus allowing a fast and effective use. It specifies for each drug the route of injection and the conditions of administration commonly practiced, as well as the monitoring of the treatment, during and after the injection. Written in the form of files classified by specialties and by DCI, this book recalls the trade names, absolute and relative contraindications, the precautions for use and the storage conditions of each drug. The indications, dosages as well as presentations, dilutions and administration are detailed according to the chosen injection route. For certain drugs used with the electric syringe pump, tables of infusion rates are available. This practical guide to injectable drugs in pocket format is a unique and original tool for all practitioners, interns, medical students, nurses and student nurses. In addition, this book is complemented by an online supplement making available to the reader downloadable sheets of less common but equally important drugs.

            "This makes absolutely no sense to have on subscription and the lifetime cost is an exorbitant $34.99. It's just a searchable list. You could easily just convert this into a spreadsheet. Obviously a lot of apps like this are being created just to prey on people's problems as opposed to actually helping.",
            "Great app, however I would have given you $3 - $4 for a permanent unlock with no ads. But $69 for lifetime access ! Someone thinks too highly of their glorified list displayer. Let me just burrow your JSON db from GitHub and I'll create my own free version.",
            "I have GERD, and relatively my body rejects many foods, and this app is PERFECT for helping me know which foods I should have and shouldn't have, I hated having to experience my body disliking and rejecting the food for myself, but with this app I no longer have to try things and deal with the consequences, with a click of a button I can see if it'll cause my body to react or not!! And it even lets you know which foods are remedies! Overall this app is great and can really come in hand😁",
            "Not anything I didn't know already once I paid for premium. I was under the impression it would be a diary I could log my trigger foods and tailor my diet. The ingredients aren't elaborate enough it's quite broad. It's basically a paid list on subscription its not worth it at all. Subscription is pointless.",
            "I consider it a really great app. It's nice to have it on hand for a quick search when you're in the grocery store and try to sort things while dealing with acid reflux. Plus it is really great that they continue to update it and give the option to ask for requests for the future list. One thing I hope they'll add in the future is ingredients as well. I constantly look at the list of ingredients for everything, and I'm always nervous with things like malic, folic and ascorbic acid."

            "This app overcharges, and is difficult to cancel. I was using this until I could find a doctor to see in person. Once I had and went to cancel this, I was still charged enough though I had not spoken to a lemonaid doctor to renew my prescription. I received a response of asking if my mental health was okay to my message requesting to cancel.",
            "This app is awesome i just renewed my prescription for another year. I love that i was able to pause and continue my prescription when needed with a simple phone call. Also that everything gets delivered to my door automatically so im never able to forget about it.",
            "I've been using this app to get my birth control for about 2 years now. I have them send the prescription to my local pharmacy. The doctors are always polite and professional. The app is easy to use and I've never had any issues with it. Love the fact that you can call or message them any time if you need an alternative prescription and they reply pretty quickly. The short phone consultations are great too!",
            "This app is amazing! I was able to get my birth control perscription sent to my local pharmacy very quickly. In the end, this visit was quicker, more affordable, and much more accessible than what was available locally! Update: I was even able to refil my perscription through their pharmacy for my next refil for quite a bit cheaper than my local pharmacy. I can not recommend them enough!",
            "well I would like to use the app but all I get is a spinning blue circle saying please wait at every single step I've had to restart my phone at least half a dozen times and it still doesn't work even though I have full Wi-Fi connectivity like seriously what in the actual f***? UPDATE: called and was told that bluetooth interferes with connectivity - ok - turned off bluetooth - that seemed to work - THEN the app stalled out with no way to proceed as I was trying to input my CC info - what garbage - just another rush to market useless app from the graveyard of failed ideas that is Silicon Valley - maybe all of the homeless urine in San Francisco is interfering with their product - who knows - but I give this app -800/10. USELESS!!!"

            "This app has changed the game for me when it comes to going to the pharmacy. Whenever my girlfriend sick (or myself) I just put in the symptoms and it gives me medicine that will help with every symptom I have. I'm no longer having to buy five different medicines at the same time. Not only that it gives me the location where this medicine might be my local pharmacy. And the prices so I can go get the cheapest one. It also has Amazon prices in case I want to buy a lot at once if I need to use the medicine frequently. And unlike WebMD or something like that it doesn't make me feel like I have some rare disease, it gives me something country I can work with that actually helps solve my problem instead of worrying about it. 10/10 would recommend.",

            "Stellar authors/researchers of modern naturopathy. Elsevier's universalized reference app user interface is elementary, especially considering the intellectual complexity of the content. 1.

I'm not taking any medications for this yet either, but this app keeps harassing me to list mine. I'm going to visit a doctor soon for this condition, but I wanted to have a log ready using this app. Apparently, it's not easy.",

        "description": "Wellcome in Apps Antibiotic Dictionary\r\n\r\nAntibiotic is an agent that weakens or destroys bacteria; antibiotics are medically used to treat various types of bacterial infections. The various types of antibiotics work either by preventing an infection from growing or by destroying an existing infection. Antibiotics are produced either from a mold or a fungus or are produced synthetically.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What are the various types of antibiotics and what do they do?\r\n\r\nCommon forms of antibiotics include aminoglycosides, macrolides, penicillins, tetracyclines, and cephalosporins.\r\n\r\nAminoglycosides work by interfering with the protein formation of bacteria. Aminoglycosides include gentamicin, amikacin, and tobramycin. Side effects can include damage to the nerves of hearing and balance, as well as kidney injury.\r\n\r\nMacrolide antibiotics interfere with the protein formation of bacteria during multiplication. Erythromycin is a macrolide. Side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort.\r\n\r\nPenicillins (discovered by Sir Alexannder Fleming in 1928) work by damaging the cell walls of the invading bacteria as the bacteria reproduce. Penicillin G and V are widely used for streptococcal and other bacterial infections. Broad-spectrum penicillins, such as ampicillin and amoxicillin, are used on a variety of infections caused by gram-negative organisms. Hypersensitivity reactions, for example, a fever or a rash, are fairly common side effects of penicillin use. Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) rarely occur, but can be life-threatening.\r\n\r\nTetracyclines, which are active against a wide range of bacteria and other organisms, are thought to prevent production of proteins in the invading bacterial cells. The tetracyclines include tetracycline and doxycycline. Side effects of therapy may include gastrointestinal irritation, sensitivity of the skin to sunlight, and liver and kidney injury. This group of drugs should not be administered during the last four to five months of pregnancy, nor should it be given to children before the age of eight years. Permanent discoloration of developing teeth may result.\r\n\r\nCephalosporins are relatively new antibiotics active against a wide range of bacteria. Like penicillins, they interfere with bacterial cell wall formation. A frequently used cephalosporin is cefaclor. Side effects include rashes and fever. Sometimes, persons allergic to penicillins will also be allergic to cephalosporins.",

        "description": "Herbal medicine has been used to treat or alleviate virtually every possible medical condition. \r\n\r\nHerbalism (also herbal medicine) is the study of botany and use of plants intended for medicinal purposes. Plants have been the basis for medical treatments through much of human history, and such traditional medicine is still widely practiced today.

I hope in the future they can make it so that you can still use the outdated app for a period of time after the update is pushed to avoid the issue of downtime. Original Review: App won't let me into the main menu. Keeps saying that there's an update and redirects me to Play store. Once I'm in Play store there's no option to download a newer app. I think the service is great but this error keeps happening so I can't use it.",

            "I tried a different app like this one and didn't like it at all it didn't work. so I researched and found this one, I have nothing but good things to say. My experience was way better then I expected, dr. Peppercorn was awesome, he is very knowledgeable,explains everything, makes you feel comfortable, listens to you, he cares, follows up and answers all questions quickly. He has made my experience great and I will use this app again if I need to and hopefully I get to have him again as my dr.",
            "This is awesome! Since everything is slow right now (COVID) I looked into online options. Right away they were able to tell me if they accepted my insurance and estimated my copay. I answered a few simple questions regarding my symptoms and after discussing a treatment plan with the doctor, I was able to pickup the medications prescribed at my local pharmacy next day. SO fast and easy! I will be using this anytime I need a derm.",
            "Update: Maybe it's not a scam afterall. Finally got some medication 14 days later and 38 days later for the other meds. The\"visit\" is text message format and lasted about one week because of approx. 24 hour delayed responses from skymd. Refused to refill my script I've been using for years and they never responded to the pharmacy, resulting in no medication for two weeks. It's $90 for each visit because insurance companies don't cover e-visits. If you can wait a month for meds, go for it."

Again cdc is failing to up keep there mistakes & fixing it in real time.",
            "I was hoping to have a singular app for calculating doses. Sad that the CDC app is missing IV dosing for pain medication. This basically makes it worthless for hospital work.",

            "These guidelines, active since 2016, have taken away the rights of patients suffering from relentless chronic pain and their physicians. The very people that extended release medications were designed to treat are being denied their use and offered meds in strength and quantity to last for a few hours a day if any alternative at all. The return of severe and relentless daily pain and denial of appropriate medications are the result of the CDC's answer to the country's (unrelated) opioid crisis.",

It is very helpful and time saving whenever yo need it.",
            "Excellent app!! Loved how efficient and helpful it is. The food suggestions are so useful. It's an all in one app that helps identify my deficiency and suggests an all natural way to correct it. Really exceptional!",
            "I love this app! I think there is more scoring emphasis on vitamin deficiency vs mineral deficiency though...I also wish there was a related app that would explain potentially why the deficiencies if you are supplementing with there already",
            "I'm quite sure that this app saved my life. For the last year and a half, my health declined to the point that I was bedridden over 95% of the time. Doctors couldn't figure it out and neither could I, despite being a scientist and reading nutritional research as a serious hobby for a couple of decades. In the app, you enter symptoms, and then it will ask a series of questions to narrow things down. This is pure genius- it asked things I had going on and would not have thought to put together. They also cut across medical specialities if the issue could include nutrients that are important for several functions. This app let me know that I was highly likely to be deficient in a particular micronutrient, and possibly a second one. The app then gives a list of foods to get that nutrient (it was only showing a list for one food per query). I went with a supplement to correct this, and within hours I started improving- not a placebo effect, swelling was going down and energy, up! In a few days I was able to do chores that I hadn't been able to do in ages. Thyroid hormone levels are recovering, too! This app is new enough that it can be a bit glitchy when you start up, and it would be nice if in the future the list of foods included how much of the nutrient each of them contain, and give a list for each nutrient identified in the report. At the moment, without that, you can at least look over the list of recommendations & that helps. I saw that I hadn't been including those foods for years (work injury destroyed income & former, more varied diet) so it seemed reasonable that I'd be depleted. It would also be a nice improvement if they were to give info on the correct form for a supplement. Though it emphasizes getting nutrition through diet, that isn't always possible, and bioavailability matters. I highly recommend this app. If you use iOS, you must wait. I tried to get it for someone else and we were unable to get it through either play store for her iPhone. I'll be doing the updates, and again must point out that as it is, this app can already be a life-saver.",

            "The service is AMAZING! I have no regrets using this app to chat with a doctor for something quick. The reason I knocked 2 stars off though is the AI at the start of EVERY chat. It only lists symptoms and takes you through a very thorough, automated chat session. If you are someone who doesn't know what you're dealing with it would be really useful, however in any case where you know your issues, such as Asthma and you're in need of a simple prescription/refill - it'd be nice to skip it.",
            "These doctors are awesome! They listen to you and help you! I didn't think it was real at first. But I had an ear infection and a doctor wouldn't see me for a month. So I tried this and they called in ear infection meds instantly and they said 3-4 days before your better but I started feeling better in an hour! Excellent app!! Thank You for having this available. Highly recommended!!!",
            "My experience was great!! I'm so glad this worked just like it's promised to. I paid for the service of $19 and was given a receipt through email. After downloading the app I answered some questions about my issue, took maybe 10 minutes, and was then directed to a certified doctor. She asked me a few questions and sent the prescription I needed to the pharmacy of my choice. I called to verify if they'd received it and sure enough it was and being filled. I highly recommend this service!!",
            "Its okay, but it always takes you to worst case scenario. Like I have pain in my ribs. Localized, no fever, no headache, no chills, no sneezing, no coughing, no shortness of breath, wasn't near anyone sick... It told me I either had an upper respiratory or pneumonia. I actually somehow tore the cartilage between the ribs, likely from lifting something too heavy. Bruised ribs wasn't even a suggestion.",
            "Very user friendly simple AI. Very cool AI also asks your symptoms to help diagnose incase one is a closet hypochondriac.suppose one could get a subscription monthly and just see what one might MAYBE could sorta kinda have. If that were the case just saying cause I thought it was superfluous knowing already what I had and what I needed medication for but for real diagnosis there is the option to speak to a dr. And if possible they prescribe a medication for you and send it to your pharmacy"
