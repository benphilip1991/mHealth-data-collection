        "description": "Buddo is a 90-day mindfulness meditation course for people who stutter. Manage your fear and anxiety caused by stuttering through our mediation exercises. \r\n\r\nUnlike traditional speech therapy, the course helps you achieve greater fluency with mindfulness and relaxation techniques.\r\n\r\nThis course was designed by people who used to stutter but were able to become stutter-free thanks to the mindfulness meditation practice. The emerging research on mindfulness and its effects on stuttering suggests that this ancient technique can have profound benefits on how a person who stutters perceives himself/herself. Regular mindfulness practice helps lower levels of stress and anxiety caused by stuttering, improves self esteem, and in many cases helps people to control their stuttering. \r\n\r\nThe 90-day course consists of 9 parts, 10 sessions each. We recommend that you complete one session each day. Preferably in the morning but any other time of the day is fine too. What's important is to practice regularly. This course can be repeated many times. In fact, we recommend that you repeat the course at least 3 times to get more benefit out of it. \r\n\r\nWhat will you get from the course:\r\n\r\nSpeak with more confidence\r\nReduce stuttering\r\nLearn to remain calm\r\nReduce speech anxiety\r\nIncrease mindfulness\r\nBecome a happier human\r\n\r\nYou can try this meditation course risk-free with a free trial.

I then tried some wired headphone but the app doesn't recognize them. The app is filled with ads and in-app purchases for what feel like basic things and doesn't seem to work properly at what is offered free. My conclusion is to uninstall and advise all to look elsewhere.",

Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",

Big issue though is that it needs internet access to open the app. Big turn off not being able to use the app at all in offline mode.

            "no words at all. it's an amazing and ultimate app. I suggest the speech therapy clinics can use this app to train their patients and they can suggest. I like very much. hats off team bhavajeet... also I am seeing so many comments like adds.. adds.. I can say that, for play store apps, the only support and revenu will come from adds. and that too there is no those many adds.",
            "I am a Speech-Language Pathologist in the US, working with geriatric patients. This app claims to be designed for aphasia (a language disorder, generally in the adult/geriatric population), but seems much more appropriate for expressive language disorders in children (which is characterized by children having difficulties forming language, but can pronounce speech sounds correctly). Regardless, if this app encourages practice to reach goals set by a trained/certified SLP, it is beneficial.",
            "theres no tutorial or feedback, no clue how to use this app, I have neurological slurred speech so need feedback. need interactive or at least info on what to do and I hear bell intermittently and no idea what its for, time to end my frustration and delete worthless app",
            "Absolutely a good companion app for Broca's Aphasic patients. And For Kids a very good for learning, quizz time, and it helps a lot in nurturing them in education.",

            "I don't understand your developers at all. You made this for a gag? But it's a delayed audio feedback device. For stutters like me, this is a great tool to overcome stuttering. AND IT WORKS GREAT!! Why are you passing this off as a gag instead of an amazing tool for stutterers? Even the apps that do the same, but for helping stutterers don't work as well as this one. The feedback delay is excellent. You can use this app to HELP MANY MANY people. Isn't that better than whatever it is now?",
            "I realise that this is a free app, and it has to make money, but there are no skip buttons for the ads, you need to sit through them entirely. I do appreciate them giving a selection of things to read from to test the effect the jamming has on you, but I personally did not experience this effect while using the app.",
            "While the app does technically do what it's supposed to do, the delay in play-back is too great to have any real effect on speech fluidity (at least for me, and I have no formal vocal training). I didn't notice myself struggling at all, and even recorded myself twice reading the same speech to make sure - first with the app on and then once without it - and there was no perceptible difference in my prosody whatsoever.",
            "Alright, now hear me out, here: even if it doesn't work at messing you up while talking, it definitely improves your tolerance for your own voice. Knowing myself, I'd expect to have trouble with this, given that I usually stutter quite a bit when talking to other people. I give this app a 1 because half the people who have used it can speak perfectly fine. It's got no effect on your speaking whatsoever.",
            "Awesome, these people up the street have hearing and listening devices in my house. I think it's just what I needed. I have 5 phone's to set off in my home and it definitely works !!!!! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!!!!!!"

The App can also be used with adults to work on articulation, speech and memory.\r\n\r\nSpeech and Language Therapists will find a selection of vocabulary which progresses in levels of complexity.  The target words are carefully selected to represent differences in word position, sound complexity and word structure.  The app also features a useful ‚Äòrepeat and record‚Äô facility.\r\n\r\nThe App contains interesting photographs and illustrations across a variety of topics.  The pictures include common objects, nouns, action words and describing words.  These are an excellent resource to support vocabulary development.\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n-  These exercises cannot replace therapy sessions with a Speech Therapist. Using the app helps with daily home practice, making practice fun and motivating.  It is important for a family member to be present and support the child with their practice.\r\n\r\n-   Before starting these exercises, clients must be able to produce the sound in isolation and in simple syllables.  The exercises and games will help to develop the use of the sound in more complicated words.\r\n\r\n-    If you are not sure what to do, check with your Speech Therapist.",

AST can also be used by older children and adults who have speech sound problems. The app uses pictures that are attractive to children to help them improve their speech sound production and in turn forms an easy home tool to supplement therapy implemented in the clinic which might minimize the duration of therapy and number of visits to the speech clinic. AST includes all the standard speech sounds in Arabic and 84 short syllables (i.e., consonant+ vowel) and includes 252 picture-word stimuli form everyday life. At the beginning of therapy, the speech therapist chooses the target sounds to train the client on in therapy at the clinic. Then, the clinician explains the use of the app to the parents and or client depending on the age of the client to help provide more training opportunities on the target sounds outside the speech clinic. This app can augment what a client is trained on at the clinic which might help accelerate gains in speech therapy. A user can choose the sound to train on by pressing the icon of the sound on the screen and then choosing the desired syllable and then choosing the words that contain the sound. We hope you find the AST app helpful and fun to use.",

This version supports telephone use for incoming and outgoing calls it means you can use App while making outgoing or receiving incoming telephone phone calls on your Smartphone. If you&#39;re using older version ( 1.1 ) App 2beFluent already you should uninstall your App and then install it again.",

            "Very simplistic app that doesn't work well. Horrible customer service. The developer and I had a misunderstanding and instead of valuing his customer and reacting with compassion he insulted me via email, calling me pathetic, saying that he felt abused because of a negative review I gave him. I'm honestly still in shock over his behavior.",
            "I'm 100 % fluent when I use this App and I don't feel any blocks, my speech is easy and calm . This is great App !"

            "It is a good app but I am upset because I was charged for months after the trial ended. I thought I had canceled the subscription on the app itself. When I finally realized I was being charged $37 US per month I figured out how to canc it through Google but was told there is a no refund policy. I did not use the app after the trial period and think I should get my money back. Apps make it easy to use but difficult if you are trying to unsubscribe or cancel.",
            "I believe the best feature of this help is the videos of kids are actually kids. They don‚Äôt sound bossy as an adult would seem to a kid with autism. Since they‚Äôre peers to my daughter, she gets encouraged to imitate them and learn from them. We‚Äôve seen the improvement in weeks. She sounds better day by day and the app is obviously beneficial but also fun at the same time enough to keep her focused without feeling like lectured."

            "Problems for people with dimentia or Alzheimers... It is NOT appropriate to ask them how well they are remembering things, understanding things, etc.as this app does with the user. Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

When I finally realized I was being charged $37 US per month I figured out how to canc it through Google but was told there is a no refund policy. I did not use the app after the trial period and think I should get my money back. Apps make it easy to use but difficult if you are trying to unsubscribe or cancel.",
            "I believe the best feature of this help is the videos of kids are actually kids. They don‚Äôt sound bossy as an adult would seem to a kid with autism. Since they‚Äôre peers to my daughter, she gets encouraged to imitate them and learn from them. We‚Äôve seen the improvement in weeks. She sounds better day by day and the app is obviously beneficial but also fun at the same time enough to keep her focused without feeling like lectured."

        "description": "Speech Therapy: F\r\nDoes your child have trouble saying F? We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: F is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say F and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice F with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo I created this not so fancy app to help reach this goal! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say F correctly in the word \"frog\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices F by saying \"fork\" while eating, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say F\r\n~Tips on how to teach F to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online F flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying F\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on F for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying F!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

This app isn't ideal for what I need as I was hoping it would help show how you should make the sound or form it and play back how I sound. Instead it has you say the word and passes you if it can recognize what you're saying or not. It's cute. Fun for my son to play with, but not helping well with my speech."

            "Problems for people with dimentia or Alzheimers... It is NOT appropriate to ask them how well they are remembering things, understanding things, etc.as this app does with the user. Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

            "I paid for the full app since it seems the most like the one my daughters speech therapist uses with her. I could be great if it acually worked but it seems as if it did not fully download. I only have maybe 1 out of every 10 pictures on the flashcards. Most videos do not seem to be available. PLEASE FIX!! Ok so after reading other reviews I uninstalled and reinstalled app. Works fantastic now. Would be helpful if they would mention that this seems to be necessary for app to work properly.",
            "It would be great. But I purchased the full version and 60% of the flashcards are blank and say error when you tap them. Memory match freezes a lot Not worth the $20 Also individual letter sounds would be amazing",
            "I would give this app 0 stars if I could, this is a rip-off, be very aware of the \"sale\" it makes you think you are unlocking all the letters for 19 dollars and some change but they only unlock one letter, so if you want to unlock all the alphabet be really to spend OVER $500 dollars, they got me with almost 20 dollars so I'm wondering how many more people are like me falling for it.",
            "Highly recommend. I have used this app both for helping with articulation speech therapy and for kindergarten phonics with my son. It was invaluable in both instances. It is comprehensive and easy to use. Thanks for a great app!",
            "I wish I knew how to get a refund. It isn't child friendly. You can't count on the glad cards having sound, which is the important part. More time was spent trying to get card to read themselves, than actually using the app as meant too."

They've never gotten the proper visual feedback from me when sounds were said in error; they just got my very green attempt at audio feedback/direction (I'm a CFü•¥). I love the option to do a 3D visual and the animation. I'm just in awe and so glad to finally feel like I will be making a dent in my kids' goals with the help of this app. Thank you.",

            "I would love to see two things; possibly three. First, seeing a üëÑ forming \nand saying the word would be outstanding. Second, younger children with \nlearning issues do not understand the ALL CAPS. Like we adults would like \nto think they would. Words and sentences are not written that way and it's \nquite confusing. all lower case makes much more sense, üòä. Third, and what \nwould finally make this app worth it's weight in gold is if it had a \"MY \nSPECIALS\" or \"SAVE\" tab. Where specific cards could go, no matter what \nsound they were, to work on later. I have looked through so many apps and I \ncan't find any that fit. My youngest works a little here and there bouncing \naround. It's frustrating.",

            "Subtitles under illustrations are partially hidden behind the progress indicator at the bottom of the screen. The level 7 and 8 buttons are also cut off, to the extent that they are almost unusable. This ia a wonderful app with partial words and illustrations of complete words. This app was just what we needed for home speech practice. It is best used when I can sit with my child and give my complete attention to pronunciation and correction. More illustrated words would be a great addition to this app. Thank you for the option of turning the voice over off."

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: K is an all inclusive app that teaches you how to say K and then how to teach and cue your child how to say the sound. We will then walk you through how to systematically practice K in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say K correctly in the word \"cave\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices K by saying \"kick\" while playing soccer, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say K\r\n~Tips on how to teach K to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say K and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say K correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online K flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying K\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on K for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for K even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

Many children have difficulty saying it correctly, but don't worry! We are here to help your child today.\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: R is an all inclusive app that teaches you how to say R and then how to teach and cue your child how to say the sound. We will then walk you through how to systematically practice R in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say R correctly in the word \"rake\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices R by saying \"more\" while playing blocks, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say R\r\n~Tips on how to teach R to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say R and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say R correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online R flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying R\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on R for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for R even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

        "description": "Made by people with OCD, along with some of the world's top experts. NOCD offers live video-based OCD therapy and in-between session support, right in the NOCD platform. Get matched with a licensed OCD therapist in your state from the comfort of your device, and start effective OCD therapy via video, text, and more.\r\n\r\nLive video sessions with an OCD Therapist:\r\n- Match with an OCD therapist\r\n- Personalize your treatment plan\r\n- Do ‚Äúface-to-face‚Äù ERP therapy online through live video sessions\r\n\r\nSupport between each session:\r\n- Use OCD therapeutic tools 24/7\r\n- Message your therapist anytime\r\n- Learn what helps other people from a peer community\r\n\r\nWHAT IS OCD?\r\n\r\nOCD is a common psychiatric disorder that involves repetitive, unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors intended to reduce the anxiety caused by those thoughts. Commonly misunderstood as an annoying personality quirk, OCD usually involves intense distress and can become completely debilitating.\r\n\r\nIS NOCD THERAPY EFFECTIVE?\r\n\r\nNOCD live video therapy has been shown to be as effective as face-to-face therapy. Our model is research-backed by a Columbia University Medical Center study, which found a reduction in OCD severity by an average of 40% in 8 weeks.\r\n\r\nWHO ARE THE NOCD THERAPISTS?\r\n\r\nNOCD therapists include licensed counselors, psychologists, and social workers, and they all are trained in exposure and response prevention, or ERP, the most effective OCD treatment. All NOCD therapists are managed by our clinical leadership team, who have 20+ years experience treating OCD and have designed some of the world‚Äôs top OCD treatment programs.\r\n\r\nIS NOCD SECURE?\r\n\r\nOur services are powered by AWS and Aptible, both of which are SOC2 and HIPAA compliant.

It is reckless to create space for recovery & have no enforcement of healthy habits. Carl is the only active moderator. Tools are great. Community is toxic & will make newbies sicker",

Aphasia is always due to injury to the brain-most commonly from a stroke, particularly in older individuals. But brain injuries resulting in aphasia may also arise from head trauma, from brain tumors, or from infections.\r\n\r\nAphasia can be so severe as to make communication with the patient almost impossible, or it can be very mild. It may affect mainly a single aspect of language use, such as the ability to retrieve the names of objects, or the ability to put words together into sentences, or the ability to read. More commonly, however, multiple aspects of communication are impaired, while some channels remain accessible for a limited exchange of information.\r\n\r\nIt is the job of the professional to determine the amount of function available in each of the channels for the comprehension of language, and to assess the possibility that treatment might enhance the use of the channels that are available.\r\n\r\nIn this App you can find more information on the different types of aphasia such as Global, Broca‚Äôs, Wernicke‚Äôs, Primary Progressive, Anomic, and Mixed Non-fluent aphasia.",

            "We've been trying for a while, but my 2.5 year old is not interested in trying to repeat the words. I'll likely cancel after the first year. Suggestion for the app developers: In the activities where the kids are teaching a new word, you should add a picture of the item in the corner of the screen while the kids say it. Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",
            "Kept seeing ads for this, so I downloaded it! Started the free trial before I decided to buy a subscription, and so glad I did! I couldn't even get a single activity done. There was no sound, the screen kept freezing and the app keeps force closing. Waste of time.",
            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",

            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

            "Excellent little pocket operator kind of app that runs fine on pixel 3a. Note to the developers: I did have trouble opening after updating to Android 11. I would get a black screen of death which seemed to be related to OS level permissions requirements changing in os update. After uninstalling and reinstalling twice I'm ok now but there seems to be an occasional bug emerging on app initialization. It could just be another sloppy update from google and has nothing to do with you but just FYI.",
            "The app is great, but there's a major problem encountered on both a Xiaomi Redmi Pro 4 and a Pixel 4a. While looping a sample, the sound suddenly overdrives like crazy. I didn't press anything, just kept it looping. This happens with a stereo mini jack to a PA system. Love the app, would be great if this could be fixed! Thanks.",
            "Using this app to trigger old movie/audio samples from my Arturia Keystep Pro. Works perfect for my needs. I love how I'm able to add some awesome effects right within the app. I do wish that the sample filename would show somewhere. Makes management a bit difficult.",

HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. üòí",
            "For those of you dealing with the app getting killed in the background regardless of your battery optimization settings...try Mindroid. This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "It's a shame that this game doesn't give you the coins you win. Played the daily challenge for 30 days and won the 200 coins, yet I didn't get them. Tried to contact them but the have no direct message. There is no use playing if you're going to cheat me out of the winnings. Also need to work on the words. There have been many words that you say no that are.....",
            "Great game which is addictive, I play this all the time because it is simple yet fun. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because there is one improvement which would be good to see in this game; and that would be an option to change colours of the block and background. Having played the game more 100s of times, seeing the same colours does make it dull. If this small update was implemented, it would make a huge difference.",
            "I am giving this a low rating because of all the ads and the fact that you can get rid of them for 4 bucks but thats just for 30 days. Seriously???? Also the landscape never changes even though in the ad it showed green grass which looked cool. Shame on you devs. Where are the levels in the pictures and trailer? It's a great game but it's the same thing over amd over again.",
            "Not what was advertised when It was an ad, I saw ad and was like woah that looks like a fun little game so I downloaded quickly without investigating, only to find this completely different game so for that I give a 1star. But it's a fun game so 5 star. DO NOT LIKE BEING TRICKED HOWEVER. Shame on you if you're in control of false advertising. But a fun game so I'm conflicted.",
            "The music is peace allowing you to think ,no time presure,which allows you to relax,and the background pic is beautiful. No ads intrupt while your trying to think.So if you like block puzzles I highly recommed trying this one."

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",

I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

        "description": "Do you know that 80% of learning problems are reading problems? Difficulties, such as dyslexia or hyperlexia, in reading can explain 60% of school failure.\r\n\r\nReadUp by Glifing is the game that improves children's reading and reading comprehension using the Glifing method. It is a method that children with reading difficulties can benefit from, regardless of whether they suffer from dyslexia, reading disorder, ADHD, Down syndrome, specific language disorder, stuttering ..., as well as children who already read well but want to read with more fluidity and ease. In addition, it is a complementary application to those already used by schools to teach reading and to reinforce reading. There are already more than 80,000 children around the world who have managed to improve.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is aimed at children between 6 and 12 years old who are learning to read or who want to improve or perfect their level. Children with 4 or 5 years old who have a knowledge of letters can also play and learn.\r\n\r\nAvailable in Spanish and Catalan.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is divided into reading levels. At the beginning of the game, a level test is carried out on the child to know what their reading level is, this reading level is not linked to the school year, in this way they can learn and improve from their real level.\r\n\r\nWithin a reader level there are islands and each island has 30 missions to complete. In all missions you are accompanied by the Readup dragon. This friendly character is the mascot for the child and provides instructions to the adult or tutor on how to carry out each of the missions.\r\n\r\nA mission brings together all the phases that make up the Glifing method:\r\n\r\n1. Phonological path of reading. Train decoding by reading pseudowords.\r\n2. Lexical path of reading. Train the recognition of frequent words globally.\r\n3. Memory training. Strengthens memory, where the phonological imprint and visual memory are improved.\r\n4. Reading comprehension. It requires understanding in the context of previous mission activities.\r\n\r\nIn each mission you can get up to 3 stars, these are determined according to the successes that have been completed in each of the previous activities.\r\n\r\nFinally, so that the playful part of the game is understood, at the end of the mission, there is a minigame, the objective of which is to feed the dragon, and here you can also obtain gems depending on how well it is done.\r\n\r\nStars and gems can be used to customize the dragon in Readup's Dragon Shop. Therefore, the more you play, the more missions will be completed, and the more fun customizations you can make to the dragon.\r\n\r\nWe believe that parents or guardians are an essential part in the education of children, for this reason, in each mission it is required that the lexical and morphological path activities be carried out jointly with them, that is, it will be the parent or guardian who determines if the child has pronounced the word correctly. When it is not possible to be together, the tutor mode can be disabled and those missions are marked with an exclamation to remember that that part is missing to complete it. We know that there are automatic methods of voice recognition, but we are committed to strengthening the relationship between parents (or guardians) with children.\r\n\r\nGlifing is based on its own method registered under a research project carried out at the UB (University of Barcelona).

            "There were no navigation buttons. Just 3 recommended streams. I would say that the streams were on my homepage, but there dont appear to be any other pages. I thought this was a chatting/friendship/dating app based off of youtube ads. False advertising and lazy design. Uninstalling. Don't download",
            "This app is great the reason why I only give it 4 stars is because of the fact that it is easy for younger people to get through and I have had it happen to me so many times that I have had to kick and report a child just for being on the app in my stream. It's never fun but rules are rules. Also it's a little annoying how every time you use a image from your gallery for a background it makes a copy of it I have like 10 of the same image now because of that.",
            "I actually really enjoy this app but the problem is I noticed the more popular people that do live calls struggle to get on the phone with everyone because of the one person on the phone at a time thing. I think it'd be wayyyy better if you put it where mutiple people can talk on the phone like maybe 5 at once or something because if not then it gets kind of annoying and frustrating with everybody wanting to talk on the phone at once.",
            "I first got this app back when its logo was yellow and before it updated (Idk what version that was). I got rid of it to clear some space for an Azur Lane update. Now that I'm coming back to it, I'm happy to see it hasn't changed much. Thanks for this app, I may not get many viewers when I practice my piano, but I still love preforming for people. Have a great day <3",
            "By far the best live audio app I've ever downloaded. The people on this app are amazing and you're guaranteed to find an amazing community to become a part of. As a streamer myself I can only say good things about spoon for the fact that they actually listen to suggestions and do their absolute best to make sure you have a good time using the app. Spoon streamer - üëÅÔ∏è‚É§GildanmanüèÜ"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

While I've not been an avid user until recently, I assume these are new issues. If not and these have been known issues, gyst.",

Also, the app actually works, unlike some other social media sites that couldn't make a functional product if you gave them 13 years and $1.1billion. (*cough* Tumblr *cough*)"

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

Big downsides: Diamonds which you need to send digital \"gifts\" to the broadcaster are expensive, e.g. 450 for $10 but gifts vary from 1 diamond to 9999. Another big downside is there are several scammers with fake profiles now. When they latch on, you'll just want to leave. Basically, \"a license to print graphics\".",

If there was some sort of log in and out feature for the app, I believe the entries could be saved on any device the app is used on. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
            "What a rip off, the 'phrases' and 'sentences' are literally the same for each word in the set of sounds. For example, if you do B sentences it will be 'Bob will beg for a big banana', and then 'Bob will beg for a big ball'. Saying the exact same sentence with one word difference is ridiculous. Don't buy.",
            "I signed up for the free trial and couldn't hear any sound. I then subscribed for a paid version even though I still had the free subscription, and still no sound coming out from the app. I sent a mail to you yesterday about this and I haven't gotten a response. It's getting really frustrating!!!!",

            "I've been using Clue for a solid 5 years now, and I really like the app. I've only had issues with the new update. The app has been throwing me out sometimes when I press the \"back\" button. Also, whenever I try to reorder my tracking options to my taste, it doesn't register them and shifts them back to the original, unwanted order. I also don't like that the \"track today's data\" button on the centre of the cycle got removed. It was super convenient and I'd want it back. Otherwise love the app.",
            "Please help! This app is amazing but it's starting to be weird!- Basically, it keeps tracking stuff on its own and it changes everything. It completely destroyed everything in my cycle! It made the period length from 5 days (which I am) to 1.5 days! And it keeps tracking to heavy bleeding etc when I'm not bleeding at all! I love this app so much and I really need it to work. Why does it do this? What can I do about it? Did someone possibly \"hack\" me without knowing and starting tracking?",
            "Easy to use and unobtrusive experience. I haven't gotten enough cycles yet for symptom predictions, but just the act of tracking them has gotten me in better touch with what's going on. The app has useful information as well. I am not subscribed and just using the free version. I'll think about subscribing when I see how the experience is with predictions.",
            "Edit: yes! The lock is 'fixed'! I now need to punch in my pin everytime I navigate to a different screen in the app instead of just once! Great work guys! /sarcasm. This app has gotten really pushy with trying to get you to pay to the point I want to uninstall. To top it off , the password lock is no longer functioning even though it's on in my settings.",
            "Idk what they did to the app because after an update around september, it startes crashing when i tried to use certain features. I knew it wasnt my phone because many people complained about the same issue around the same time and I was hoping they'd fix it. Instead, the problem got progressively worse to the point where i get error messages telling me the app isn't working or that it needs to close when it's already supposedly closed. Years lost cause now I can't even get my data back. Trash."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "Thanks Brothers, I love JW app üíóüíóüíó However, recently I am experiencing an issue with it and I am wondering if you would be able to help me please. It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet ü§óüíñ",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

Still not allowing me in! Have emailed the one given on this page and no response.",

Update: I keep getting red flagged and keep getting asked to verify over and over again even though I had several times. This is so stupid. Update again: they won't let me come back in! Saying I need to change passwords but they won't let me! Horrible site. I'm deleting forever and telling others to never use this site.",
            "Extremely disappointed with this app. For whatever I have been flagged twice in a week. Third time within a month. I have already proved I'm one hundred percent real but this time I am trying to verify no matter what I do it's not letting me. I don't want to lose my account because I have many people I talk with. Ridiculous. The biometric is stupid and should be updated.",
            "I was having a great time on the app. I've had it for a few years now and have gotten a few good dates off of it. Now the verification process won't let me back into my account though. I've been asked to verify twice in one week. The most recent time I was verified by picture then it asked me to change my password. Problem is I signed up with Facebook and therefore do not use a password to log in. I emailed a few times trying to resolve this issue and still am locked out.",
            "Crashes constantly when microphone or camera permissions are denied. Randomly opens these video feeds in the corner of the screen, not sure if they're some kind of ad or someone's live stream since there's no explanation for them, but not fond of them randomly opening like that if they are live feeds, especially if it is opening up my camera and mic when it does it, but again, there's no explanation, so I've just been closing them."

            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

I think this might be the best app I downloaded in a while.",

My 2 year old loves it.This is a great virtual picture book that has nice colourful illustrations/pictures that are in both English and in our case Spanish.Since we are bilingual family. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a bilingual app for children!",

Squash that, this is that new normal, that next paradigm. So let me drop a dime, in the phone(cellular). I made this song in one night, during a fight, between me and my wife. I didn't have any time, but it came out sublime, wife'ys calling it a crime, gold it glows, but silver it shines, 9 times. Outta ten..zen",
            "This app rewards people for copying and singing over other artists vocals. It also rewards the same 10 - 15 people every week. Admin don't reply to queries and they also don't stick to the rules. The same rules they expect their users to stick to. If you make your own cover art and mix your own tracks Its like you're less likely to be rewarded. They also judge tracks even tho they don't make music which means they don't even know what it takes to make tracks.",
            "Not bad! I like the concept of the app and it's pretty dope. Wish there were more functions. I've been waiting to relaunch my YouTube channel and music too so this was a pretty good idea to start networking. Try it out. They have samples and demos and easy to use",
            "I love this app but right now its giving me a hard time trying to use special features like I usually would it does not even let me see the words at the bottom to apply it... whats going on with the app??? And yes I am a Suscribed member for the year.",
            "The app is decent, still room for improvement though. How about adding a info bar so the producers can give details about the song structure, bpm, and instrumental etc? I have been wanting to write songs for the longest, but without that info i cannot do it."

It is completely malleable, and it addresses all levels of\r\nmemory, knowledge, comprehension, reading, and writing.  From a child stricken with\r\nlow-functioning autism, to a senior citizen who has had a stroke and now suffers from\r\naphasia, to someone who has had a tracheotomy or laryngectomy, to someone suffering\r\nfrom MS, Cerebral Palsy, Lou Gehrig‚Äôs Disease, brain trauma or legions, or to a person with\r\ndeafness or muteness who wants a convenient way to communicate with people who don‚Äôt\r\nknow sign language, VOCALYX can be a life changing tool to those who need it.\r\n \r\nIn short, VOCALYX can compensate for three types of speech problems: vocalization\r\n(for example in the case of throat cancer), language (as is the case for aphasics), and\r\ncommunication (in the case of autism). The principle is simple: you click on an image (a\r\nphoto, pictogram, or text box) within a premade or personalized keyboard, and VOCALYX\r\nsays the message for you through the use of voice synthesis, or with the recorded voice\r\nof either the user or someone close to him/her.\r\n \r\nThe parameters are 100% customizable to meet the needs of all our individual users. This\r\nincludes: the size and number of buttons displayed, the length of button presses (useful\r\nfor people who tremble because of Parkinson‚Äôs, Lou Gehrig‚Äôs, or MS for example), the\r\nsynthetic voice (age, gender, speed), and there are several different forms of visual\r\ncommunication.\r\n \r\nThere are keyboards made up of pictograms, photos, and prewritten phrases, as well as\r\nABCD and QWERTY keyboards. When using the pictogram and photo keyboards, you have\r\nthe option of either using the images we have already provided and organized, uploading\r\nyour own personal images, or searching through photo and pictogram databases, like\r\nARASAAC, MAKATON, or PECS, and downloading a wide selection of images.\r\n \r\nAn internet connection is not required to use VOCALYX, except during the registration\r\nand the initial set up. It is usable in all situations and any normal place one would go on a\r\ndaily basis. Take advantage of the free trial and discover how much this AAC tool can help\r\nyou or someone you love!

When using the pictogram and photo keyboards, you have<br>the option of either using the images we have already provided and organized, uploading<br>your own personal images, or searching through photo and pictogram databases, like<br>ARASAAC, MAKATON, or PECS, and downloading a wide selection of images.<br> <br>An internet connection is not required to use VOCALYX, except during the registration<br>and the initial set up. It is usable in all situations and any normal place one would go on a<br>daily basis. Take advantage of the free trial and discover how much this AAC tool can help<br>you or someone you love!  When the free trial is over, you can buy VOCALYX per number of<br>clicks, or as a 1-time final purchase.<br> <br>VOCALYX Features Summary List:<br>‚Äî Free trial available!<br>‚Äî Pay by number of clicks or as a 1-time final purchase<br>‚Äî Fully mobile, VOCALYX can be used anywhere<br>‚Äî Adaptable to all needs<br><br>‚Äî Rehabilitation tool with a speech therapy team<br>‚Äî Adaptable synthetic voice (age, gender, speed of speech)<br>‚Äî Record personalized voice messages<br>‚Äî Use personal photos or choose from photos and pictograms offered through the app<br>‚Äî 1000 pre-programmed messages for helping communication<br>‚Äî 800 images and 1200 pictograms available to meet individual needs<br>‚Äî Create your own messages<br>‚Äî QWERTY keyboard with word predict<br>‚Äî An unlimited number of personalized messages<br>‚Äî Combine the use of photos, pictograms, and phrases to send texts/SMS or emails<br>‚Äî Display settings are customizable (button size, number of images shown on each page)<br>‚Äî Share your exercises with your speech therapist",

            "motivating, fun, exciting and immersive! I adore the detailed audio when incoming zombies or distant gunfire sound as if they're truly getting closer with your pace. \"Letters\" will also be e-mailed to you as you journey through this story. The free version is worthwhile for those looking to enjoy this a couple times a week, since it takes a few days to unlock each episode. Whereas subscription is worth it when you're looking to progress almost daily like myself. I love it!",
            "My favorite running app but... I like it for the entertainment. While the app is much less glitchy for legacy users than before, the distance is way off. I can walk slowly and it will say that I have done a mile every 6 minutes, when I have walked maybe half a mile or less. However, I do love the incentive to run when I have the Zombie chases on, it gets me going and has helped to make much progress.",
            "I love Zombies! Run!! I started running from zombies with the Abel gang in 2018, and never stopped. I only got 2 episodes into Season 1 before I started my subscription, and it has been worth every penny! This is the ONLY app that I cannot think of one single critical comment about. The stories are interesting, the actors are extremely talented, and if the need to find out \"what happened next\" doesn't get you moving, nothing will. Thank you, Six to Start!",
            "I just love this app, it got me running outside for the first time and made me want to go just to hear the next episode! The storyline is great, the app is easy to use and when the zombies chase you, you can't help but sprint ü§£ü§£ Wonderful concept and so glad I found it! The other areas of the app like the 5/10/20km running plans are valuable and building up my base is a fun twist too. I recommend this app to everyone, its honestly the greatest motivator!",
            "So I have tried this on 3 different phones and had the same issue. Audio works for about 10 mins and then app goes silent. Have tried with / without music, internal and external player...no luck. As for not looking at app once started...need to remove that statement. Also, no headset start stop. No doubt the OS will be blamed, so uninstalled cause probably no resolve."

        "comments": [
            "Been playing this game for a couple of months now and still enjoying it. Ads are very short and do not interrupt gameplay. You can also opt for the ad free version. I personally especially like the challenge levels and the opportunity to watch full ads in order to earn rotations which can be saved and help loads if there are no suitable spaces left. A great game. No complaints at all üèÜ",
            "Love the game! However, to earn extra rotators you have to watch commercials. Sometimes many many commercials. The commercials are redundant. Based on your online searches, the commercials are geared to your interests. But if you enjoy watching American Girl 5 maybe 10 times in a row, this might be the game for you. They also offer different wood block games and show you those commercials over and over and over again. You would think if they would be a little creative.",
            "Great gamec- I initially liked this game. At first you could get a free rotator every 5 minutes plus a 30 second ad. Now I have to wait for a free rotator every 24 hours. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. I am part of a group of people who download games, test them, and grade them and pass our comments to them who then pass the recommendations on to everybody in the group and then we pass them on to our friends and family. I do not recommend this game in any way whatsoever.",
            "I Love Puzzles!!! Been playing this game for about a year or so and it's always fun and challenging. I enjoy a challenge with games like this! I will continue playing it. Happy to see the feature added of being able to rotate the piece to fit where you want it. Cool! Thanks!! Continue with enhancing the app to be even greater! üôÇ",
            "Rubbish app, spent more time restarting app than playing it. The first few days it was fine but as I ran out of rotates I watched a couple of ad's, to get some more, the app never worked correctly after that. It just kept freezing up. Was fun to play but since there are several versions I might try another block game"

            "I have had multiple apps for rides but none compares to calimoto. There are more things to do than just track your ride and choose other's rides that they have done. I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one‚ù§Ô∏è!",
            "AVOID AVOID AVOID. Requires an account just to see what features are available, restricts what maps you have access to strict \"regions\". Totally useless for my use. Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",
            "Great route app but you do have to check the route after it is generated. Sometimes it will send you down and obscure street and then turn around and rejoin the route.",
            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

            "I went to the gym for years but I have achieved the best shape of my body thanks to this app! It gives you the motivation, discipline and helps you build the proper technique. I would never imagine an app being that much effective. Instead of paying crazy amounts to the gym, you should download this app and enjoy sessions at the comfort of your home or by the sea or in a park",
            "Updates spoilt the workouts. Pull ups became monkey pull ups. Stretches became a bunch of stuff that need equipment such as bars and benches to complete. The main workouts are still good. The demonstration of the workouts became poorer. With more technique required for stretches, I think they need to add a \"it was too difficult, I couldn't do it\" option. If you don't have the mobility required, it is a matter of just waiting for the time to past.",
            "Really cool app! I enjoy the training so far. The only thing is that you can't say you can't do XY exercise for XY reason. So you're stuck by saying you completed the exercise but you didn't perform well. Or try hitting the \"adapt session\" button and create a hole new training for the day while I only wanted to change 1 exercise.",
            "Always exactly the same exercises day after day, week after week. Lunges, squats, lunges, squats, reverse lunges, cossack squats... its harrowing to say the least, my knees feel like i may as well be 78 in the shade they click more and more each day because this app thinks that leg day is every f#@$%ng day. Tried a different training journey using weights, and the first thing they asked me to do was, surprise, lunges with the himalayan mountain range resting on my shoulders. Ffs im a beginner.",
            "*FREE*Letics?... So I entered my goals, height, age etc and opted for the free version. I was given a workout programme which looks perfect for what I need (Hybrid Strength), only to then be made to pay to see the exercises and details? Absolute joke"

            "App is decent for online meetings. I use it for group meetings as well as one on one collaboration. It is as good as zoom and some of the other platforms out there. I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

They try to say it's a filter thing, as if I would not be smart enough to test out if my filters were the limiting factor. Not 1 user of *any* broadly defined \"filter parameter\" exists in my city of 1.6 M ppl. If I use the premium \"global search\" feature (which does in fact exist) to then search any specified area, it will ALWAYS show people far away from that area. This problem is not on my end.",
            "The app is a scam, free version gets you nothing but spam, paid version they literally just took my money and didn't provide the premium service, which I paid for 1 year.

            "Can only upload pics from the camera app on the device, or Facebook. The pics I want to use don't exist on either, so pretty much useless. Edit: thanks for the tip, but that's definitely not the issue. I haven't even tried uploading because I can't access the pics I want to use. They're not on Facebook or my phone's camera app.",
            "This app is truly terrible. On first impressions a few months ago I had more faith in the app because I was surprised with how many people were shown living at least 20-50 miles from my area. But now after you've viewed somewhere in the 200s of people's accounts near your area, they suddenly can only show people who live almost 100 miles away from you, regardless of how long you've been off the app for. Don't know if they stop showing new accounts near us on purpose or just a glitch....Just sad",
            "Waste of time. There's no matches anywhere close no matter what you set the radius for. They were unhelpful with contacting saying to just restart the app and that if there aren't people near me that the default is to ignore the radius.... I don't want to talk to someone 700 miles away.

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: T is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say T and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice T with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say T correctly in the word \"taco\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices T by saying \"teeth\" while brushing teeth, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say T\r\n~Guide on how to teach T to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online T flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach T to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying T\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on T for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying T!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. And it contains less ads. nd its a very easy game. I love to play itüëçüëçkeep it up I will also suggest to my friends. Its a game to kill time. I love it sooooooooo muchüëåüëåüòäüòä its better than other games and its name is also very very good. It contains new bottles and new stuff.I vl always give it 5 stars Regards Maiyra Narang",
            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. Super-Realistic graphics, (as the name itself says, 3d), the outdoor one is really cool. There are no bigs, but the ads are bugging. Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up üëçüëç",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",
            "Bottle flip 3D it is such a good game it's like it's so addicting but there is one downside to it there's no way that you can like play together cuz me and Avery like to play and we wish there was a way that you could like do it together or there was a leader board or scoreboard or something just so that we could know if you are good at the game and there's not a lot of ads and I really love this game so please can you like make a bottle for 3 2 or can you make a upgrade ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° good job!!!",
            "It is a good game but way too many adds! AND level 63 is in possible to beat I think I tried it about 26 or even more times. üò° My advice don't waste your time and data on the continues for levels in the 50s or 60s. ü§î Hopes this helps people who have read this information üòÅ bye peeps! üëãüòé"

            "Don't, just don't. I got into the 4400's for my level, so I played this quite a bit. They even got me to shell out money for the events a couple of times, which no other game managed. 500 characters isn't enough to fully explain why this isn't worth your time. And when I post this,if I get a reply from the company, it will be an insincere copy-paste that screams minimal effort for maximum money grab. You will spend less money if you just buy a mobile game. Also, the deceitful ads are a thing.",
            "Same matching game it always has been. They REALLY need to stop advertising it as a different game. They even went through the trouble of adding an initial level thats like the advertisements and then it goes back to matching gems....they could EASILY create the same style of game with different ways to earn the energy you need to complete tasks. I would love to see them develop a similar game with a play style similar to the click-bait ads they create.",
            "Started off as a very good game, but at level 64 it has become impossible to advance without spending money. Very poor as it reels you in then basically the only way to advance is to spend spend spend. Have tried over 80 times and its the same outcome because you don't have enough turns to complete the level. IF the developers respond I guarantee it will the same stock answer they all use. Very poor indeed. Have now uninstalled.",
            "When you reach a certain level, you are mandated to play a Tournament of Champions. You cannot play the regular game. So if you are in the middle of a game and the game expires before the tournament is over, you loose your points and potential winnings. Some people paid to get coins to play these games which is a huge waste of money. The game designers should either be ashamed of themselves or be sued.",
            "Such a great game. What I like the most about this is that it does not have ads. Not even a single ad since the day I first played it. Such a nice game. Playrix company always make great games. So, this was all its praise. But the reason I gave it 4 stars is that the levels are too hard. Hey hey hey! But not every level. I mean 2/5. And it is specially mentioned there that the levels are going to be difficult. But we can clear the levels by using power ups. This was all my suggestion. Bye."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "It is a good game but has its quirks. The bone pile is hidden during play and only visible when you draw from it. If you're not careful and hold the piece while you're placing, it, it will go to the closest matching piece. When the game is over, it covers the board so you can't review the game. Scoring is puzzling, for instance; our team score was almost 8000 and overnight dropped more than 2000 points. There is no way to remove deadbeat or caustic players from the team.",
            "Love the game, the colors and play of the game is nice. but there is an error with this app...Whenever there is a draw, the computer automatically gives the round to the opponent/computer. Also, tap-to-play causes misplays. This app can be better by:. 1) Showing how many bones are left in the boneyard. 2) allowing online play with other humans. 3) making a 3-player, and 4-player option. 4) add a carribean style play mode, where you don't win by points but after a set number of games one.",
            "Needs updates bad! The boneyard play is awful. Whether it is in my favor or not, it is ridiculous how this one pull gets the exact domino needed for an advantage, it is frustrating when you strategize to send your opponent to the yard and for them to only pull one bone nearly everytime and it's usually the exact one needed. I would be here all week describing the scenarios that I've witnessed, but overall it seems like the game leans in favor of the player of it's choice. IJS",
            "Downloaded this game as something to help me wind down (and at first it was) but, with all the updates, it's turned into a constant source of frustration. The scripting is so obvious I can guess what domino the computer will play without even seeing their dominoes. This game has gone very downhill very quickly.",
            "I've been playing this for about a year and have begun to notice that there are about 8 - 10 games that continually repeat, it's like being in \"Groundhog Day.\" I didn't notice this at first, i thought it was random shuffling, but am seeing it more frequently for the last month or so... Today the game played first, starting with a 3x6 domino, then on its second play it played a double 6! Very frustrating! The game doesn't even follow its own rules, i.e., the first player starts play with..."

The app is poorly designed, with programming errors one would not expect to encounter in a payed for service. Do not expect any real assistance from their customer help department either and be prepared to reach a new level of frustration when using this app. Btw, customer service in Brasil is particularly lacking.",
            "App does not initialize, unbelievable. It would be convenient to me if it would accept Sodexo Alimenta√ß√£o card. By not accepting this payment method, it makes my experience near 5 stars. Other than that, the service has been meeting what it has been advisertising. However the app for smartphone gets frozen quite often when initializing, which is another minus one star on my rating. Minus one star again as the bug initializing has not been fixed. It simply does not work any longer.",
            "Good, but never use the Whim feature. Someone at Rappi made the incomprehensible decision to make critical UI (the button to approve payment) available only in a notification. If you don't receive this notification (for which they suggest to restart your phone??), support is useless for resolving the situation. My Rappi had to pay out of pocket just to move along the order. Rappi: never make critical UI only available in notifications (that you already know don't always show up!)",
            "Internal ads are severely impacting UX. Pop-up ads will sometimes block critical UI elements like the restaurant search bar and interstitial ads will prevent the user from viewing their current order status and appear to not be immediately closeable. These are poor design decisions that should be rolled back in a future update.",
            "Very poor user experience and UI. It could be significantly improved with some proper front end developers who can make it more clear and strait forward. Also, I had an issue where the delivery driver delivered the wrong order. I was reimbursed for the order but not for the delivery, so in the end I paid a delivery driver to not deliver my order. I argued that it should be reimbursed and was refused. Due to this experience, I have not used to application when Uber offers a better service."

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you HiyaüëÑ",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put √¨n my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

Hence my lower star rating. Surely you should be able to unlock without watching adds when you've paid for no adds? Big downside!",

Camera does not accept micro usb, cameral will not save pictures and had deleted pictures on SD card without warning, apps have been slow or icons show they are there and they deleted by the update etc..Not happy at all.",

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

Then there's the battle pass, premium pass, and thats not even getting to the pop ups after every game spamming you about other deals you can buy. The devs have something here, for the 1%.",
            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",
            "The game was great. Addictive. I am free player and been able to reach to lvl16 but the pain is to constantly watching ads. I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack. But still lots of fun. However this is definitely a pay to win game. Want you obtained Max rank all your characters you cannot continue to advance the upgrades without spending money"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

That was a few hours ago ive come back and now some of the songs i made are gone (i think the app updated) which is really disapointing because i really liked some of those if you could get the songs i lost back then my rating will change to 5 stars",

        "description": "Speech Therapy: N\r\nDoes your child have trouble saying N? We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nN is one of the first sounds a child learns how to say. When he/she doesn't say it correctly, it can be frustrating! To ease this frustration and provide parents with all the tools they need, we created Speech Therapy: N. Speech Therapy: N is a comprehensive app designed by an ASHA certified, practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say N and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice N with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say N correctly in the word \"north\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices N by saying \"nighty night\" while playing house, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say N\r\n~Tips on how to teach N to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online N flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying N\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on N for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying N!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

When you end up watching them to get the extra shots, it still makes it impossible to move past. And tbh it backfires because eventually after a few attempts over days, you get fed up of the whole game and find something new to play. Not happy with it",
            "Some users are complaining about the bubbles, and how the useful colours don't show up until it's far too late to win. I've been playing this game for a very long time, and I can say with 100% certainty that this was not the case until the last few updates. Clearly the game is becoming more about the ad revenue. The events and races are also just messed up (some days they're there, and suddenly you open the game and it's no longer there). Point is, I'm too annoyed to continue with this nonsense.",
            "The app is not working properly . It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly. It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly then there come 3 options:- 1. Send feedback 2. Open app again 3. Close app . But now the problem is solved and I have completed almost 1600 levels. It's an excellent game to play . Please download this game",
            "Bubble Shooter is grt fun when yr bored & it is casual and reminds u of arcade machines back in the day. It does have annoying adds and it can hoax u when you watch a video for Bonus Shots. But overwise it is amaze! Good times playing it, but even if u played every day for a year you still wouldn't finish Level Mode, cuz it has litterally over 2000 levels! I'm not kidding, play it & see. The graphics are grt and they have decent contorls. Overall its a grt game, which is grt fun.",
            "This could be a great game. I am a very good player and in the first 20 levels (the easy ones) more than a 3rd of all bubbles could not be used becuz the color was blocked or so far up unreachable. And worse yet it gives you the same non useable color over n over n over again in row til you get to the last 10 shots then gives u a useable color too late to have any chance of winning. This is not a hard game at all. Is just rediculously unplayable."

The new update is ok, although I don't like the appearance of the toilets, bathtub and the pool, green makes it look like they're broken. Also can you fix the sound? Apparently everyone now has Tom's voice instead of their own voices.",

The minigames are great(my favourite is sky skater) the only requests I want to have is 1. Make more toys in the treehouse 2. Make costumes more easy to find 3. There should be a makeup table ( we could also do it for the boys too and see how the girls would react to it) it's a great game though five stars!üòÑüòÑüòÑ",
            "I have rated this game with 4 stars..because there should be many more features if you give some more things etc..would enjoy the game a lotttt..I liked it so much than other games. Appreciable. My wish is please add features like there should be makeup room for Angela etc.., changing dress for Tom, ginger etc..,and in the house there should be some more like all the six should play hide n seek etc..And one more can you add 3 to 4 people moreüòúplaese can you. N how 2 update there's n option"

        "description": "Speech Therapy: B\r\nDoes your child have trouble saying B? We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: B is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say B and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice B with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. So, I created a not so shiny app that will actually help your child. In order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say B correctly in the word \"border\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices B while playing and saying \"ball,\" carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say B\r\n~Tips on how to teach B to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online B flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying B\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on B for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying B!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "I like this game a lot it goes pretty smooth for my phone and it brings back memories because I used to have it and got it again now!but there is defenently one thing I would change. i spent a lot of time to try to get a legendary and I did but it got me the same one a few times so please make it so that you cant get the same vehicle twice it kinda wasted my time.",
            "The gameplay is good, but for the love of dogs, RANDOM POP UP ADS, WITH SOUND, AFTER EVERY MATCH? SERIOUSLY? Come on BearBit Studios, you're better than this. I know you can fix it by playing with wifi off, but what if i want to stream music while playing? For un online game I'll put up with short ads, as servers cost money to run, bust smashy road has NO online and thus NO SERVERS. this is outrageous.",
            "I play this game a lot, and it is really fun. But i have some suggestions for a future update. 1, the tanks are too fast, 2 the tanks reload speed is also too fast. 3 the car f1 needs something else, like a 5x faster cash, because it dosen't do anything but go fast. 4 please make it so that the cars don't slow down when they are in the grass. I also want to add a new car in the game, it would be a car that when u get arrested, you turn into a cop car and get 5 seconds to get away.",
            "I love this game i absolutley love it the chase speed cars etc is a lot of fun but theres 1 problem. When you get exploded by an oil truck sometimes you get thrown under the map which causes you to fail and i think that should be fixed but other then that 10/10 thank you.",
            "In my personal opinion smashy road wanted is in okay game however I have witnessed a few glitches during the gameplay your probably going to ask what glitches am I discussing about allow me to explain your driving on the road right? then suddenly you crash into a gasoline truck falling threw the map another thing when accidentally bump into one of the bigger police vehicles when you try to back up the car proceeds to go forward eventually you get arrested I do not recommend this game"

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! üòä",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "I really like it. Nice selection of easy, medium, and hard. Some ads but few thankfully and not intrusive. Am really enjoying it.",
            "Awesome app. Challenging if you want it to be or relaxing if you choose the easy mode. Very user friendly too.",
            "I like that it tells you if you have the wrong letter and if you get stuck you can ask for a letter. The questions are general knowledge. Another app had their puzzles according to different subjects so if you didn't know anything about that particular subject you were lost. The easy ones are hard enough for me but I like that you have a choice for people that might be more skilled in crosswords. (Smarter than I am!)",
            "Update: Some of the Clues & Answers seem to be aimed at the \"boomer\" generation and the C&A's are repeated often. It's still a great crossword game, It's a simple design, user friendly, it costs nothing to use hints. Which is great for anyone who wants to unwind. Not everyone knows who the star of \"touched by an angel\" is. And that's ok! You don't need to know. Use the hints that don't require you to watch ads, spend coins, wait (X amount) time or cost you money. Be free & relax üòä",
            "Used to be great, but now ads are too intrusive. Before, a simple silent ad would pop up and you could tap through it. Fairly low annoyance factor. Now, massive full-screen ads with obnoxiously loud audio FORCE you to watch videos for games you don't want. The frequency of the ads has increased too. The game is great otherwise, with a solid easy interface and good features. Used to be a lot of fun but I am sadly going to have to uninstall."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

I tried everything, deleting and reinstalling, updating, restarting my phone, logged out and in. Still doesn't work. My wifi is also perfectly fine with other apps and webs.",
            "This works ok. I been getting annoyed because I don't always get a notification that I got a message. For example ill randomly open it and than it will tell me I got a message a few hours back im like WTH it's supposed to tell me when I get it. You guys need to fix that issue it happens too often",
            "It works most of the time, what irritates me is the lack of fluidity of the performance given by the app when using it even on the highest-end devices. Other third-party apps on my phone works fine, smooth like butter except LINE, it stutters frequently without any explanations or whatsoever. I hope this can be fixed in the future. And I also hope that it will be more optimized for tablets because, I cant use the app on landscape mode except in chats....which is.... odd.",
            "Please fix the verification problem. When I log in on my laptop, the phone won't show box to put in the number. Used to work regularly until yesterday. Perhaps it's because I chance my email and it's a bug? QR code log in is fine but I don't like to do it every time I turn on my laptop. Please fix this and I will rate back to 5 stars. Thank you.",
            "The reason why i gv 3 stars,it becoz when we login in other device all chat disappear. Line gv an option to save the chat to google drive,unfortunately every time I try to sv in drive,its not works. Eventhough if it works sv in drive,still faces an isssue which is we cant open it,or its not appear directly like in other apps did. It would be great if Line can make all chat not dissapear,like messenger on FB did,which is the chat appear same like when the last time i see in other device. Thanks!"

            "Useless. GPS tracking does not work, tried everything, app usually gets stuck on loading, the features are not user friendly, very limited, very clunky. It's a really slow, limited and badly designed app with inadequate features .",
            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",
            "Can't even log in. It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later. And i could not even log into the app to change for fix anything. And the whole program does not work or link at all with my other son's ipad.",
            "I'm not very happy that Norton does not provide coverage for Microsoft Explorer. Also if you add a website to the unblocked list they are not unblocked immediately. They have a few kinks to work out for me."

At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",

Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",

I've downloaded this on multiple phones, I just wish there was an apple version of it.",
            "It's Great! Does what it says it'll do and so far and especially with as much as I use it, no crashes, glitches or stall outs, (which used to happen a couple of years ago with older version of both app and phone). I've always re-downloaded this app specifically because of its definitive reliability for all that I need it for. It's also a definite 'must have' for interviews, appointments, sessions, and lectures whenever needed. (Only thing I might ask is for more updates playback options) Thanks",
            "Great, simple app that opens quickly, is easy to navigate, and does exactly what it proposes to do and nothing more. When a native recorder was added to Android recently I considered switching to it, but it has a fatal flaw: it's difficult to get your recordings out of it. This app records things to a well-known place that it shows you via its settings.",
            "I've been using this app for a few years now to record song ideas and stuff and they finally asked me to rate it so I decided hell yeah why not this app is a free high-quality recorder and has helped me out immensely and they don't constantly bombard with ads and and ask you to rate all the time I noticed this was the first time they asked maybe they just do that now but anyway I said \"let's do it.\" Hope u like that sentence. üòé This is my primary recording app and I prefer it over the others.",
            "Why all the high ratings for this I just ran the app and tested the recording quality of talking with my phone locked and my phone was directly next to me and all I got was muffled inaudible garbage. Perhaps it is good for speaking directly into the mic recording but if you need to record a class or something with your phone closed it seems this isn't the app for it. I had high hopes for this app back to the drawing board."

            "I received a mini microphone as a gift and it's instructions were to download a karaoke app. I tested it out and it worked well. I just need to use the app more.",
            "Besides Fairytale in Malay, I did not find any Chinese song I was looking for. Nor does the application have all the National Anthems. Got this app & within 10m it did not meet expectations. First reaction when scrolling through categories was that there was KPOP. Initial Instinct was there were INTL songs. When I searched for more INTL songs there wasn't one. This is not \"Unlimited\" as the title says. A Premium Account is needed to unlock some songs & there are none Chinese songs that I found.",
            "It is a very good singing app! But to listen to yourself sing costs real money most of the time.. And when I sing the voice isn't always clear.",
            "This is so much fun!!! I cant sang! But I'm having a ball trying ü§£ü§£ü§™. The only thing is for a person who's not on here a lot and singing for fun $19.99 is a lot to be asking for to have access to popular songs..üò©ü§î. But truly I'm excited about this app! Needs a $5.99 or even $9.99 what I pay for iMusic but have unlimited access to. Something to think about.",
            "I love this cuz I can like I can sing songs do whatever I want I can sing so many songs you should download this it doesn't had that it doesn't even have those many ads you should download it you really should so I'm telling you you should really download it."

It also gets through your photo's. Don't you realize, My Talking Angela, Talking Angel, Talking Ginger & all the other cats are by the same creator? Do NOT download this app for your own safety (confirmed by laurenzside, police & other youtubers)",
            "A best game than My Talking Tom and My Talking ben and My Talking hank and it is really different than others and i have seen first time a super cat like a funny star and the game is really funny the cat My Taking {GINGER} and Ginger really likes sun flowers i think because there is a puzzle of it and shower is also it. I LIKE IT...<>",
            "So the reason why I gave it 1 star because when I was doing the puzzle afterwards I saw man with a white mask or something kids do NOT download nor even get near it, it records your voice,your conversation,etc this is NOT a joke Don't download it",
            "Okay I buy this when I was nine and right when I got in it I freeked out I saw a man with a thing on his mouth I did play this I was not scared first i read the comments about this game...But Im vary dumb kids do not buy it.My legs shaked when I saw his eyes 0-0 Just do not buy this game pls!!‚ô•",

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groupsüò°üò°üò°üò°",
            "Each update is worse than last one, i have always one fake notification in app that not goes away until i force stop the app,why loadimg messages and chats take so much time?",
            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option. Thank you beforehand for such a great work!"

            "This game has a lot of potential but after a while it gets quite boring. Don't you think that when you have the buttons with the stripes an the arrows that if you merge them together you could clear the board or some type of explosion that adds points to your score. Come on people use your imagination we all have one. If I come up with something as simple as the explosions with the straight buttons I'm sure you could come up with something a lot better since you're supposed to be the experts",
            "I've always enjoyed this type of connect games and, to me, this is probably the best one out there. You can spin a wheel once a day for free to win bombs, scissors, ect. to help if needed. Youcan use gems to buy spins and it's very easy to get gems. There's no limit to how many times you can spin the wheel as long as you have gems which is great!Some levels are difficult but you can always get extra time if you watch a 5 to 30 second ad. Try it. It's a great game!",
            "My \"go to\" game for winding down and chilling out. Rarely do I find myself frustrated, and the ads are tolerable and, quite often, convenient! My teenager laughs at my longevity/commitment.....Level 1141 and climbing! There's just so many spots waiting to be connected!!! ...................... Side note: I usually keep my volume off while I play, but sometimes I thoroughly enjoy listening to the spots ‚òÜ \"PoP\"!‚òÜ when connected........and the fireworks! ü§£ü§≠ü§ì",
            "I don't like that you run out of gems so fast and that you only get 2 free ones when u watch an ad its just to much work to keep pressing the button and watching ads over and over again just for two gems.. I think we should get more gems and more time on the clock.",
            "Please help! When playing a game, after a few minutes, everything freezes and can't make anymore moves.... do i perhaps need to do an update or something? Love the game and don't want to start from the beginning again. All help will be appreciated Thank you."

            "Fun Game, Too Many Ads. Finished a level? Watch an ad. Don't want an ad? Here's one anyway. Here's another ad, I didn't skip the last one fast enough. Way too much. I timed it and for every 2 minutes of actual gameplay, I had 3 minutes 48 seconds of total ads",
            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

Speech Therapy: M is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say M and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice M with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say M correctly in the word \"mask\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices M by saying \"more\" while playing blocks, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say M\r\n~Tips on how to teach M to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online M flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying M\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on M for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying M!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

Beside this, I can't even add my son as a family member because I'm using romanian letters on my contacts (stupid, right?) and this app can't recognise him as a contact LE After the last update, this app is much, much worst. Won't follow the person on the move, completely stupid screen splitting between the map and info contact and, most often than before, contacts are offline when in fact they are"

        "description": "Speech Therapy: D\r\nIs your child working on saying D correctly? If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: D is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say D and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice D with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nThis app will help reach this goal! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say D correctly in the word \"donkey\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices D by saying \"draw\" while coloring, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say D\r\n~Guide on how to teach D to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online D flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach D to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying D\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on D for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying D!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

Not worth the time, uninstalled...",
            "The game itself is okay, but about 1/3rd of the videos either get stuck on a screen that wont close, or auto opens the play store. The game cant continue so it crashes or has to restart. When that happens you loose all the buffs that were boosting progress & much worse the gems on the build bar timeline. Until that gets fixed I'll play something else that doesnt make me feel like im getting screwed while wasting time making U money.",

            "Honestly just an ad bait. Even if you decide not to take them up on one of the 5p offers they have to reward you for watching an add, they'll just force one on you. Not unique game concept. It's kinda cool to watch them build, but it's too slow to actually be entertaining unless you watch 50 ads every 10 minutes. Wouldnt recomend if you value your time, but if you enjoy watching ads then its a pretty good game for you"

        "description": "Speech Therapy S\r\n\r\nSpeech Therapy: S is a comprehensive app which will allow you, the parent, to work on S with your child in the comfort of your own home. Everything you need to help your child say S correctly starting today is included in this app!\r\n\r\nHow it Works:\r\nThis app is very different than any other app you will find on the market. It is NOT just a simple game where a child practices saying sounds while naming pictures. Instead, this app is a tutorial. You, the parent, will first learn how to say S and then how to teach and cue your child to say S correctly. Next, we walk you through how to systematically practice S at the syllable, word, sentence, and conversational level. We provide game ideas, flashcards, and explanations of what you are doing and why. \r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say S correctly in the word \"snake\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices S by saying \"yes\" while eating at the dinner table, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say S\r\n~Tips on how to teach S to your child\r\n~The difference between lateral and frontal lisps and how this affects practice\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say S and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues on how to help your child say S\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Syllable level practice guide\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Photo Flashcards\r\n~And more!\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect: \r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child.

        "descriptionHTML": "<b>Speech Therapy S</b><br><br>Speech Therapy: S is a comprehensive app which will allow you, the parent, to work on S with your child in the comfort of your own home. Everything you need to help your child say S correctly starting today is included in this app!<br><br><b>How it Works:</b><br>This app is very different than any other app you will find on the market. It is NOT just a simple game where a child practices saying sounds while naming pictures. Instead, this app is a tutorial. You, the parent, will first learn how to say S and then how to teach and cue your child to say S correctly. Next, we walk you through how to systematically practice S at the syllable, word, sentence, and conversational level. We provide game ideas, flashcards, and explanations of what you are doing and why. <br><br>This app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. <br><br>I was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. <br><br>So, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! <br><br>In order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say S correctly in the word &quot;snake&quot; while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won&#39;t say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....<br><br>On the other hand, if a child practices S by saying &quot;yes&quot; while eating at the dinner table, carryover of progress is likely to happen!<br><br>This articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!<br><br><b>What&#39;s Included:</b><br>~Explanation on how to say S<br>~Tips on how to teach S to your child<br>~The difference between lateral and frontal lisps and how this affects practice<br>~A video showing exactly how to say S and explaining common errors<br>~A variety of cues on how to help your child say S<br>~Picture Flashcards<br>~Syllable level practice guide<br>~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level<br>~Photo Flashcards<br>~And more!<br><br><b>What you can expect: </b><br>This app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! <br><br><b>Who should use this app:</b><br>~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying S<br>~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover<br>~Children who have been working on S for a long time!<br>~Children who don&#39;t qualify for speech services for S even though they have trouble saying the sound!<br>~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips<br><br><b>Who made this app:</b><br>This app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist.

If it's possible, I can't find it. :( Edit: I deleted the app. It kept freezing up, there was no intuitive way to adjust the font style or size, & it would sometimes just go dark.

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: Z is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say Z and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice Z with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say Z correctly in the word \"zigzag\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices Z by saying \"zip\" every time a child zips a coat, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say Z\r\n~Guide on how to teach Z to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online Z flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app. You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach Z to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying Z\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on Z for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying Z\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

            "blurry external wallpaper while locked - I want an option for my Razr to have no blur while in peak view. At least let me control how much blur there is. Two weeks ago it was fine, but now it's like we turned the background blur from 30 to 100. I have been trying to fix it for the last six hours. üò≠ Who can I send screenshots to in order to collaborate a fix?",
            "My Razr's Peek Display Clock and notification icons are a clouded mess. For some reason, the exterior display wallpaper is constantly bleeding through Peek Views display. I have to end up making the wallpaper only black to see Peek View correctly, otherwise it looks like a blurry wallpaper covered by the clock instead of just displaying the Clock and Notification icons.",
            "After last update, making calls with the phone closed through the contacts shortcut swiping left just stopped working. When clicking the contact there's a message saying \"app isn't installed\", please help me have this back as I use it too much",
            "After the last update (Jul 2, 2020), messages like \"finger print not recognized\" have been shown too close to the clock. And why was the blue arc around notifications removed? And is it my impression or the blue arc around the clock is in a different color? Why? It's not big dea, but if you're going to change such a thing, you should, at least, permit us to change the color (to green, pink or anything else)",
            "Dialling emergency numbers when in pocket and incorrect unlock Pattern ERRORS I think this happens when the clock shows when in your pocket and you accidentally do a swipe maybe brushing your leg. this brings up the pattern unlock and also the emergency calls screen dialler. i get this often and its very annoying. Perhaps add an option into moto screen peek that fingerprint locking DISABLES IT and power button lock ALLOWS peek notifications and clock.  This would be awesome. Please"
