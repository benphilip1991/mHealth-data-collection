            "Versatile and helpful, this app packs almost all the features that I need, plus several unfamiliar exercises which, nonetheless, are easy to do and quite effective. I am guilty of leaving it unused on my phone for a while, but now that I have started using it daily (max efficiency, 500XP mode), I feel like there's some improvement already in a week or so.",
            "To the developers, Nice app. Really helpful. Just a few things I'd like you to look into: 1. There is no pause button during workouts. And if BACK, HOME or lock by mistake, and then return, the 1 min timer gets restarted. Some workouts don't work properly altogether after this problem. 2. To activate any plan, we need to click on the SETTING button. However, the SETTING button of the DRY EYE PLAN is not working properly.",
            "Love the exercises. Unfortunately the Learn part doesnt seem to work properly. Visual acuity gets stuck displaying an object or letter (no questions or feedback) , Eye quiz and Accomodation say to swipe for next question but nothing happens when I do that. Kaleidoscope feature works. I remember these features working. I have a huawei p20 lite with android 9",
            "I wish the exercises reflected realistic daily routines. I wake at 5am normally, and 10a-3p is more late morning/afternoon. Broaden the time restrictions on the compiled exercises, please. I would be inclined to use the app way more.",
            "the exercises are nice and well put together. However, I can't judge their effectivness as the app \"reminders\" don't work, so I often forget to do the exercises on time. If it gets fixed, not only will I give it 5 stars, but will look into buying some of the plans."

            "I can definitely see the difference in tint of my screen when the filter is on and I like the notification bar widget that lets you control whether the filter is active with a single tap. It also only requires two permissions to draw over other apps and the OS to keep the whole screen changed and it's easy to schedule it to turn on. Although, the filter stops working after awhile and I'm not even sure if the schedule works or not.",
            "Easy to use and toggle. Unlike other apps I've tried, it has the option to keep the on and off option at the top of the notification area so it is always accessible. I also like that it supports more than one intensity of overlay; having options is much nicer than not having options.",
            "Was the best night light filter out there but since I updated to Android 11 it bugs every time I watch a video on full-screen (the filter only covers a square in the center of the screen while two big sides of the screen so not have the filter). Other than that it works well. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars. Also, don't push premium on me every time I turn on the app, allow users to choose \"no, thank you\" instead of \"later\".",
            "Honestly, this is really a good app which helps us prevent the exposure of blue light of the screen for better eye health. But, sometimes all of sudden it stops working, especially when I open some apps like sticky notes, YouTube, VPN, etc, so I have to open this app and turn it on again. Rather inconvenience sometimes. I hope there will be some improvement about it. Thanks in advance :)",
            "Some bugs, like occasional it stops working, and when setting up a new filter it will revert to full brightness during the set up, but potentially this could be one of the best blue filter programs I've tried. I have light or medium on during the day and dark at night. It would be nice to be able to set up a schedule for this. You can set up your own filters too, or adjust the pre-sets to get it how you want it."

            "My eyes were very dry and tired from reading my computer screen and after just one session of exercise immediately felt 100% better. Great app! Why didn't we know about this all the rest of our life?!",
            "I've had this app on my phone a year now and enjoy using it very much. I find the exercises quite useful and relaxing as I'm on the computer roughly 12-to-16 hours daily at home. It has reduced eye fatigue and improved my vision significantly. A very useful tool with adjustable schedule and exercises for multiple daily use. I highly recommend it.",
            "Very useful! I'm someone who's been to a few eye doctors and this feels right.",
            "When I relax myself and read the instructions and then do it. My eyes fell refreshed. This may not work for everyone. But I noticed that while looking at my devices I very seldom blink my eyes or move my eyes around, I just steady stare. But this APP needs to give me an option choice, if I want a pop-up to remind me to exercise my eyes. And then let me automatically return to what I was doing.",
            "Even though some comments says that we can't read what is written while you're exercisesing it vibrates I tried it the first time and I love. 5 star💗💗 I feel refreshed every time I use this application"

Don't waste ur time by installing this app.",
            "I find it very helpful especially for my children as they can't memorize the letters! Unlike the usual eye test charts and you can put in the distance you are able to see and hold the phone at this distance which is more realistic. I struggle to get them to look at the eye charts and they like screens though I don't like them using screens! Very useful tool though.",
            "it's great, except, once or twice the icon that indicates which eye to cover didn't switch, although the result was given as though it. had. further, i was expecting greater variety in font size, once I'd hit \"nothing\", a few times.... i cannot comment on acuity, at present. it's potentially useful, but for now, not yet worthy of storage space.",
            "I'm not sure ? I tried all of the images. Each one gave a different result. Mostly in my left eye. My right eye was also different but much closer to the same range. The instructions are simple. So I'm not sure what to rate it at. I'm going to try again using the same imagine each time.adding to my review, 2 weeks down the road. I've kept taking my eye exams . I stuck with the same symbols each time. I believe it to be more accurate this way. I'm giving 4 stars after truly trying it out!"

These tests only mean to give you an idea whether or not you should see an eye doctor or go on an eye therapy.\r\n\r\nVISUAL ACUITY\r\nThe visual acuity test is a routine part of an eye examination, particularly in case of vision problems. At a young age, these vision problems can often be corrected or improved. Undetected or untreated vision problems can lead to permanent vision damage.\r\n\r\nCOLOR BLINDNESS\r\nTest if your color blind or not.\r\n\r\nAMSLER GRID\r\nThe Amsler grid is a grid of horizontal and vertical lines used to check vision problems caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula as well as the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nAMD\r\nAge-related macular degeneration is a progressing eye condition that affects millions of people.\r\n\r\nGLAUCOMA\r\nGlaucoma is a group of diseases that damage the eye’s optic nerve and can result in vision loss. If left untreated, It can lead to blindness.\r\n\r\nCONTRAST SENSITIVITY\r\nA contrast sensitivity test checks for the ability to differentiate between light and dark.\r\n\r\nLANDOLT C\r\nThe Landolt C is the standard optotype for acuity measurement in most European countries.\r\n\r\nTUMBLING E\r\nThis test is the standard visual acuity test for people who cannot read the Roman alphabet.\r\n\r\nASTIGMATISM\r\nAstigmatism is a vision condition that causes blurred vision making it difficult to see fine details, either close up or from a distance.\r\n\r\nDUOCHROME TEST\r\nThis test is used to estimate whether you are long or short sighted.\r\n\r\nOKN STRIP TEST\r\nAn official test to test your vision for specific eye problems.\r\n\r\nRED DESATURATION\r\nThe optic nerve is sensitive to red, so when it is damaged, red-colored objects may appear dull, washed-out or faded.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to do if I get bad results?\r\n\r\nIf your results indicate you may have vision problems, you should see an eye doctor. Having regular eye examinations promotes eye health. It also allows your doctor to measure your vision and make the necessary changes to your prescriptions.\r\nYou can also download eye training apps to preserve your eye sight and improve vision. You should take better care of your eyes and vision. Preserving vision health is one of our most important thing to do. Omitting eye care and eye exams can result in serious vision damage.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any eye problems using the web browser, to-do apps, calendars, writing messages or checking the phone book or the call log, you should take this test to check if you need eye treatment and/or vision training.\r\n\r\nNight vision improves night vision, it also improves night vision, this visual acuity test improves your visual acuity and your night vision.",

So if your left eye is better, you can remember the sequence first, then use you memory to see better same characters for right eye. Also it gives very different scores for different test. Overall considering so many design flows I do not recommend using this app at all.",

            "Fairly accurate except the test to see if your glasses are right for you. It said my glasses were not right for me. I tried the regular test with glasses on and had 100% vision in both eyes which tell me me my glasses are the right strength. Also the test to see if you have a stigmatism isn't right. It said I have a stigmatism in both eyes and my Son got the same result when he has 20/10 vision which is even better than 20/20 vision!"

            "This is a very helpful app. It is extremely useful. It keeps me on track with my schedule so I can place my eye drops on time. Thank you for creating such an amazing app.",
            "What could I do without this great app! Kudos to the developer! Thank you so much! Very simple, intuitive and the best app. Only thing that I would suggest changing is the possibility of setting regular ringtones, otherwise short one-time alarm tone sometimes is not enough. Good luck!",
            "This app is great to help keep one on schedule for using the right drops at the right time. Shows the color of the bottle cap of the drop to be used at each time and sounds a gentle chime as a reminder.",
            "Everything is nice. But we want some help in changing the alarm tone. In our case the tone seems like very short, it may not hear sometimes"

It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment for adults over 50 years. Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to pass this test a couple of times each year no matter what your age is.\r\n\r\nThe amsler grid used in this examination is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula (e.g. macular degeneration, Epiretinal membrane), as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain. A particular problem is the age-related macular degeneration.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is made with the best of intentions. The intuitive and flawless design allows you to navigate easily through the application. The voice guidance is provided during the test so that you don't need to move your mobile device near or far to read the instructions but instead you can hear the nice voice guiding you through different steps and actions. The voice can easily be muted and unmuted.\r\n\r\nIn the test, you will be given a small dot in the center of the grid. One should identify if any of the straight lines are wavy, missing or have other disorder. At the end of the test results will show whether the person has problems in central visual field or not for each eye separately.\r\n\r\nMore details about central visual field, macular degeneration, retina, eye examination tests and trainings as well as other eye related topics can be found in our news.eyeexamtest.com blog.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is continuously under improvement so your feedback is appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\n- Take the most comfortable position to relax.\r\n- Have a mild nature light and no glare on the phone screen.\r\n- Wear your contacts or glasses if you normally do.\r\n- Place your phone approx. 50 cm/20 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Cover one eye at a time with your hand.\r\n- Stare at the dot in the center. Do not let your eye drift from the center dot.\r\n- Try to identify if any of the straight lines appear wavy or bent,\r\n- Any of the boxes differ in size or shape from the others, or\r\n- Any of the lines are missing, blurry or discolored.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Languages:\r\n\r\n- English\r\n- Russian\r\n\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO:\r\nWe highly recommend using our Eye Care Plus that allows to pass a more detailed eye examination as well as train your eye muscles for better vision.\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyeexamtest.eyecareplus\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nThis application is not intended to replace optician's regular full examination.

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

Find out if you are at higher risk for eye diseases.\r\nBe aware of your family's health history. Do you or any of your family suffer from diabetes or have a history of high blood pressure?

Have regular physical exams to check for diabetes and high blood pressure.\r\nIf left untreated, these diseases can cause eye problems. In particular, diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to vision loss from diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and eye strokes.\r\n\r\n3. Look for warning signs of changes in your vision.\r\nIf you start noticing changes in your vision, see your eye doctor immediately. Some trouble signs to look for are double vision, hazy vision and difficulty seeing in low light conditions.\r\n\r\nOther signs and symptoms of potentially serious eye problems that warrant immediate attention include red eyes, frequent flashes of light, floaters, and eye pain and swelling.\r\n\r\n4.

            "The free version, with all the \"good stuff\" locked behind a paywall, is a demo. If you want the full game, then just like any other gaming platform, you have to pay. Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "I purchased a year subscription a couple months ago. It was great now in this last week it has so many glitches and each item doesn't want to open takes forever! And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "2 things happened to me. First is when I started playing on a different device, I came back to this one and all my stuff is gone, also when I purchased gold, the money went out but the gold never came, I've restarted the app, I even did the purchase 3 more times, all three times it withdrew but never gave me the gold, and now with all of my tanks and everything gone. I don't even want to play the game anymore",
            "This is the game where graphics and themes are awesome but same time their technical staff area is worst . They will keep sending you apologies ,give you some gold ,medals etc but they won't be able to restore your credits . Don't know if opponent use cheat codes or not . You will lost around 10k + credits , in a single match and that to the lower opponents . I have send them so many emails but till date they haven't resolved this issue .",
            "2 main issues, the new update doesn't allow the \"collect x amount of supply crates\" mission to work meaning I'm missing out on gold, and there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of silver earned from supply crates, making it much harder to level up tanks. Also, not sure what they mean by \"in game prices are now lower\" as I've seen no change in prices whatsoever. Tank upgrades still show the same price as before and buying anything for gold or money is still the same price.",
            "Great game so far easy to level up good game play great graphics events don't overwhelm you with the need to keep up pvp is optional it has plenty of options for strategy play challenging goals down side is it needs more content it has a place that said (coming soon) it has been some time and it has not been filled perhaps the devs need to install an alliance option in that spot with a leader board come on guys you have done this good keep going",
            "Great game, 1 problem I met though on my Huawey P9: Phone's display doesn't fit the entire game display, mostly the right side, therefore I cannot tap on the right arrow in \"depot - Blueprints\". I gwess this can be fixed by adding a display size option in settings wich I didn't see."

It&#39;s the same Fruit Ninja you know and love, but with gorgeous new visuals and tech! Slice fruit like never before in glorious high definition!<br><br>With this remake, we also have big plans for future updates that just weren&#39;t possible before. Stay tuned!",
        "comments": [
            "What the HELL is this new update? I thought this game was one of the few that weren't THAT outright money hungry, but now you removed the powers from all the blades and dojos I got from YEARS of hard work playing this game, just to introduce gems and loot boxes? The looks improved amazingly, they were truly outdated, but for the 10th anniversary instead of new exciting features you implement LOOT BOXES, HALFBRICK? You guys need help. Uninstalling and boycotting this everywhere I can.",
            "This used to be the height of childhood gameplay. The graphics USED to be fabulous, the menus USED to be well set up and intuitive, the missions USED to be fun. In other words, Fruit Ninja has been sllwly sinking lower and lower, and the recent 10th Anniversary Update has made it hit rock bottom.",
            "Gameplay wise the game is very fun. However one thing I've noticed in the new update is that you need to open loot boxes to get certain blades when all the blades used to use the level system. There shouldn't be a paywall for blades you once could unlock by playing normally in a previous update. Also this app stutters quite a lot and my phone usually handles games decently. For reference I'm using a samsung a20 for my device.",
            "Fruit ninja has always been one of my favourite games since the past so many years. Even my kids enjoy playing it. Two days back it got updated automatically. Shows upcoming additions. My only glitch is the new music when fruits arw cut. Can we have the old one back. This is not 'music to ears' as was the earlier one. Its disturbing and irritating, not in the flow of the game. Sync is also way off. Not in sync with when fruits are cut.",
            "Not impressed with the 10th anniversary update. The blades and dojos all seem to be the same. Some missions aren't registering your points and you can't change the missions as in the past. I'll give it a few more days to see if anything changes. But if not, I'll be deleting"

            "It's great at first but it start to get really irritating when you can't do anything without paying or watching ads. The ads are incredibly long. When you end up watching them to get the extra shots, it still makes it impossible to move past. And tbh it backfires because eventually after a few attempts over days, you get fed up of the whole game and find something new to play. Not happy with it",
            "Some users are complaining about the bubbles, and how the useful colours don't show up until it's far too late to win. I've been playing this game for a very long time, and I can say with 100% certainty that this was not the case until the last few updates. Clearly the game is becoming more about the ad revenue. The events and races are also just messed up (some days they're there, and suddenly you open the game and it's no longer there). Point is, I'm too annoyed to continue with this nonsense.",
            "The app is not working properly . It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly. It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly then there come 3 options:- 1. Send feedback 2. Open app again 3. Close app . But now the problem is solved and I have completed almost 1600 levels. It's an excellent game to play . Please download this game",
            "Bubble Shooter is grt fun when yr bored & it is casual and reminds u of arcade machines back in the day. It does have annoying adds and it can hoax u when you watch a video for Bonus Shots. But overwise it is amaze! Good times playing it, but even if u played every day for a year you still wouldn't finish Level Mode, cuz it has litterally over 2000 levels! I'm not kidding, play it & see. The graphics are grt and they have decent contorls. Overall its a grt game, which is grt fun.",
            "This could be a great game. I am a very good player and in the first 20 levels (the easy ones) more than a 3rd of all bubbles could not be used becuz the color was blocked or so far up unreachable. And worse yet it gives you the same non useable color over n over n over again in row til you get to the last 10 shots then gives u a useable color too late to have any chance of winning. This is not a hard game at all. Is just rediculously unplayable."

            "This used to be my favorite game, now I downloaded it again and I'm just disappointed, there is no story mode, you can only go a limit in every round till you finish the mission , and where did the story's go , and the record breaking games, and what happend to competitions, and the super silly fun land with the rollercoaster, I'm just disappointed, I hope you can fix it and undo the last 10 updates, and go back to the original game, cuz this one sucks. Very sadly uninstalling.🥺😩",
            "Game is enjoyable but once you complete all the levels you can't progress further. Also there should be a proper character categorisation . There are only 3 types of characters; common ,rare and epic. But some characters can be found by special missions . So they should be categorised under legendary or exclusive . Further there should be new rooms and new powerups for minions.",
            "I have given up trying to play it. 5 updates later and still no resolution to my loading issues, and I see from other comments I am not alone. Shame as otherwise it was for me one of the best games. Edit: thank you for your answer but it still doesn't work. Not sure of my Player ID as I can't get into the game, after the initial video it gets stuck on downloading 0mb of 0mb 🤷🏽",
            "great game but wow ive had problems. they have this new update and now i cant play anymore it just says downloading. for a week. i contacted help got a ticket but no fix. and then years ago i played this spent a ton of money but my progress wasnt saved. now it says i should be able to get my current progress back thru fb but i have my doubts since I cant even get into the game at all. so great game but dont play. edit: weeks later and still nothing from help customer assistance. Edit: better now",
            "Honestly, im rating this game 4 stars, all the progress i made in the good ole days of Minion Rush in the Story Mode was lost, and i genuinly miss that satisfaction of passing levels and seeing that a new part of the lab gets made and unlocked by filling up the containers with jelly, honestly, its easier to get minions now compared to before and currency is WAY easier to obtain compared to before, all that its missing for me is that story mode it had before, but still, this is a great game!"

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

            "This freezes so often and the rewards, loots obtained in the battles are so less that it takes a lot longer to buy equipments. Plus the wait time for upgrading the tanks and its accessories is very long. The tanks are over-rated, thus, exorbitant. If there was any option of minus rating, I would rate it minus 10. The game developers should either improve it to meet the demands of its subscribers or the google play should completely ban boring games like this one.",
            "Fun game, however the only way to really advance is to buy the premium. At 8 bucks a week, get real. Same for buying packages, they want to get rich overnight. Need to learn that a million one dollar bills still makes a million dollars. Also, you don't always get credited with a kill. Needs to also be a way to communicate with others during battles. Enjoyed playing, but moving on.",
            "This was a great game for years, but with each upgrade it slowly got worse. Now it's a piggy bank for the privalaged.when it actually works. Whatever it gives you free , it takes from you in equal measure.the minute it crashes or freezes, I'm sorry but your game is unplayable. So if your a new player don't waste your time and effort. Because even if you pay to play it rarely works. They're not so quick to put the problem right for you,",
            "Decent battle game, but Devs need to improve battle matching. Many times the game matches you up with player ranks & tanks 2 sometimes 3 tiers above you -- difficult to compete with that. Also, the game has frequent sever/ connection issues as others have stated. The game selects the server automatically and does not show the option to change if it thinks one is better than another (should alow user to choose).",
            "While I enjoy the game play... I'm completely put off by the constant disconnect. Daily. Multiple times daily. Many times it just locks up and I have to quit the game. Guess what though... it still logs that you used energy to attempt your match. So, you lose that time. That's kind of a big deal for a game that uses three energy an entry. I've tried my home network and I have had the same disconnect issues as my mobile network."

            "I love this game so much! I only had it for a week and its already my favorite. I have a couple of things that could be fixed though. Usually when I get a friend and I check my friends list they are not there which can be annoying. Sometimes when you try to load into a multiplayer game the map randomly isn´t downlaoded and it kicks you out of the game which is annoying too. It would be really cool if there was a friend and clan chat when your not in game. But overall this is amazing. 5 stars.",
            "Very amazing game. This game is very simple. You basically hunt animals and eat them to level up (if your sensitive to blood there's none in this game). You can even raise a cute family! [Maximum family members is 6). You can also change your animal, and it won't loose your progress! You can change it to a fox, bear, cheetah, crocodile, etc! HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃!",
            "I love this game but could you help me get on multiplayer because when I go on multiplayer it kicks me out and says Error connection to server timed out and that happened for 2 years! And it happened for no reason. I could not fix it! And it's still happening! Has that ever happened to you? And when 1 day passes I can go on multiplayer but if I exit and try going back it does the same as I told you at the second sentence.",
            "It's hard to control the eagle with flying, otherwise the controls are pretty darn good. Though I do know my phone is somewhat small and it's hard to simulate flight. I do think they should (if possible) add more plant variation like with bushes in certain maps. Maybe an aquatic update too? As someone who used to play when there was 3 play able animals, it's awesome to see this game grow! Sorry if I set my expectations too high or low, I just want to see the game improve for everyone.",
            "I love it, it is such a great game I have so much playing with outher players and by my self. But, there is some lag if you go on top of the land a little bit behind the poltel you can go throught that bit of land, be stuck there and have to tellport to your den. Beside that it is a great game. (In the clacis one.)"

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "SO good! I got this game not knowing anything about it. And when i started! It was amazing! I got controller compatability wich is really fun and is neat. Overall good graphics and addicting. You dont need to spend money on the game unless you are willing to support the developers. And there is barely any ads! (Besides ad rewards) im new and got some new cars!",
            "Good graphic, good control, best racing game so far. -1 star is the introduce of touchdrive auto drive which takes away players excitement although you have an option to manual steer but it became unfair since others just touchdrive. That's the only down side for this version. Update- uninstalled, seems like there's bug or virus that mess up with my phone. First came out ads issue, then cause my phone can't charge. Nearly goes into store to warranty my phone..",
            "One of the best arcade racer in the market. I'm having fun with this game on smart phone even more than arcade racers on pc. Just remember it's a game that relies on sales to keep it going, so be patient and don't go on a shopping spree without caring, cuz you can get a lot without spending much. And don't spend on any cars from classes higher than the ones from your current career. If you're in chapter 1 or 2, don't throw your money on S class cars. Each thing in is own time.",
            "The game was fine for the first few days but after that the game just crashes whatever I am doing in about 1 minutes time. Gameloft please do something about it or please tell me a way to troubleshoot this. If this wasn't a problem then the game is fantastic PS: I have a new phone and it can't be the problem on my device",
            "Ever since the last update, there's an advertisement that never loads and is just stuck. I can't even hit the back button. I have to close the app and go back in. It happens on my husband's phone as well, so it's not just me. I can't claim packs and use it to skip gas refilling. I just finally started spending my money on this game, and now it's giving me problems. Fix this issue and it'll be 5 stars from me"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "The game is quiet fun, but my first impression of the game was that it was slow. Within the first hour of playing, I got bored. An \"optional\" increase in speed (×2) could be good. People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

            "its the best game ever. there are loads of guns and grenades, i think for each match you should get at least one credit, you can play forever . there are 3 game modes and each month the theme including the 3rd game changes .the good thing is that they show you how many minutes the game is so thats why i put 5 star rating. its the best game you could ever play in your life.",
            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "I have loved this game and the play. But in the recent update and event, this has been a monumental failure. The new ranking system of pvp makes it more complicated to play with clan mates and it hasn't done anything to improve matchups. The new horde event with the collecting cards to gather coins to spend on weapons, heroes, and gear is just so complicated and frustrating. Why change something that worked for so long? The old way of milestones is so much better. Please go back to the old ways!",
            "Still a problem with PVP match ups!!!! Still too many cheaters, hackers and aim bots. And the match up algorithm is still a joke. Keep having to go against players with way more power. If you're on a win streak, magically you're going to have to face said cheaters, hackers and aim bots to knock your ranking back down. Been playing for almost 2 years and they still won't really fix this problem. I have too much money invested in this game to delete it. Oh well. Be warned.",
            "The new matchmaking system is just as terrible as the one before it. I have been playing the PVP since they introduced it and I have not gone beyond ranking 19 as I am constantly matched up against opponents far better than me, so nothing has changed besides the developers saying they have addressed an issue that so many gamers were unhappy with. And this new issue will take them years to sort out just like before. Steer clear of this game unless you are willing to spend lots of money.",
            "Great graphics good game except for the greedy pay to play system. This game also seem to have way too many server issues. Sometimes while I'm in the process of making a purchase it tells me I have been awarded the resources but it didn't actually happen. The devs will say it was added to my account when clearly it isn't. The match making system puts you up against players way more powerful than you are and you will often have to play against lame hackers that will not play fair.",
            "PVP is full of cheaters with hack codes, terrible system. Their servers lose connection nearly every day, multiple times, in the middle of a match causing you to lose. Extremely frustrating! If you love a game that the developers aim to beg for your wallet to get anything good to compete, well this game is for you!"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

If not, you might want to skip this app! If it were'nt for all the ads, I'd give the game 5 stars.",
            "Overall the game is good, but dis game is also an ad vector, so it wont stop giving you ads after everytimw u completed a course, even worse its a 15 second ad, can you shorten the ad by removing vungle ads they suck at making ads, i would rate it 5 stars if it werent for ads, and i developed a secret technique: Just disable wifi and mobile data so it wont give you ad now i dont need to pay to remove ad mwehehehehemwehehehehe u cant stop meeeeeeeee >:)",
            "Absolutely amazing and addictive game. I love playing this, but there is one small problem. The thing is that the levels are very hard so if hutch could just make the levels a bit more easier that would be great! The controls and the gameplay is awesome. Overall I LIKE THIS!!",
            "I really like this game. Its interesting to play. But I have problem when I try to do challenges it works perfectly fine. But when connection is lost. At the end of the race it loses my 1st live and asks me to do the whole race again. Please fix it. So that I won't lose a single live. It happened to me 6th time and I lost all lives and have to pay gems to continue. Please fix it. Or I will delete this game. Thank You",
            "This game was fun at first, and I tried it again because of that, after giving it 3/5 stars. I was about to give it 4/5 stars when I reconsidered. The scam of this game is they give you difficult-to-control vehicles and make it nearly impossible to get anywhere without struggling against your machine to get upgrades. Nice work Mattel: Now everyone knows what Hot Wheels are good for. May you and your families Race Off the road, you strategically illiterate schmucks."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I loved the game at first I even made it to level 50. However, after months of playing the game investing my time and money it rebooted and made me start over from level 1. They took away my home and Sims family. I was so disappointed. They have since fixed this problem and returned my level and items. I love this game.",
            "Ok. I like this game. But one thing that i really don't like is that they don't notify us of new updates in the game. I would have to go to playstore everytime i suspect there's new updates. Sometimes i would have missed more than a week during an event before i update and i miss good products. So I really hope they would change that and notify us within the game. Otherwise i love it.",
            "I love the game but some things are still quite annoying in it, like the challenges, some are impossible to get unless you make use of real money to purchase sim cash. It think they should make the challenges quite easier to win reward becos some people can't always afford that. I am also hoping to see pets and cars in the game. By the way nice one EA and Maxis",
            "Quite good mobile adaptation of The Sims game. Enjoyable. -- Problem though: My Sim is female but Izzy designed male clothes for me on the first try, and still male on the second try. My starter Fashion Gems all wasted since females can't wear male clothes. Suggestions: 1) make Izzy able to detect the current Sim's gender or allow us to choose. 2) State the requirements of player's name so that we don't have to keep guessing why it gets rejected.",
            "Have all sims in collection. All great only complaint in this game is the loading and the none selling of items in storage.Be good if could add more sims. Over all great game. Am enjoying it. If the situations were resolved i would give a 5 stars. cheers.."

            "Nothing really works, unless it's a function that entails you giving them money. Never an issue, there! But, the biggest turn off for me is the PvP arena. There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

            "The game is really fun; in fact this is one of my favorite games in the app store. But ever since Pop Cap has forgotten about the game, many bugs have appeared over time. For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",
            "One ot the best games . One of the worst game. This game has had very very much potential. This game is not only meant of kids . This game is fir everyone. There is a lot of strategy. And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

            "I love and highly recommend this game, its the best. Ive been playing for years on many phones, and \"finished\" the game quite a while ago. I have earned every character, world, and upgrade possible, I still like to play but there's nothing left to play for. The global chalenges are ok but I have no more use for coins and gems. You should consider a major update or Temple Run 3. Btw, never had to pay to play.",
            "Nice game.. But most of the maps are locked and we need to purchase them with gems. I had previously installed this game and played the Lost Jungle map which was free then but now its locked now. The same maybe will happen again. It's Halloween season now and they have 3 new maps, but after this is over, it will not be available. This is a great disappointment. Also, sometimes it freezes and the loading icon when we start the game doesn't appear for little long time..",
            "Very good game. I am playing this game for months and this game is my favourate game. It is one of the best offline games. It has many places (maps) like sky summit,frozen shadows,lost jungle etc. due to I like it more than temple run,spirit run and temple run oz. My favourite maps are lost jungle and frozen shadows. This game is the best. It also gives the option for playing in Blazing sands for around 8 minutes. I am waiting for the next update. This game has the best controls. Thank you.",
            "This may seem silly to some but this game has helped greatly in one thing I fear a lot – heights. Sky Summit was one map which I used to dislike a lot coz of the open area around it. But I somehow used to force myself to play it. And m glad i did! I love the map and almost have gotten rid of my heights problems. It might be possible to rid it fully, but it has helped as i dont tense up everytime i run through the skeleton road (spooky summit) of the game. Love it a lot! Thanks! Keep it up!!❤❤",
            "Cool Game. But when I first got my new tablet, and when I sign in to my account from my old tablet, and when I tried to get all of my coins and gems and my profile from my old tablet back, it will not let me have them back. Then it kept on glitching and lagging. So how about you get your butt fixing this game, this instantly, immediately right now! 😤😡😠😠😠"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",
            "Each update is worse than last one, i have always one fake notification in app that not goes away until i force stop the app,why loadimg messages and chats take so much time?",
            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option. Thank you beforehand for such a great work!"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Overall, I think this is the best battle royale kind of game I could find and it's because there is no other which has the same resources as PUBG does, congrats on the game, keep the work up! As seen in other reviews, there is indeed a lot of hackers and it looks like your work at banning them is not that efficient, as there are still a lot that don't get banned",
            "I like this game very much but after latest update which was named 'new era' some problems start to happen. for example : location mark doesn't work well and after you mark a location if you rotate the camera it starts to move In addition, some of buttons of actions in game look very blurry. It seems that they have very low amount of quality",
            "Arena, why would you put me in a match when the match is almost done. That is not ok 0 kills 5 seconds into the match, match is over. That's Ludacris, Not cool at all. Give the option to uneqip grenades in arena. Could there be any easier way to upgrade all weapons without spending a fortune. This is not only a game , well maybe it is but it would be so much more enjoyable if one could just buy parts to upgrade instead of randomised luck. Please that would be great.",
            "This is 1 of my favorite games. 1 thing I would like to see is a map that is just 1 big city. With some 2-3-4-5 story buildings. That would be cool. This is a game that I would highly recommend it has good graphics and physics as well it is (mostly) balanced. It is a all around a vary good game. Also can you put the weapons and vehicles from payload 2.0 in the training and cheat park please.",
            "This is an amazing game. Too bad the developers are greedy and selfish. Every season the game gets worse with bugs. Nobody cares to sort out the problems but they expect us to keep using our money. Many modes have continuous problems and customer care will ask the same ridiculous things over and over but do nothing. The game is full of cheaters and hackers. Game is getting more pathetic by the day. Just waiting for another game like this to come out with better support."

The new update is ok, although I don't like the appearance of the toilets, bathtub and the pool, green makes it look like they're broken. Also can you fix the sound? Apparently everyone now has Tom's voice instead of their own voices.",
            "This game is so best and so cute. 😘😘. But the problem is add some more toys and the main problem is they sleep very quick and add more people. That's it to improve. I would like to appreciate this game. But sorry, I will give only 4 rating because you need to improve this game with more fun. So sorry but please do improve it. The game is so awesome. I liked this game👍👍👍",

Try this app now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "This app is great! Tom and his friends are soooo cute🤩 There are many surprises to discover and endless possibilities to do! The minigames are great(my favourite is sky skater) the only requests I want to have is 1. Make more toys in the treehouse 2. Make costumes more easy to find 3. There should be a makeup table ( we could also do it for the boys too and see how the girls would react to it) it's a great game though five stars!😄😄😄",
            "I have rated this game with 4 stars..because there should be many more features if you give some more things etc..would enjoy the game a lotttt..I liked it so much than other games. Appreciable. My wish is please add features like there should be makeup room for Angela etc.., changing dress for Tom, ginger etc..,and in the house there should be some more like all the six should play hide n seek etc..And one more can you add 3 to 4 people more😜plaese can you. N how 2 update there's n option"

            "Man, this game is one of the better free games on the Google Play Store! I remember when I was younger I'd play this game and from then to now the game feels a lot more polished and in my opinion is better then most games you have to pay for on the app store. It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",
            "New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",

All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

            "Your game has become pay to win. Before all you had to do was just play the game normally and not be killed by ridiculously over powered A.I's or players. But now that every single mobile game is pay to win, you have jumped on that same train which was a bad idea. I hope this gets my point and a lot of other people's points across to the developer because the game has just become annoying.",
            "Was more fun when it was offline. Now that there are other people online with you, there are ridiculously overpowered people who kill you about 3 seconds after spawn. Great for the people who have already gotten things like the kraken, super annoying for the people who are working their way up. My suggestion? Make it optional to be online. It's already hard enough for the people who have just begun with the game, please don't make it harder.",
            "The game was better before all the bells and whistles were added. I've played this game for years and years and I miss when the object of the game was just to get as big as possible. No in addition to surviving the in game enemies, you have to survive agressive other players with over powered sharks that make it nearly impossible to play as anything smaller than a great white. I hope this is a temporary update because I for one am not a fan. This didn't used to be a stressful game",
            "This game is horrible. You will constantly be killed by enemy sharks you cannot kill (literally impossible for 50% of sharks. Sharks that can kill it will take months to get) within 30seconds of starting a game. These unkillable sharks will come from anywhere and they are everywhere. Do not waste your time on this game.",
            "After spending more time with this game I am updating my rating. At first this game is really fun. You swim around eating most things in sight, sating your hunger. You quickly learn that there are some things you just can't eat and pose a risk to you. There are cool secrets and stuff everywhere to find. However it's not long before your progress begins slowing down to a grind. The risks grow and the rewards shrink. You find yourself being one-shot by pay-to-win player sharks or stuff off-screen."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

Also please remove some of the ads for better 👍",

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "This is a great app the only complaint is you can't make your own pin and play with other friends cuz when you type student it won't let me lion and when I try to enter the pin like I make a pin and it just won't let me play it because they did some research the PIN well the rest of the game is fun but I am I always need to get another device so so I can play in the rest of the game is pretty fun that's why I'm giving you five stars your games are pretty good keep up the good work I play this .",
            "I tried making a quiz and was really enjoyable. I also played a few quizzes and is amazing of how easy it is to log on or sign up. In my opinion, this game is amazing. My favourite part is making the quizzes. Great game.",
            "I had to take a star off because its laggy with the button pressing, had to double press a few times which made me lose all the time. Other than that, awesome idea!",
            "Quick to make a game but I don't know why you have to pay premium for a literal slide. Good for joining games, not good for makeing games."

Glitch the game: play in laptop go to watch a video of how to glitch the game of red ball 1234 then bingo done.",
            "Its amazing, it had good gameplay, good looks and its very challenging, fun game, it gets a 5/5 tho i got an idea, in the underground/cave levels there should be shards with random colors, when your underneath them they shake for 1 second then fall, there will be 3 colors, green with a speed od 0.3 pink with a speed of 0.9 and yellow with a speed of 3, and can you add a level maker? That would be so cool!",
            "After having the free version of this game for quite a while, my son asked me to put down the massive $1.99 for the Android TV version of this game so he didn't have to wait to unlock lives. On the NVidia Shield w/ controller, this game is a blast for him. The paid version unlocked tons of fun worlds and levels. It's fun simple game play that reminded me a bit of Mario Brothers to be honest. Simple game play but still fun enough for both of us to enjoy. GREAT for kids!",
            "It is crazy how bad the controls are. I have lost all of my lives (all 5) on one part of one level in the first set of 15 because the controls won't respond to me and I am constantly falling off because I have too much speed for the controls to be able to stop after they finally wake up and realize that there is an input. The controls feel harder to use than how hard it is to herd cats.",
            "Very good game and it is also good for children and elders.......my daughter loves this game and when she feel tired or when she is bored she plays the game and she is very happy....one thing she doesn't like and that is the life issue because there are only five life's so when the hard level come and there were no life's she feel very sad.....now she is in 54 level ( fourth episode ) and her age is 11.......so i request to fix these issue and also if total 5 life's then reduce the timing....."

The only thing I wish they would fix is the loading time. and being able to join lower level players if they accepted a request to join the game. And the fact that you get so little coins and gems from winning a match if they fixed those two problems the game would be a lot more fun.",
            "Best fps ever.This game is just not shooting,it has racing, running , parkour and more!!!.Add more modes and i will be happier to play this,keep it up!!!!!👍👍👍👍and also while loading resources,you are suggesting a tip and really helped.Some weapons are really cheap!!!!.",
            "I always didn't like this game because of its super slow time to kill. It takes up to 3 headshots to kill someone with a sniper rifle. If the time to kill is raised I would definitely start playing this game more often but it just isn't very good. Take something like Call of Duty: Mobile, that game has a fair time to kill while this game has super long time to kill. Thats the only thing that's preventing it from being good and I'm sure everyone can agree on that. But everything else is perfect.",
            "Amazing game I've been playing for years. Best fps (first person shooter) the guns are creative. Although I preferred the choice of the many maps its still a great game. Could do some work on the campaign the last world is really hard. Other than those two things it's just the best game I've played in a while. So im having problems with the store working its saying \"no connection to store\" and its been doing it for a year now"

            "It is an amazing game and it is really relaxing. I was fully depressed last month when the exams came, for 2 days I played this and then it was just so smooth. In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "I have to go through the level finishing right at the start. Is this a joke to you? Whenever you hold to try and make the ball go down, you can only get to about 5 or 6 lines and then it just stops and tells you the level is completed. Please fix this. Incredible amounts of lag due to loading Advertisement and overall rubbish. This could do with less advertisement, more bug fixing and communicating. I think this app is lazy and unfinished so this is why I put 1 star. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!",
            "I give 4 star because I love this game sooooo much but there is one problem there is soo much ads, When I just Start play the ad will come. But whatever I just love this game!!! 💕",
            "This game is very easy and fun to play! I love this app I can never get off it. It's sooo amazing I can get different collective items every day and they look amazing! My favorite one is the bomb because it's super deadly in different ways. If you don't like this game then you are totally boring because this game is super fun! So if I were you I would go on play store, DOWNLOAD the app and give it 5 stars.",
            "I don't think so. I could take an ad after three or four levels, but after 2 is ridiculous. Plus, the game cheats. You are not touching the ad at all, you're just sitting there waiting for the \"X\" out, and before you can \"X\" out the app OPENS Google Play. That sucks and it's dishonest. I did not want to go to Google Play.",
            "Decent game, tend to enjoy it when I need to kill time. Only problem is the ads. The levels are long enough to not feel constantly bombarded by ads, and this game runs well if you disconnect from WiFi. In this game you can continue from where you lost if you watch a video. But if you say you don't want to continue, it will often play an ad anyway and not give you anything in return? Why play an ad if I just hit a button to not watch an ad and restart the level?"

I really like your game Pepi Wonder World.",

            "I remeber about 5 or so years ago this game was really differant, but don't take that the wrong way, the skins now are really cool and the map almost seems larger! The only thing I would change is to add back some of the old skins, because I thought they were fun and that way you would get more of a variety, because now there isnt as many skins as there used to be, and you have to play, ALOT to get some of the new skins, but this game is super cool and really addictive!",
            "Well, sadly, it used to be 5 stars and not loads of ads. I changed it to 3 stars after there were way too much ads and not only too much, there started to be gross, bloody, inmature ads that is not good for a kid to watch. I feel like now that I wrote a good 5 star review a few days ago about good ads, the developer thinks that I will be ok with the types of ads now. Its fine most of the time but I had to write a bad review after there was an ad that had bees stinging ladys and showing blood.",
            "This game is really good but I played it a few years ago and it was way better of course it's a good game but the skins a few years ago were better and didn't have to unlock them also I thought of was more free or something, I think that's just me though. This is a good game though and I love it ❣️",
            "I like this game . Its a wonderful game because while starting we will be small and while killing others and we will get longer and longer so I love this game .. so....…. Come on and download this game and start. Play but we cant able to play this game in online . But this is a good game to play. So… I like this game 🤗🤗🤗 and my high score is 14000. This was new. Game i was happy",
            "I love his very addictive fun exciting game, however I would of gave it a 5 if the ads where tuned down a bit, I mean too many ads and it would be better and more fun if there was only like 1 ad for 5 games, I would love it, but gotta say I love the new update.👉👈"

            "I love this app. The slimes realistic, and when you tap or drag the screen, the slime reacts as if it was a real slime. It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "Made it to level 142, time to uninstall cant get past the level. These games are suppose to be relaxing not so stressful you want to throw your phone across the room.",
            "Can't even get to second level before been bombarded with ads, and ads at bottom of screen. Yes I know ads bring revenue, but there is a balance, between people enjoying the game few ads and get some revenue, or bombarding people with ads and uninstall (like me) and get no revenue. Goodbye."

            "I like this game so much but after the Halloween update, it looks like it needs more data and I can't play a smooth game🙁 Sometimes when I earn so much coins, suddenly it will show like 'Talking Tom Hero Dash isn't responding'. And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",

            "So I loved this game and I paid for no ads, and got all the monsters. But yet I guess now that I'm towards the \"end\" I have to watch an ad to play. No problem but 1. I paid for no ads. None. And I can't watch the ad to play your game. It keeps saying there's no video available, try again later and freezes. So over all. Love the actual game and game play, but don't waste your money and be fully prepared to not be able to move forward in the game. I got to 77, I passed. I can't play the other 3.",
            "My daughter loved this game but since she got to level 61, she can't revive. If she does, the character moves but the screen doesn't move with her. She also is having a problem with the repair alphabet rooms. She's on room F, has done everything, but it won't reward her or unlock the next room. Gutting for a 6 year old. I think she's finished the game, she's just replaying some levels now.",
            "I love this game, but as soon as I tried to paint on room 2 everything froze, I tried turning my phone on and off, closing the game... nothing worked! It might of been a virus but I'm not sure, I loved this game so much and ended up having to uninstall it then reinstall. I have had to start ALL OVER AGAIN 😠😠😠 That is why I have to give it a three out of five, sorry! It is a really fun game though.",
            "I originally had this game on an Amazon tablet where the ads are contained. After upgrading my son's tablet to a more powerful android device I re-download this. This game is flooded with microtranaction and ads even after paying the 2 dollars to \"remove ads\". What this $2 doesn't include is the need to watch 30s ads for each level after level 16 everytime you play a lvl. This is false advertisement and dishonesty around paying $2 to \"remove ads\". DO NOT download for your kids. I want my $2 back",
            "I give this game a 1 out five because everytime I try to play the game it kicks me out I haven't evan got to see if the game was nice cause it kicks me out . I don't recommend this game for anyone, it just takes up space that you can use for another app that actually works!!.very bad quality, very bad game!!!!!!!!!"

            "It's a dorky 2 d game. But I love it. I play it with my kids. Also toooooooo many ads! I am annoyed to have to watch ads to earn coins to buy upgrades. There should be a way to earn enough through the game. What if I pay$ 3.99 for no ads? How will I earn coins and extra power in the tournaments? I hope the developers of this game get stomach cancer. You think that's harsh? Try literally wasting hours of your life watching all these ads.",
            "Game is great. I have no problem at all with the actual game, HOWEVER, the thing that brought this game down from what could have been a four or five star, was the ads. The moment you open the game, there is no way you won't see an ad. Win a battle? Watch an ad. Loose a battle? Watch an ad. And yes I get that you can spend money to remove ads but a lot of players are freebees, and that really narrows down where you are getting revinue from. Please do something about the ads.",
            "I like the game, but the ads make it unplayable. An ad after every two shots, often before and after every game, and randomly in the main page. Plus you have to watch an ad to actually receive any rewards from playing. I decided to purchase the overpriced ad removal to be able to actually enjoy the game. DO NOT DO THAT!! It does not actually remove all of the ads. You still have to watch an add after every single round just to receive any rewards. This game is not pay to win, its watch to win.",
            "the game is a lot of fun although there is a warning right now there is a lot of ads on this game I would recommend playing with the signal off for such as Wi-Fiso if you don't want to get rid of the fads do not play with Wi-Fi on although it is still a very fun gametank stars is the best game I've ever played that is why I rated 5-stars I would rate it 10 Stars if there was a such thing",
            "When I first played the game I was super happy! I loved the theme and the easy controls! I am not giving it 5 or 4 stars, though. First, sometimes when I got out of the game and then came back the game wouldn't work, and that's not all. The only way to play again correctly was to UNISTALL the game! WHAT THE HECK?! I lost all my progress more than THREE TIMES! Second, because I am not done, there are WAY TO MANY ADS! Every 1 to 2 minutes an ad appears! If it had less ads..."

            "The game was amazing, but a weird thing happened, I didnt open the app for a day or two. But when I opened it today the mission was different, the last time I opened it the mission was some sort of a car(Which is hard for me) but now its some red coins, when a game starts, it starts with a tsunami. Hmm so is that something bad?",
            "I used to LOVE playing this game... redownloaded after almost 3 years and it let me sync to my account but expects me to pay for the coin doubler again. And now it's $4.99 instead of the $1.99 or the 2.99 I paid for it. I'm pretty sure it was $1.99. Because I never spend more than that. But damn. Give me what I paid for... I mean if I repurchased it now I would have paid 1.5 times what it's worth maybe even a little more. Why can I get all my old stats but not things I purchased?!?",
            "I played this game since 2014 and it used to be fun. I would've given it 5 stars. I've recently downloaded it again. My problem is that I'm currently at level 13 and supposedly unlocked the +zombie upgrade. Yeah, it's unlocked, but it's still on a read-only function (grayish photo and description at the bottom, no \"buy\" button and price). Tried reopening the game, still unavailable. I really don't want to have to give up on this game. Hope you can fix it, thanks.",
            "It is a fine game. It is basic as an auto runner is. The catch is that you have an army of dumb zombies. When I mean dumb I mean that they fall mid jump. That is a challenge and not a bug (if it is, don't fix it devs). This would be a good game but I can't stick with the game. For one, the missions range from easy so luck based. The daily challenges are not enough to keep me interested and the gimmic is not (yet) fun. I grew tired of this and jumped to Jetpack Joyride because that is better.",
            "Loved this game. I totally recommend this game to everyone but it might get changed sometimes and all you have to do is restart the game and that's really annoying and when you do restart the game all your hard work goes down the drain I really hope this problem gets fixed"

            "It's a very good app, but the photo editing options are less. It would be very helpful if there more editing options especially in the colour option. Also, saving the pdf is taking a lot of time. If the time for saving is reduced it would be very helpful. Other than this, the app is great. I can smoothly share assignments using this app. There are no ads in this app which is great! Overall it's a good app but it could be made better by adding some more editing options.",
            "Good app. But this app tends to lag at times. Please make the generation of PDFs faster because it takes a lot of time and because of it, I could not submit my assessments on time. Though the copies were checked, but I had to listen to warnings from teachers. Please make the generation faster. Otherwise it is a very useful app and is handy too.🙂🙂🙂",
            "Finally we have a phone scanner that works about as well as a flat bed scanner! I've tried a few of these types of apps in the past, and they usually had issues. But this one seems to have hit the bulls eye on everything. The auto-detect borders almost always works, the adjustments are easy, the file size is reasonable, the touch-up/edit features work very well, and it doesn't erase your entire scan if your screen turns off because you had to step away for a second (like DropBox does). No complaints about this app so far!",
            "I'm using this to scan my answers to exam questions, then i make them pdf and send to my instructor. This is the best because I can select different filters for better look and legibility. When I pick a filter, I can shoot photos back to back without stopping and it will turn all of them to my selected filter. Also, it has auto-detection for documents. When I direct my camera to a document, it understands the context i dont even need to shoot or crop, it does everything by itself. Super useful",
            "my main issue with this app is that it cannot pick up each section of a certain document consistently, e.g I'll scan a document and half of it is very light and difficult to identify, while in reality it is just as dark as the other half of the page, though this may also be partially attributed to background lighting. nevertheless, this app simplifies processing and downloading scanned documents and for me, is more effective than a standard camera."

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

Now I am in a dispute to get my money back that should never had been taken. They suck and I actually rate them negative 10 stars !",

I suggest you to download this game only other than Temple Run 2 because it's has characters, power ups and more. It's less MB also. But I have given 4 stars it is not running smoothly. The characters are very expensive. Please less the rate. And the most annoying thing is the BIGGEST DEVIL- THE ADS !!!! 😈😈😈. They come after every run and I didn't like it at all. Please remove the Ads ! Please !!!",
            "I'm gave 4stars to this game. This game is very interesting and entertainment. When I'm was bored I was started to playing this game. The man is running we have to face the rivers, rocks and gaps. And we also to collect the coins on the way of running. We have also change the characters also but we have more money. I collect 5000coins for the 1st run I bought a one new character. But other characters we can't able to bought for coins. At last this is a very interesting game for kids below 13r14.",
            "It is a very nice game. The characters are wonderful. The scenary of the environment around is awesome. But one thing's very annoying,,,the ads!!! I want the ads removed. It's really very annoying. But if I forget about the ads,then I will say that it's a wonderful and mind-blowing game",
            "I clicked on the game, it takes ages to load and then the game just completely froze. And then it went off the game back onto my home screen. All I wanted to do was play the game but it kept on doing the same thing (freezing). I am very dissapointed as I was very excited to play this game as i haven't played it in a long long time.",
            "It's an awesome game !!! I Love this game very much. The character are wonderful. But there is one reason that i didn't give it 5 star. It's because of howmany ads. Overall, a great game."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "Best offline game I have ever played super cool except I just wanted to say... Pls make this tory mode a bit different cause it gets boring to drive the same track with the same st uff and all and also I would love if there was another way to earn money than just driving apart from that the game is cool! 👍😎",
            "This game is fun it helps to pass bye time and just fun in Jenerel but I wish that the price of things would be a bit lower I would recommend this game to people that love killing zombies and survival games this is why I would give this game a five star rating think you craters for making this game",
            "Was okay until I realized that it forced you to use a new vehicle when you unlock it. Good hour or two upgrading everything to pretty much be reset. No thanks.",
            "Awesome game id be so happy if you guys made like more levels,more vehicles,and new types of zombies or even chapters like the levels are episodes and there are chapters in the game"

            "It is a good game but has its quirks. The bone pile is hidden during play and only visible when you draw from it. If you're not careful and hold the piece while you're placing, it, it will go to the closest matching piece. When the game is over, it covers the board so you can't review the game. Scoring is puzzling, for instance; our team score was almost 8000 and overnight dropped more than 2000 points. There is no way to remove deadbeat or caustic players from the team.",
            "Love the game, the colors and play of the game is nice. but there is an error with this app...Whenever there is a draw, the computer automatically gives the round to the opponent/computer. Also, tap-to-play causes misplays. This app can be better by:. 1) Showing how many bones are left in the boneyard. 2) allowing online play with other humans. 3) making a 3-player, and 4-player option. 4) add a carribean style play mode, where you don't win by points but after a set number of games one.",
            "Needs updates bad! The boneyard play is awful. Whether it is in my favor or not, it is ridiculous how this one pull gets the exact domino needed for an advantage, it is frustrating when you strategize to send your opponent to the yard and for them to only pull one bone nearly everytime and it's usually the exact one needed. I would be here all week describing the scenarios that I've witnessed, but overall it seems like the game leans in favor of the player of it's choice. IJS",
            "Downloaded this game as something to help me wind down (and at first it was) but, with all the updates, it's turned into a constant source of frustration. The scripting is so obvious I can guess what domino the computer will play without even seeing their dominoes. This game has gone very downhill very quickly.",
            "I've been playing this for about a year and have begun to notice that there are about 8 - 10 games that continually repeat, it's like being in \"Groundhog Day.\" I didn't notice this at first, i thought it was random shuffling, but am seeing it more frequently for the last month or so... Today the game played first, starting with a 3x6 domino, then on its second play it played a double 6! Very frustrating! The game doesn't even follow its own rules, i.e., the first player starts play with..."

Made my eyes water up , I can't play anymore : good luck 🤗 And to all future players. If you see VGA:top or any other. Just leave. I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",
            "Love the game can't seem to put it down. No problems with my iPhone! The graphics on this game is amazing its clear not blurry like those othe war games. You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

            "usually i really love this app it's like 5-stars-worthy. it has everything you want, you can play lots of already 'composed' songs but you can also make your own which is really fun. but lately there's bin this bug that it doesn't play the notes of yellow and orange dots all at once although i presse them. it's just super annoying and i've had that problem several times already. pls fix it!",
            "I used to use this app years ago until they lost my account and do not respond to emails to recover all the songs I bought back then. I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",
            "You're Not Going to Learn How to Play Piano however it feels like you almost are playing an instrument. When I first played Magic Piano it turned out to be harder than it looks. As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",
            "This is an awesome game! It's just that it takes sooo long to unlock a song! The lowest price for songs is 25, and everytime we level up or complete an achievement, we only get 2 or 1! And it takes so long to level up or complete an achievement!"

This game is the best but I didn't do To well. But I'll be back for more, I promise. 'Just need a little break 😴. I'm Back! I got a little rest and I am ready to play some more, That's if okay with you ? 😕",
            "The speed at which stars are awarded vary a great deal. Also some times a bubble shoots when you are trying to change the bubble for another color. This is very unfair.",

            "It's okay, except the fact that it gives gifts like laser beams but in actual fact you dont have them and they don't reflect when you play."

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

Next one, back flips. I did several back flips & only one was counted. Did it again & still, only one had been counted. Repeated the process again & same result. Hope I have helped in some way to resolve the problem. Thank you & have a great day",
            "I started playing this years ago only because my friends were playing it in high school and I remembered it being really fun. Especially just trying to beat each others highscores and trying different cars to comeplete stages. Its so nice to see that the game still has so many downloads and still has its charm as it did back then. Addictive gameplay, smooth, simple but yet beautiful graphics (looks and feels good on a bigger screen device), fun progression and also completely free to play.",
            "This is a really nice game. But the idea of havingbto start from the beginning every time is really bad. There should be lives or check points. If you die,you start where you died. You can do this maybe only twice,then from there you have to start from the beginning again. Starting over n over makes me not wanna play anymore",
            "Great app with a great features there are. So much entertainment in it it is the one of the great feature of this game. This game is good no ads in it is also a good feature in the game new cars are good and improved . That is why I love the game there are new and entertaining paths and ways I like the game very much thee are no glitches in the game ( app. ) . This is also quite funny when the man sitting in the car dies this is a great app. I have a great experience.",
            "Overall i love this game. The graphics, and ease of play is relsly good. Ive been playing it for ages and i did get really far at one point until i lost all my data before saving it. Onky problem i have with this game is the amount of time it takes to save up the coins to upgrade and unlock things."

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",

            "Great game! It's definitely a puzzle game. It takes several tries to figure out how to beat each level. That's what I love about it! I paid the 2.99 to turn off the ads. Finally completed the last level. Took forever! Please add more levels! UPDATE: It's been a couple of months now since I finished the last level. Mind you, I don't know when the last level was actually completed by boom bit, but I keep getting updates for all of their games, but no new levels. Give us some new levels, man!",
            "The game is good, but very repetitive - just like the ads. You basically have to keep doing the same level over and over to earn enough coin to upgrade your car enough to pass that level. I paid to remove the ads as they were REALLY annoying. Even when you pay to remove the ads, you still get ads trying to get you to pay more money to unlock vehicles. I completed this game with the 2 cars that come by default within a few hours. Just waiting for new levels to be added. Not sure they will though.",
            "While my son I enjoyed playing the game, the ads can be a little bit ridiculous but I do understand it's a free game but still. I'm glad I didn't pay $299 for the no ads because there's not enough levels, with that said level 11 the vertical jump with the mountain yeah that can go to hell. I like a hard game but if I'm ready to throw the phone that's when I quit playing a game. only reason I will keep it is because my son likes playing it and he wants to unlock the rest of the free cars.",
            "Phenomenal Game but its very clear its unfinished. Level 11 is definitely meant to be a cash grab. Its 10 orders of magnitude more difficult than all the levels before it. Then level 12 is the final level. You can beat it over and over but the \"next level\" is always just the same level 12. Also, the ads are horrific!",
            "Heavy on ads, and level 11 designed to being in the revenue by being nearly impossible so you just watch a ton of ads or cough up the $$, but that doesn't solve how hard the level is. It also has some kind of memory leak that requires a hard close every so often. Otherwise it can generally be fun to play."

            "It is a very nice game. I am playing this game from a very long time , around 4 to 5 years , but now you have to pay for some customisation and for some fast cars which can only be bought through diamond . Please add more places other than city,airport ,port and off-road. There are two more modes, police chasing and another which always show coming soon . I've been waiting for those two new modes , please launch the other two modes soon.",
            "Brilliant game, love how easy it is to get cash. Just one thing though, everytime I try and resume theres an ad, could you make it like every 4 times you click resume or something. Also, some of the time trials and drift challenges are impossible to do in a normal car, like the 20,000 cash on on offroad with 31 checkpoints and 3 laps, you cant do that in 4 minutes, it's impossible without an offroad car which cost way too much. The 5,000 and 10,000 druft challenged on port are impossible too.",
            "It's been so long since I played this game and I'm so happy with how this game improved! I think I first played this game around 2015 maybe and I enjoyed it! Five years later and the graphics have improved and the game quality improved too. However, I don't like that there is now limited customization with the vehicles--nitro is one example--but I think I can pass on that. Another thing I hope to see in the future is more areas besides the airport, off-road, and the port.",
            "I have been playing this game for a very very long time now. During this time I have absolutely loved playing this game. However some minor issues ruin the best experience possible. Such as : at high speed my car will start bouncing on the road and ruin my speed records. I would really want this fixed. A cool feature would be a turbo sound ! In feed in the game the turbo only increases the speed of the car. However the sound of a turbo is always great to hear. Please add one.",
            "Actually a fairly decent game, few flaws though. The drifting challenges are very hard since they want you to learn how to drift while in a straight away..... still a really good game despite the few flaws it has. Also turn off wifi and data so you dont get ads, but the ads arent too bad if you want to keep it on. The driving does take some getting used to."

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "Everything is going well but their is some need to improve your server because we are facing so many problems related to high ping during the gameplay. Our character is ejected out to lobby again and again because of which we can't perform properly in battle royal. I hope you will take a quick decision to improve all of these problems which players are facing.",
            "Great game ever but it had a connection problem and more of bugs after this update please resolve it. And other thing is that we want to purchase diamonds there is no other way. And all of good characters are only of diamonds. I am of middle class family i do not have such money. Please solve it. Anyway its such a lovely game.I like it very much. THANK YOU.",
            "I rated it 5 star, because when I installed this this game is really nice because it's graphics. But nowadays there is many issues arised,one of them is the connection problem,I have really good internet connection but here always ping above 200,when I watching others game play when my character is dead,there is ping 78-90, but when I target a enemies at that point of time ping is converted into 250-350, .I saw damage on my screen and after few seconds, showing me that I'm dead..lol games.",
            "Overall it's one of the best game tru there. Superd gameplay and graphical. Also easy to play too. It's very addictive and engaging . But the only problem is It's a pay to win the game with the power ful guns they get from it . I for fact don't like it and it's disappointing. I would suggest to include more skins and other Stuffs in the Elite pass rather then making guns more power.",
            "The game overall is good but pls fix the problem of the sensitivity of the player and especially the scope (of all kind). And pls fix the graphics section. The graphics are not nice, so pls get it like call of duty. So it may look better and then playing this game will become more interesting. And just add more variety of guns and skins. Just these 3 problems forced me to to cut out 2 stars from my review."

The game also glitches and lags alot sometimes so much that I have to exit the app and lose the design, so I have to redo what I just did. This only happens after I have been playing for a little while and it usually glitches because of an ad. I also think that it could be more fun if yiu could design your own stuff and sell it or just to design it, so you can be more creative.",
            "Its an AMAZING game!!! I love it sooooo much. There is one problem. When I had been playing for quite a while I just had to repeat previous shirts, skirts, ect. Other than that its one of the most AWESOME games in the world. I hope you will add some more design's into the game.😘😘😘",
            "I've been playing this game for a long time . I maxed out all my upgrades and unlocked everything . I was playing for over 100 days then all of a sudden it started me again from DAY ONE.. Im super pissed because I never cared about all the stupid ads I just enjoyed the game then after all the time I've spent into this game for it to restart me to day one is a smack in the face...I will most likely be deleteing the app...VERY disappointing.",
            "Fun but needs more options. It would be great if you could make your own designs and have them for sale on the side, either auction style or in the shop. Also the way the ads are set up is not ideal for offline users. Unfair you can only get new things if you watch ads.",
            "This tie die game is so cool because like you just can do it like anything you want you have to make you close and everyone so cool like you can see all these world's there picture you have t-shirt pants skirts and all the people out there I think you should play this game is absolutely amazing OK bye see you guys later thank you for making this game I can wait to do it again😍😍😍"

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

            "This is a fun game when you got no internet like me. I don't get ads cause i'm offline. The reason I give it a four-star is because the game is slow. When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!⛑️",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ✳️ 💫!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ❌ Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

            "I like this game, but a few things I don't get! 1) I have the most points in the Regulation races and am still lying between 9th & 11th in the overall table. 2) When you watch an advert to gain Gold coins, where does the coins go? There is no indication! 3) Why does mine and every other player show there wins as 0 wins, as I have won at least 8 regulation races and about 3 Ladder races! 4) The hot lap, says to race against clock, the clock doesn't start? SORT THESE PROBLEMS OUT!",
            "Overall good game that doesn't require a \"pay to win\" strategy. Great customization tweaks for performance.. Would like to see qualifying rounds for starting position. The endurance races are a little ridiculous, 400 laps can take 3 hours and you've lapped 2nd place 5 times by lap 20. Also AI doesn't seem able to pit and repair cars so in longer races your racing against nothing but slow flaming balls of fire after 10 laps. But issues aside still haven't found a more fun racing game.",
            "I like this game but I wish if the other drivers were smarter instead of just crashing into each other, also I wish if the drivers would stop in the pits because it would just feel more realistic and it's weird watching yourself passing a car half destroyed and on fire. They should add more features like that and make it more realistic. Over all I like it though",
            "Preety good stock car racing game. The controls are better than nascar heat. But what I dont like about this game is that there are no cautions. Also I would like to see more tracks that Nascar currently runs on. Lastly I would give this game a rating of 5 stars if they improved the performace of AI and add a option to add friends.",
            "This is a great game. I would give it 5 stars IF the starting lap was fixed. The cars that arenin the top 3 pos at the start are already about to lap you (i have one of the fastest cars and its still incredibly hard to get back up top). I would love a mechanic to do an actual starter lap instead of using luck to hope the top cars crash"

            "Such a shame, could have been a really cool puzzle game, but there's just far too many ads.. It's literally ridiculous.. I get that you guys have got to make money.. But forced adverts after almost every completed level, plus a banner at the bottom. Is just pure overkill and greed. I played about 6 or 7 levels and just gave up.",
            "I don't normally review games based on their ad count because devs need revenue, but this one needs it to be considered. The game is simple, which is exactly what I signed up for, but a simple game combined with an ad after every 2 second puzzle is just frustrating and discouraging. It feels like a cash grab. The game itself, while incredibly easy, is alright. I was looking for a good stimulating timewaster, and I ended up with an ad exhibition with breaks sometimes. No thank you, I'm deleting.",
            "It's fun, but the ads are ridiculous. You take 5 seconds to beat a level, then have to watch a 30-60 second ad. There should ALWAYS be more gameplay than ads, NOT the other way around! Also, it's very obvious that some patterns get reused over and over, either that or, after a certain number of levels, they start over from level 1.",
            "The idea of this game is pretty cool but the puzzles are really easy and sometimes they repeat. There are ads after each puzzle, if you're really lucky, sometimes you get 2 before an ad. The good thing is that they made the ads skippable but they're still just as annoying, especially because the puzzles only take seconds to complete. If you can handle the ads then this is a good time waster but if you're looking for something stimulating then keep looking cuz they dropped the ball on this one.",
            "A fun enough expirence because ot was free. I personally disconnect from wifi because I read from other reviews that there were too many ads. But I was able to cycle through all of the levels in under 15 minutes. And they REALLY aren't very hard. I know these games are probably meant to pull in children but I'm a 20 year old man and this really didn't cut it for me :/ didn't have glitches or anything but still a sad expirence. It never really elevates in difficulty."

            "Historically this is a great and useful app, but most recently there are a ton of issues. 1, it crashes time and again. 2, other users also say they can't save photos. 3, my saved faves folder has disappeared. 4, latest version didn't need to change, just needed bug fixes, but the new version has not got the same features. 5 iPhone version has nose slimming but android version only has contouring which is not that useful",
            "I love this app, don't get me wrong. But just recently whenever I create a look and try to save it, the photo would usually go to my Perfect365 folder located in my gallery. Now, when I save a photo I can't find it anywhere!! I tried Uninstalling and reinstalling the app... Nothing and it's very disappointing because I use this app often... Please fix this!!",
            "Too many bugs, too many ads, would pay for pro if the app worked. Can't find any saved photos now, app crashes all the time, the ads in app cause more bugs, very slow, very glitchy. Too much happening and very poor quality. I only use it when I want to change the hair color on my pics now cuz nothing else works or looks good.",
            "It won't allow me to save my pics and then be able to post it to a social media like before. I click save over and over and nothing. Its very irritating and hope you guys can do something to fix it!! It used to let me save and post and then they would all be in my \"perfect365\" albumn in my pics. This was one of my favorite apps. But this is so disappointing!! 😕😔"

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "This game is really laggy on my phone but I dont even care, I still enjoy playing it and always will (depends on if theres a big change to it or not) I've unlocked all the skins you can get from the loot box thingies There is kind of a lot of ads so I recommend you turn on airplane mode if you hate ads This app is really fun My rating: 9/10",
            "Absolutely Amazing. Very Addictive and Amazing Speed. Just one thing. So many Ads. But other than that it is the best game I have ever played in my whole life. I also love how you put a Daily Race where we actually get to play with real players. I have absolutely nothing to say. Just It is an Amazing game. I recommend you to download this. It's Amazing.",
            "This game was great and made me feel like I was playing mirrors edge all over again. It did have ads, but that's not why I am not giving it 5 stars as it's a mobile game and I only saw an add every 3 to 4 stages. The reason I am rating it 4 and not 5 is the frame rate. Frame rate is key in these sorts of games. It ran smoothly mostly but sometimes I would encounter frame drops, not massive, but enough to send me plummeting to my doom. Otherwise, the controls are great. And no micro transactions"

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

            "There are times when the game wants you to watch an ad to get a skin but won't let you do it. Then when I die I have to whatch an ad to play again. Most of the skins are bad but the only good ones are the impossible ad ones. And some of the obstacles kill you even if you duck or dodge it. Worst of all, I hit in the green zone on an epic level and got killed somehow.",
            "Very poor game not satisfied plus has too many ads a irritating game.I was just playing level 24 it started flickering and I don't understand what is the need of epic level . Epic level is just like this just for coins.Coins we can collect while winning. I am angry due to so many ads after each level ad. For opening chest room ad. For new skin ad , means this game is filled with ads and I don't like the games which have ads.I am not satisfied with the game and. I wanted to give zero stars to it.",
            "Experience on this game is amazing you can get so much out there you can get new Skins and it can sort teach you how to be more skilled to but the game is quite buggy the game is kind of different it's not a normal game and I would not recommend this game well I would but but if you ever played this game I'm sure you feel same way but all you need to do right now is just download the app",
            "If ads pop up, just turn of your WI-FI or Mobile Data, that way you won't get any ads at all. That will make the game less laggy too! I love this game, it's interesting, and quite funny too. I rate it 5 stars.",
            "I rate this Five because this is cool for me i don't mind it the ads. The ads it's little, i like this game i love so much i think i'm up too 100 but it's fine this game i like it."

None of the other games asks me to enable auto-sign in , neither those games have any problem like this. (2) Unable to Change Servers & Asia is missing (3) No Option to disable aim-assistant.

            "Best game. Sensivity of this game is best. Graphics are best. Easy to push our rank. And the best game under 50 mb. And their are more than 6 map in this game. The new update is awesome. And one request can you change the clan war settings.",
            "The new update looks shinny and new market place plus market place emulates steam workshop and feels similar to CSGO stuff. There are more skins than before, each included in a specific tagged group which seems nice. Haloween grenades also seem nice.So far new update is cool with new add ons. EDIT: Found problems, low graphics doesnt have low resolution anymore which makes game laggy(add ultra low graphics option). And maps wont download if i find match. I always have to restart it to download.",

Rushing to turn in a paper only to have the scanning app you've been using without issues suddenly lock, with no warning, unless you pay them 20 dollars, just casually holding you hostage. In a panic, you fork over 20 dollars because what else are you gonna do? Anyway your paper ends up late, AND you're out 20 bucks. The kicker? They then ask you to rate the app. The only clickable option? 5 stars. These guys are dirtbags.",

            "Great for those idle moments at the various jobs I've worked. It's a fun twist of a platform runner type of game. The different gun sounds are also quite entertaining. Not to mention hearing \"HEADSHOT\" the way the game does it is satisfying. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something complex, but other than that I enjoy it.",
            "Honestly, I got bored of this after a while so I deleted it, but I hot it back today and it's just how I remember it. It's a pretty fun game. It's simple but fun. Turn in airplane mode if you don't want any ads but you won't get any skins or free guns. Other than that I'm done rating for now. All in all I think this would be a good download for you",
            "Not a bad game. There's quite a few ads, but that's expected from a free game. Gameplay is repetitive but still fun. My issue is with updates. It's been months since there has been an update to story mode, hideout, or gun skins. There hasn't even been new guns or outfits to unlock in the weekly challenge. It's just hammers to unlock, which is pointless when I already have the hideout built completely.",
            "The game is very fun. The ads are reasonably spaced out, about one every 2-3 levels. The gameplay is fun, and you are able to pick how you want to play. The different guns don't have that much of an impact on the difficulty, allowing you to pick your favorite gun, regardless of how much damage it says it does, because everyone except the occasional boss goes down in one hit.",
            "I like the looks of it, but all the movement is automated. The only thing you do is tap the screen when your laser gets on the targets. If I controlled more of the game, I'd like it better. But the concept and art is on point."

            "This game is really addicting. It does have a problem with spamming ads at you after every level, so I recommend putting your o hone or Tablet on Airplane mode to help with this. The skins are one of the best parts. They are so very cute. I recommend this game.",
            "Very entertaining! Very addictive and it doesn't take up too much space. I like the skins. I just wish it had a cloud backup so I can continue where I was on my old phone. There is a lot of ads so I reccomend turning on airplane mode. Definitely a no. 3 on my top 10 apps. Would recommend!",
            "I'm not gonna lie but to be honest, this game is just like those typical instant making games with little to no serious effort unlike those like idle heroes which put it lots of effort. Also, this game spams lots of ads, and the ones for itself is just total rubbish, doing the I'm a GODDAMN FREAKING NOOB kinda things and accidental touches automatically triggers the link to the install window. Nope, definitely not touching this one since it's just one of the so many trashy ones popping recently.",

            "Ads: annoying / Gameplay: boring / This is very annoying this game doesnt deserve any stars! I'm uninstalling this app the ads are 30 seconds long! Soooo annoying that I can't even play the game! Why!? Fix it or the players won't play this. I'm sticking to my other games now (╬ Ò ‸ Ó)"

            "I really love this app it keeps me on track and on time. As the old saying goes better sleep means better work. I can use this app as a visual silent alarm. I also use it with my boys so they know when it's time to do their homework or to take a shower and get ready for bedtime. Great Job on developing this app. 👍",
            "Would rate 0 stars if i could. Worked just fine first couple weeks, absolutely loved it for the greyscale and DnD activation at night while charging. Made it easier to get to sleep. But now its not turning off in the morning and I'm missing important alarms and getting up late because of it! If I set it to turn off at a certain time so my alarms can go off, I expect it to turn off! Went from loving this to hating it literally overnight.",
            "At 5:30 a.m., while I was still sleeping, I was awoken by an audible notification (even though my default sound is set to silent) from this app, to tell me the app could help better manage my sleep. Waking me up from sleep with not enough time to fall back asleep before my kids wake up is NOT HELPFUL.",
            "It was good at beginning but as i noticed trends. Since the time google has allowed other companies give digital wellbeing it has got worse on Google devices. I am using Pixel 3xl and its Always showing wrong data. Apps which i didn't even open show time of 30-40m. Underpins the whole task of tracking activity and has lost its foundation as an app. Useless app right now.",
            "It would be nice if the app was easier to acquire (lots of phones are not supported by it, a large part of them probably never will). It should be built into every Android 9+ version. Other than that, the app helped me reduce my usage of some social media apps drastically - no more scrolling for half an hour!"

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

            "I used to play this before and i just dowloaded it again. But there is a glitch. You cant get past level 5 which is the shield boss. Once u die on the level, the robot comes to save you and it is supposed to kill the zombie but now, the robot causes no damage. Had to delete the game because clearly there is a bug.",
            "So far it s a great game, i am now at stage 400+, but there is something i want to request... regarding the green chip and blue chip, my weapon are already legend and can only be step up using only yellow, pink and colorful chip to become mythic.. my green and blue chip are useless.. so can you please put an NPC that i can trade a certain amount of green to become blue chip then blue into yellow and so on, so that those chip still be useful. Hope you can grant my request, thanks much.",
            "Fun game IF REWARD VIDEO was AVAILABLE. I don't care if it isn't available give me the reward without the video... I have played many other games that don't run out of videos like this game. Awesome game, if everything worked like it does sometimes. I had tornado gun at lvl 250 an got the bounce gun, but it only went to lvl 220 an wants items to rank up, but every previous gun would level up to the same lvl of the gun I had. Guess it's a way to try an cheat money out of people...",
            "When I try to get triple reward, open chests or anything that requires opening an ad; it says REWARDED video is not ready. I also made a purchase but did not get the secondary weapon!!! Last but not least, you can turn off the music but why do you have to if there is no music at all 🤣 Even after the recent update, the problem still exists",
            "At stage 5 the shielded boss came and my shots are useless. No clue/tutorial to fight him. After 30min, out of frustration I charge myself toward him. Health gone but nothing happens. 10min later I was so frustrated and ready end it all, charged towards the boss, then surprise2, a robot came down. The robot damage the boss so slightly it takes 15 min to kill it. Clearly this game made by a brainless zombie"

THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",

Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

            "Yes I enjoy the relaxing game but unfortunately it is interrupted nearly every single advertisement by a still picture advertising a theatrical booking to the point that it is impossible to get rid of, ,the only way is to completely turn off my device and reboot it,,, I'm going to have to delete the game and download something else, ,it's not relaxing anymore, , it's become a chore, ,thank you",
            "So far, I love this. Easy to play,relaxing, short ads! Graphics are sharp, great levels, progressively more difficult. Especially love the little helper dragon who blasts you out of tough blockades, in fact, his little magic wand slowly refills and allows you to blast through rocks over again. This is so much more satisfying, some games arm you with the wrong color bubbles, forcing you to buy bombs. No thank you! So far this is #1 for me great job to this app maker, thank you!",
            "Would've given 5 stars but certain ads (yatze) do not let you exit the ad and continue game play. Have to exit the game and reload. Very annoying. Also, there are some disturbing ads containing sexual content. I have requested these ads be removed numerous times but they keep showing up. I will probably uninstall this app because of this even though I really enjoy playing.",
            "What a great way to pass the time It's a good game for the whole family, easy enough for the younger or inexperienced. And yet it's challenging enough for the more experienced 'gamers'. But most importantly is the fact that my family really enjoy this game which, of course, makes for a more enjoyable game night. We're looking forward to other apps by this same company.",
            "You all have way to many advertisement s and then try and force a person to spend money. Not all people that play these games gamble. This game is the first that I have seen this many advertisements. Turns a person off to something they may have really tried if it hadn't been pushed on them. I'm going to uninstall because you have turned me off to a lot of things. Thank you. Happy sailing."

An unknown virus destroyed a large part of the population, leaving only the last handful of survivors on earth. Most of the inhabitants have become zombies or mutated under the influence of the virus. Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry. Unite with others in the streets of Harbortown to fight back zombies and other survivors hiding and hunting for easy prey. Gather your friends and venture together into the most dangerous parts of the city.\r\n\r\nHUGE ONLINE WORLD\r\nThe world of Prey Day is an open world shooting game set in a vast city destroyed by a wave of infection. You are left to survive with other humans - the real players. You can communicate with any player you meet, join them in a group, or fight against them to take their loot. There are no rules in open world games!\r\n\r\nCLANS\r\nUnite with other players in powerful clans, opening access to clan locations, where you can discover rare items and unlock new craft that can help you in the war against the undead. Together with your clan you can take over abandoned military bunkers, establish a clan base, and start real military action on the streets.\r\n\r\nCRAFT\r\nYou can craft new weapons and equipment from various items collected on your journey. Trigger new craft recipes that can help protect your life against other players - crafting skills allow you to build your own shelter and protect it with traps!\r\n\r\nADVENTURE\r\nWhat caused the apocalypse? In this zombie game you'll complete quests and explore Harbortown. The best zombie games have rich, mysterious storylines, and Prey Day is no different.

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

            "i ended up uninstalling. this game wasn't bad until a recent update prevented you from playing offline. it won't load if you have wifi or data turned off. this wouldn't be as much of a problem if the amount of ads didn't outweigh the actual gameplay (turning off wifi/data was the only way around this). as far as gameplay goes it wasn't anything special, and as far as i'm concerned it's not much more than a cashgrab. but, before the aformentioned update, it was good for killing time at least.",
            "This game is fun, but if only the race again button was there every round. Its so hard having to just close the app and re-open it every time I lose the race. Its challenging, but its easy! I hope you take my advice and MAKE SURE TO CLOSE THE APP AND RE-OPEN IT EVERY TIME YOU LOSE THE RACE. And do you play with real people in this one game? I mean its geting annoying having games that seem to have real people playing, but only have an AI. Also I don't like having to watch an add everySec",
            "The game freezes a lot. I loose the won matches. It will freeze in the mid point of the match i.e. while you are running and will force you to close and reopen the app once again. Thus, loosing the whole match. One more disgusting thing is that it will also force you to close the app and reopen it once again if you loose the game more than three times. Thus, back to the same thing - \"Loosing the Whole Match\". Please Fix This Problem... It's very disgusting to loose the games again and again...😣",
            "I hate this game sometimes but actually like this game,so I have this game 4 stars(this game is a online game).I wanted to give this game 5 stars because it has wonderful graphics,so many skins,lots of backgrounds,3 players can play this game in the same time and even 4 structures (normal,body builder,thin and fat)!but,the only thing is that if I lose 3 times then I can't play the game anymore!😡but anyways I love Run race 3d a lot so I gave this game 4 stars.",
            "When you will first play this game you will like it! And then after two or three days you will see long long ads and when the cut option come you can't tap that if you try your play store will open!and sometimes it got no options for next level and it repeats one level twice! And that's the reason why i gave this 2 Stars pls improve these things and it's offline! Thanks."

Please improve it.",

            "This game is awesome my favorite game on this is zombie mode that is super cool and just game I don't know what to say I like the first and the other one they're good but this game is very amazing I hope you have some more updates like you game modes and I hope you have a good Halloween🎃",
            "Hi NESM.This game is good it is good, but the things are hard to get like hulk and some other weapons I rate it 5 but please be sure to fix this problem for the people who have money it's easy but people who dont it's hard. Plz make hulk cheaper. Thank u.",
            "The game is epic, I'm not gonna lie. The first thing that irritates me is, I cannot see the gauge of other sticks. I just keep on fighting them until I can't fight no more. The second thing is, we can't take other sticks' weapons after they have died. If they die, they must leave the weapons behind so that I can take them and finish the rest of the sticks off. Those are the only things that I wanna see in the game. Maybe you'll add them in Anger Of Stick 6: The End Of The World 😃😃",
            "Very good and additive game but only one problem; can you change the archer control function? It is a bit difficult to aim and yes one thing! I think you should add horse riders BTW very well done ✅ keep updating 🤠 Thank you 😊"

            "I loved this game until i hit level 1136. I had a few issues with it before this. It froze on me maybe 3 times and wouldnt give me another bird to complete a level. Other than that i truly enjoyed it. When i hit my level the screen went black. I uninstalled it. Hoping it would work again, i installed it again. The screen is still black. I will miss this game. My grandaughter and i would take turns playing it. Also love the bear that needs to be fed so you can keep playing.",
            "If you're looking for a game that's easy but still makes you feel accomplished, this is it. Scoring is arbitrary. Another great thing is that there's nothing to buy in-game. The sound effects are ASMR-worthy. Ads are short and not terribly disruptive.",
            "An amazing game. Keeps me busy when i am bored. I have finished the game and i was expecting more levels. So if there can just be more levels in the next update that would be spectacular because its an amazing game with so many suprises. 😊😊",
            "I really enjoy this game not difficult at all very good with eyes coordination when it comes to colour and your fruits It's also very good for the children to play as it keeps there mind going as well as my sister loves playing this game too. I start over each time . I complete 1600 sessions. you now have add with no X or close Have to close game and start over please fix.",
            "I loved the game it is fantastic but the problem is that out of no where the ads come and the ads does not end quickly😤 I am irritated of all this if you control the ads then I can give you all 5 stars 😒😒 but yah above all this things the levels should be harder it is very easy to earn 3 stars but yah I am not gonna delete in the hope that you will improve the levels 🙂🙂"

            "I really like this game, but I have one problem. Actually the problem is that the decorations are locked that's why If we try to win the contest the decorations are locked that' s why we are failed in winning the contest. And if we are trying to unlock the decorations its lost of our money. Please can't you try to unlock those decorations. That's why I had give only three stars",
            "This a very good game and fun to play. The reason I gave it two stars is that after making a cake, they show an ad..and no matter how much I try to, it won't close..I have to exit the game and restart, losing all my progress..The same thing happens everytime. This is the second time I installed this app. I was hoping for a better experience this time But....😔😔",
            "This game is very awesome and I like the graphics they have made. This is the most stunning game I have ever seen in my life. This is the second time I have installed this game. Please rate 5 star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. This the most wonderful game play ever! I spend almost half of the day playing this. Thank you for the Table Time (TT). I love the way they have made the graphics. Me, my cousin sister and her father loves to play it all day long even when are doing work. Thank you.",
            "This game is very good , but there are lots of things which are not opens just like for example - doll cake . If we want to make a doll cake his face is not opens so what we can do and not only doll face is note open there are lots of things in this game which are not opens why , anybody will give me the reply 🤔🤔 why it's not opens , so that's why I don't like this game very much . 🤗🤗",
            "Very slow gameplay and very little of it. Half or more of the time you play will be watching very slow animations of things being done that you have nothing to do with. Cut the top of a strawberry? Wait while the game shows you it being put in a blender. This does not make for engaging gameplay. Not to mention the very first cutscene of the game stops as soon as it starts to show you an ad. Garbage."

It is very great, but I request to developers please improve the steering response and when I want to see right mirror the camera quickly comes back to its position. So I can't see right side for long time while turning. And also please add (+ & -) in semi-automatic transmission. Overall game is too great and addictive. I love this game too much. Waiting for UPDATE..!!!",
            "Best bus simulator . surely download it but there should be changes. like first you should give guide how to play because while first time I was confused that where is bus terminal and how to start new route so you should do this changes but after playing for two to three time we can understand the game but in that money is wasted for fuel. other everything is best",
            "I love the idea of the game so much that it's addictive to play regularly and the reason why I rated 4 starts it's that the game steering wheel its not good and there's no bus stations that is empty no people waiting for the buses and no buses coming in and out of the station that way I rated 4. I'll rate 5 starts when I'll see those changes I hope the game programmers improve the game and thinks for making the game.",
            "Of all the bus games, this is the best game of my life. I have a lot of fun playing the game. However there is a problem that this game takes too long for passengers to get on and off the bus at some stations which is very annoying. I think the time should be reduced through updates.",
            "Its a very good game which make ma happy with its challenges on the road, but it occupy long time for the passenger to enter and depart. My suggestion is: establish a new system of taking a sample of few passenger in order to save time"

            "Honestly one of the best fps games in the play store that I've played. Love the weapons, the graphics, and the overall feel of the game. The ability to backup/restore really comes in handy for moving to new devices, or even if you just want to delete the app for a while when you're low on storage. Wish there was an online multiplayer, however the lack of that is not enough to rate this any lower than 5 stars. Great game overall.",
            "It's a good game but it's missing some important things like customizable control and auto shoot if possible but most importantly customizable controls, it is really hard to aim and shoot at the same time with thumb only if we could get multiple finger support for example allow us to shoot in right and left both side so with right finger I can aim and with left I can hold it down to shoot, I hope we'll get it soon 😁 great game.",
            "It is a best app to play like free fire Advantages: *good graphics *good gun collection *good creations *good game for fighting the zombie *we can play both offline&online Disadvantage : *THere is no jumping key. So this is the only disadvantage for mee. This zombie shooting game is very interesting to play. So everyone try this game.",
            "One of the best zombie games on mobile. But, as always, half the guns can only be attained with 'Gold'. Meaning, practically impossible to attain. So, basically need to pay real money to attain, or watch tonnes of ads to play casino for a chance to get a few gold at a time. Dead Trigger 2 is no more generous either.",
            "The game is really good with graphics, Here is the bad of it.. -First the Aim side is in same side with the shooting button, thus very difficulty to manage both. -Second you have made the prices of weapons to be very high in such a way that no body can afford. -Third, knowing that we can't afford weapons, you have made the missions to be very hard really it's boring. -Fourth,at least you could design a place to hide,zombies are coming in all directions as rain and you find youself in the middle."

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

Snake's speed is very slow. 2.Please add the setting to make our own snake's colour. 3.The joystick is very small ,fix the setting to make it big by ownself. If you set this problems then this game is good and if you fixed my problems then I give you 5✡✡✡✡✡. Please fix my problems 😢😢",

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",

            "This is a fun game, and I used to love playing it a lot, but they've decided to become obnoxious with the ads to try to annoy people enough to buy the ad free version. Each game session is two minutes. There is now a \"halftime\" in each one to force you to pause and watch another ad in addition to the ones before and after the game. I understand the need for ads, but as much as I have enjoyed this game, this move isn't making me want to upgrade. It just makes me want to find a different game.",

Please community of the game answer me and fulfill my wish. thx for making this fun game",

They even feel the need to interrupt your two minute game with a half time ad. If you like watching ads, get this game, since that's all there is to do. Devs, you did a good job of screwing things up. Way to go.",

Also when we turn into that humongous minion ball, it tends to get stuck inside buidigs , in corners etc and doesnt move for quite a while. This costs precious game time..."

Now we go to play and everything has to be bought. She is so upset. There was no mention of a trial period. I was going to buy her some packs as a birthday surprise but if this is the way the company does business I will spend my money elsewhere. I would rate lower than 1 if I could.",
            "It is fun...but you only get to make smoothies for free which is pretty dissapointing. You can make smoothies with different ingredients but there are only 2-3 decorations that you can add for free.",
            "To people who are saying that this app is a scam it is not I have had this app for ages and nothing is wrong with it so them people saying \"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP BECAUSE YOU NEED TO PAY FOR STUFF\" say that all you like because I had it longer then you and its a good game I recommend you listen to this👉 this game is not a rip off its a good game for your kids my kids play it and so do I.I might have a addiction but it's better than saying mean stuff about it and the creater.go away haters.",
            "I like this game but I have two reasons why I hate this game reason number one the adds like how annoying and reason twolike every time I try to unlock something I have to pay like how annoying and for example oh I want a cake pop and I how to pay $9 for straws and cake pops like these people are crazy and make me spend so many dollars over this dumb stuff like how annoying these people are crazy",
            "I always look at the comments before I download the game and when I looked at the comments some of the said DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME because they say you have to PAY MONEY to get the dishes and all the other things so the people who maked this game are reading please upgrade it but I am sorry to say but this game officially SUCKS sorry :("

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

But i do have one major flaw thats been bugging me. When i go to redownloading this game on other devices & log back into my account via facebook & google play the game has depleted half of my progress that I had few years back & i know this because i was over level 100 I believe & now Im back at level 45.",
            "Ridiculous that you have to pay real cash to get character mods. You can't pick what character you want to battle with. Takes forever to level up characters unless you want to spend hundreds of real dollars. New update...now gem levels green, purple, and orange have a ground shake that kills any character within 10 seconds of play. Not fun to play if you can't advance power ups. No explanation or any way to beat level.",

            "Loved the game for a long time, for years.. Love the graphics and all. Compared to other racing games its way better. My issue is that eveything is all about money now, you gotta pay to advance. It wasn't the case before. There were some in game purchases before but nothing like it is now. What made it enjoyable, and what makes me want to always play, is that I may not purchase everything to get ahead. I just wish it was like it was before...",
            "I love the graphics and all the different modes that there are...really good game...tho I would put the multipling earnings with ads...that can give users the option of doubling the credits or the same amount of fusion coins... example: you got 1000 credits on a race...you get the option of multipling them, so you get 10,000(1,000x)...soo that we also have the option of instead of only double earning credits... Also fusion coins...buy we get the same amount we would get if it was normal credits.",
            "Very disappointed! I thought the latest update was the best update since they have included the high frame rate settings on my ASUS Max Pro M2. The game was very smooth at 60fps and I didn't encounter problems or glitches. But after I opened the game again the settings for high frame rate was gone. The cost of upgrades is already so expensive, at least give us a chance to enjoy the game @ 60fps.",
            "I don't think making a comment is going to change anything, but I will go ahead and vent a bit. This game is fun, but super expensive. Like, all the cars in S class cost tokens all of a sudden. What happened to plain old credits? Sure, the prices were exorbitant, but there was some silver of hope. With these ridiculous token prices, how are those of us who cannot/do not pay to play make any progress? And how does one even go about earning a decent amount of tokens? Honestly.",
            "Latest update reduces value of original currency to ZERO. You spend all this time earning it, now it's worth NOTHING. It has been replaced with a currency introduced a few updates ago. AVOID AT ALL COST!!! The game is decent. It's just Gameloft that SUCKS!!!! If Gameloft makes the game, find a different one. It will be better in the end!!"

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

How can you be so $$$ hungry??? Until these things are resolved you will not ever get a 5 star review from me.",
            "The game is great. But the payment is too small. The cars are too expensive. Upgrading a car is a big problem. Tokens are nearly impossible to get.. I have been playing this game for 3 years and i have only 1 car bought with token, 3 years!!! It's frustrating... It's high time you work on this game and give us a new upgrade..",
            "I would give it a 4 star beacause mostly the gameplay is cool and the fact that you can bump into stuff. The graphics are amazing and you can change the angle of the camera. But because is a lot of the cars cost money and theres not that much cars that dont actually cost real money. At leats make a couple of cars that dont cost money ( not saying its a pay to win game )",
            "Great game. Thanks to the the team who created such an amazing game. Awesome graphics, nice cars, everything on the game are so pretty. But it is so tough to buy a car with tokens. Cause after finishing a chapter or level there is no tokens are given. Please, work on it.",
            "I'm sorry but I last played in 2017. I used to like this game very much and so had progressed a lot. But after 3 years, when I'm again logging in it is starting from the beginning!?! I'd used Play Games account back then and it's still showing me 48/70 achievements. But when I'm logging in the game, it is not syncing and forces me to play from the very beginning!

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "It's a nice, time consuming game. However, there are two things I'm not a fan of. I'm not very fond of the fact that an ad shows up on one side of the screen before starting a round. It gives my finger less room to move. And I don't like how there is an ad after every single stage. I understand that you would like to make money, but you should maybe tone down the ads and beat around the bush a bit.",
            "amazing - so addicting - currently on level 160 Update: I have since reset my progress and I'm back playing the game and it's as fun as ever. Unlike everyone else I haven't experienced too many ads so it's even more enjoyable just the right amount of fun and difficult I rate this game a good 10/10 as always very fun and one of my favorite games of the all VOODO games. Thanks for creating this idea to make into a game, very fun and I have yet to experience glitches.",
            "This game is very addictive and satisfying, whenever I get boared I start playing this game but it has so many ads that disturbs me alot that I dont actually like and we can't continue playing properly in concentration , so you should have less ads in between of the game that's why I gave 4 starts instead of 5 starts but this game is very nice , I love this game very much so pla try to have ads less in the between of game as it very disturbing sometimes that people may not like about the game .",
            "This game is good to play but I did not like the colours of some levels. The colour of the ball sometimes is green, and it looks gross. It is not some beautiful green or any beautiful shade of it, and I really do not like to even see or play this game. Please improve that. I did not really wanted to say it like this, but I had to tell you so you can fix this problem.",
            "This game is really addictive. I play this when I get bored of my other games. There are ads but this game is worth sitting through them. Legit i showed my mom this game and she immediately downloaded it. She's really bad at it though. I really recommend this game. There are plenty of rage quit moments but I don't actually quit. Its one of those games where if you keep dying instead of getting mad and giving up you feel determined to keep going. Love this game."

Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",

            "Way too many ads. Also not technically a pool game. No matches, competition, adversaries... This is more of a puzzle game that happens on a pool table. The levels are too easy and go by very fast so you're constantly bombarded with ads at each level change. The game itself is fun at the beginning but gets old very fast as the only thing that increases the difficulty is the shape of the table. Also some levels are identical, some the balls change colors but everything else stays the same.",
            "There are ads every level. You can't even play online and the sensitivity of the stick is really fast. I can not stand this game because I have to make the most basic shots and I gets boring pretty quick (obviously depending of the style of game you like to play). The levels are to easy and sometimes I don't every get a correct board I get curvy line all the time.I guess it's good in some respects by just a quick game before you go out. I do not recommend if you are an online type of person.",
            "This is one smooth algorithm, superb quality graphics and easy to use. In fact it works so well that I have one suggestion...could it please be a real game of pool? Two players. maybe an optional bar fight (just kidding,,then again..) please consider this as most simulation programs of real world games don't come close ..this game is only 10% off the actual sport... I hope you will consider this.. WELL DONE TEAM.",
            "Pooking is a fun game, graphically well presented. The only drawback is if you use a tablet to play the game, it is easy to touch the cue button before you have measured the strength of the force you would like to hit the cue ball with. This results in a light shot that barely notes the object ball. It happens when I rotate the tablet to get a better view of the desired angle when the object ball is far from a pocket. I find that I touch the button that releases the cue prematurely.",
            "It is the best ever, than any other game l played or have found in the internet, really lam using it for more than an year, l just wish to see it got updated and a new games have been added additionally to it,, 1020 games are not enough, please, make it 2040 or 6060 ,,, we are ready to winn the CROWNs !!! I have already won 1020 ones, but within a year or so , that means it has taken my time to get fun with it,, and that is the target l enjoy to reach !!!"

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

            "Really great innovative puzzle game, which is really about symmetry. I love seeing new dynamics like this instead of just rehash after rehash of the same core mechanics. Highly recommended. Feedback For devs: It was very entertaining for 5-10 hours, but then I started to get bored and want some new ideas to play with. The fact that fusion is not predictable (when heavier element fuses into lighter element) makes some deeper strategies inaccessible.",
            "I have absolutely no idea what this is about, what are the objectives, what happens and why, b'coz the tutorial explains nothing. Sometimes I finish a game, don't really know If I lost or won, or what, b'coz the game doesn't really say so. BUT! If you tap the same spot again and again, atoms emerge, and SUDDENLY, they start vanishing with each tap, until you are left with Beryllium or Lithium or stuff. Plus, the sounds are cool. So there!! 5 stars.",
            "Played it over the years and still love it, but you guys should upload new screenshots to this page, the actual app looks way better. The lack off progress saves is disappointing, you loose everything when you uninstall the app, everything. Including antimatter, thats just like thievery... how could you provide an online transaction that isn't saved to your account, why eben allow account then...",
            "I love this game. I'm addicted to it. I play every day, constantly trying to get farther, get a higher score. I only have one complaint. There is a bug in the game where, if you undo at a wrong moment, you could cause extra atoms to spawn around the circle, or if you undo a fusion, you could get the final atom and the atoms used to make it. Please fix this! It's frustrating when you have a good streak going, and you missclick and need to undo, just to have this glitch ruin a run",
            "I really like the game, by which I mean my brain finds it pleasing, but my game progress does not transfer between devices, thus losing unlocked atom boosts, anti matter, best score, etc. I don't know if this is intentional, but it lost a 🌟 from me."

It doesn't work on the lock screen, on the pull-down menus or even on the icons at the top of the screen. Then the ad screen at the end doesn't scroll, so if you're in landscape you can't kihit the \"done\" button. A bad copycat of another much more useful app.",
            "This app seems to install a trojan horse on one's device. While I had it, my bluetooth kept switching on, no matter what I changed in my device settings. Unistalling this app solved the problem. My antivirus was constantly scanning for malware. Since I uninstalled, that has also stopped. That's very disappointing, since I suffer from migraines and it works well as a filter. Beware this app!",
            "I like this bright green color. This is a really good blue light filter.",

            "This game is so cool and fun but the problem is that we cannot unlock hairstyles, frocks and so many things. It just made annoyed and disappointed 😔. And when we try to unlock it, it asks for money. Please fix this and make it all free with no money. If fix this problem I WILL GIVE 5 STARS. But overall this game is good and I love it 😊.",
            "I absolutely HATE this game, it's just terrible, I haven't even had it for 1 hour before I deleted it. The game has an add every 10 seconds, literally. It is also very laggy, and when I tried to create the skirt it makes you pull the entire fabric over and in the end it looks like trash, so I would rate this a 0 star if I could, You are Welcome.",
            "Hello...Myself Nidhi... This is a very nice game....Only the problem is toooooo much of adds and if google add will come then we can't go again to the game...we should clear that game and then go again...Plz update and fix this problem...I dont need adds.... Is it online....Plz tell me.... If this add problem goes then it can be 4 or 5 stars.... Nice game then👌",
            "This game is interesting.. The only problem is that you can't unlock any of the accessories or designs and they seem to be locked forever.. There isn't even an option for unlocking them. I am at 1st position, and still I can't use that hair-dressing place. I have a suggestion, that it would be great, if there would have been an option that we can earn money in the game, and we could unlock those items, by spending that money. Because they ask for real money to unlock them. But overall 👍👍",
            "Its fabulous ! No much ads! Best part we can post our diy videos! Feel like i have a social media or youtube channel since i don't have it provide 98% like youtube similarity! Just pls for me add an option to comment the commenters bots! Then it will provide 100% youtube or any channel like bots says\"wow! Im on it!\" So there should be an option of writting back them too! No matter if they not reply but it will be my heartwinning! So pls add it! Overall i love it!but 4 stars cus we get bore early"

The most u can win, even in 1st place, is like $450 & that's if u watch an ad. The car I have now cost me $150,000. Had 2 watch many ads lol. 😄 U can buy $$, but that's cheating.🤥 I do really like this game, but PLEASE MAKE NEW TRACKS FOR US! This GAME is 2 GREAT not 2!! MUCH LOVE & HAPPY HALLOWEEN! ☠🎃👻",

            "It's fun in the beginning, but gets boring pretty quickly. All the courses seem to be randomly generated, but only between the few different obstacles, so everything is repetitive. The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

And if you are thinking about your child to play this game well thats fine with you but with me I don't think that its ok because some of the songs have cuss words but thats just me.",

            "Good, but has a major bug. The highest level can only be achieve if played in that category for consecutive days. I have tried various times and the final level is still not unlocked. Overall fun and the 2 player works well."

            "I like this game but I don't understand why you have to watch adds to get some clothes. It's so annoying but other than that it's a great game. I like the way you don't get the same clothes for every girl. It's fun because you can use your imagination but I really wish you could move the people around. It's ok for kids but at the start they're all in bra's!! It's cool that you can start with any girl though. So it has a good side and a bad side",
            "Hooray, this update brings a much needed feature - saving your progress. Thanks, devs! This game is enjoyable. So many possible combinations, I've played for months, and still haven't created the same girl twice. Lots of categories - skirts, pants, shorts, long shirts, short shirts, jackets, scarves, jewellery, make-up, hair and more. Plus 4 skin tones for a realistic group of girls. The best dress-up game I've downloaded, definitely worth installing!",
            "This is good enough but my opinion is that you just change the yellow girl cuz she's not my favorite but thank you and she does not have good outfits you need to make more outfits for them and please don't make them extra fancy they all go she's my favorite but she needs more good clothes",
            "Game was okay but I did have a problem with a dressing it up so I could get there while you could only dress it up and you couldn't do anything with it so that's why I gave it to just start reading but I wouldn't really recommend you couldn't get it cuz it's kind of boring.",
            "This game is excellent, fabulous, fantastic, amazing, and interesting. I love this game. I suggest you to also try rhis game to those who will see my comment and I am sure you will also love it"

            "Some things I noticed + compared to CR:OB 1) Story. It's...mediocre at best. Pretty simple; guy comes in, steals candy, you gotta go get it and restore the place. CR has many originals. Take inspo.! 2) Gameplay. Almost exactly like CR's. Same mechanics and almost the exact same power ups. Even the jelly/candy collecting is the same. Some lag, you get hit once and you're done, jumping animation is a bit long. 3) Characters. Multiple characters to choose from like CR. Needs more variety.",
            "Very good game... like the other outfit 7 games, it is also interesting... just before I was playing the \"Talking Tom Friends\" and that game became boring after playing it during around 70 days.. therefore I installed this game as I know the talking games are very much simple and fresh minded... Continue your God blessing work.. 🧚🌼👼👼. My favourite character is angela because she runs smoothly and her look is overall very good. The music of the game is also perfect.The graphics is awesome.",
            "( who are reading this comment please read fully)i have many tom games ,because i like the grapics , the characters and they are sooo cute and concept are nice ,but in the tom hero dash it takes too much time . the game is soo nice but it takes lot of time to load . i posted this in tom hero dash also but no response so posting in this fun game. ok please check it . bye",
            "It is so cute wow the the graphics it is greatest game till now I loved it cutie. Thankyou so much for making it offline I love the fact that when if one player out than other player continue running I will definitely recommend it to my friends too. I was in search of such game these days I keep downloading games and after 1hr or so I delete them I am never satisfied with games but this game is so amazing. 😘🤩🤩"
