        "description": "Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury of the motor component of the motor-speech system and is characterized by poor articulation of phonemes. In other words, it is a condition in which problems effectively occur with the muscles that help produce speech, often making it very difficult to pronounce words. It is unrelated to problems with understanding language (that is aphasia), although a person can have both. Any of the speech subsystems (respiration, phonation, resonance, prosody, and articulation) can be affected, leading to impairments in intelligibility, audibility, naturalness, and efficiency of vocal communication. Dysarthria that has progressed to a total loss of speech is referred to as anarthria. Neurological injury due to damage in the central or peripheral nervous system may result in weakness, paralysis, or a lack of coordination of the motor-speech system, producing dysarthria. These effects in turn hinder control over the tongue, throat, lips or lungs; for example, swallowing problems (dysphagia) are also often present in those with dysarthria.",

            "I like the app a lot since I'm a speech therapist my self. But there's only one downside. I made the donation and got full access, but after I record my voice when I play it back it sounds like cracking, breaking.... it's not a good recording feature. Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",
            "Most stupid app ever seen. This app doesn't deserve one star. Its a waste of time and data. After downloading 47mb, it still want me to connect to internet before it works. Even with the internet connection it keeps saying cannot connect to the server.",
            "Nice app. Paid the subscription for the full version and found it easy enough to record audio and pictures. Big issue though is that it needs internet access to open the app. Big turn off not being able to use the app at all in offline mode. If this was fixed would consider reinstalling and updating the score.",

            "Since I've shown my son this app, he opens the app and goes through the menu and attempts repeats the words by himself, without me having to sit and practice with him. Really easy for him to use."

            "Problems for people with dimentia or Alzheimers... It is NOT appropriate to ask them how well they are remembering things, understanding things, etc.as this app does with the user. Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

This app claims to be designed for aphasia (a language disorder, generally in the adult/geriatric population), but seems much more appropriate for expressive language disorders in children (which is characterized by children having difficulties forming language, but can pronounce speech sounds correctly).

The App can also be used with adults to work on articulation, speech and memory.\r\n\r\nSpeech and Language Therapists will find a selection of vocabulary which progresses in levels of complexity.  The target words are carefully selected to represent differences in word position, sound complexity and word structure.  The app also features a useful ‘repeat and record’ facility.\r\n\r\nThe App contains interesting photographs and illustrations across a variety of topics.  The pictures include common objects, nouns, action words and describing words.  These are an excellent resource to support vocabulary development.\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n-  These exercises cannot replace therapy sessions with a Speech Therapist. Using the app helps with daily home practice, making practice fun and motivating.  It is important for a family member to be present and support the child with their practice.\r\n\r\n-   Before starting these exercises, clients must be able to produce the sound in isolation and in simple syllables.  The exercises and games will help to develop the use of the sound in more complicated words.\r\n\r\n-    If you are not sure what to do, check with your Speech Therapist.",

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: K is an all inclusive app that teaches you how to say K and then how to teach and cue your child how to say the sound. We will then walk you through how to systematically practice K in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say K correctly in the word \"cave\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices K by saying \"kick\" while playing soccer, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say K\r\n~Tips on how to teach K to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say K and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say K correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online K flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying K\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on K for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for K even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02708290. \r\n\r\n• Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises designed to last for 10 years\r\n\r\n• Used by over 1,000,000 children with language delay\r\n\r\n• Best Autism App on the Healthline’s list\r\n\r\n• Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Farsi, and Chinese.\r\n\r\nMental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with language delay and autism. MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n• Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.\r\n• Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.\r\n• Based on Pivotal Response Treatment that targets development of response to multiple cues. \r\n• Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time\r\n• Identify colors, patterns and sizes\r\n• Integrate objects into a unified picture\r\n• Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front\r\n• Time prepositions: Before/After\r\n• Passive verb tense\r\n• Subject / Object\r\n• Reading and Writing\r\n• Numbers and counting\r\n• Arithmetic\r\n• Logic and reasoning\r\n• Mental perspective taking\r\n• Mental mathematics\r\n• Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun\r\n• No Wi-Fi necessary\r\n• No ads\r\n\r\nMITA develops your child’s imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child's ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \r\nThe verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\r\nMITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. MITA exercises can be used by children with language delay, ASD, PDD, intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), Down syndrome, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as a supplement to conventional speech therapy.\r\n\r\nMITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J. Elgart and a group of award-winning artists and developers working alongside experienced therapists.\r\n\r\nMITA in the news: https://youtu.be/giZymh3rMHc\r\nMITA research articles: http://imagiration.com/research/",

Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. <br>The verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.<br>MITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. MITA exercises can be used by children with language delay, ASD, PDD, intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), Down syndrome, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as a supplement to conventional speech therapy.<br><br>MITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J. Elgart and a group of award-winning artists and developers working alongside experienced therapists.<br><br>MITA in the news: https://youtu.be/giZymh3rMHc<br>MITA research articles: http://imagiration.com/research/",

            "Very good game! Thus, for language it is important 1. To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered. I have to change a level back manually at each session, because I am sure that my child does not remember a name of an object, but got the program algoryth using visual clues.",

When I finally realized I was being charged $37 US per month I figured out how to canc it through Google but was told there is a no refund policy. I did not use the app after the trial period and think I should get my money back. Apps make it easy to use but difficult if you are trying to unsubscribe or cancel.",
            "I believe the best feature of this help is the videos of kids are actually kids. They don’t sound bossy as an adult would seem to a kid with autism. Since they’re peers to my daughter, she gets encouraged to imitate them and learn from them. We’ve seen the improvement in weeks. She sounds better day by day and the app is obviously beneficial but also fun at the same time enough to keep her focused without feeling like lectured."

I could be great if it acually worked but it seems as if it did not fully download. I only have maybe 1 out of every 10 pictures on the flashcards. Most videos do not seem to be available. PLEASE FIX!! Ok so after reading other reviews I uninstalled and reinstalled app. Works fantastic now. Would be helpful if they would mention that this seems to be necessary for app to work properly.",
            "It would be great. But I purchased the full version and 60% of the flashcards are blank and say error when you tap them. Memory match freezes a lot Not worth the $20 Also individual letter sounds would be amazing",
            "I would give this app 0 stars if I could, this is a rip-off, be very aware of the \"sale\" it makes you think you are unlocking all the letters for 19 dollars and some change but they only unlock one letter, so if you want to unlock all the alphabet be really to spend OVER $500 dollars, they got me with almost 20 dollars so I'm wondering how many more people are like me falling for it.",

When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",
            "It's great app for special child..but it's much costy to compare to other apps.if a possible prodive some more discount for monthly payment.....",
            "This program is absolutely amazing. I swear they have to be hypnotizing or drugging my little guy the way he calms down excitedly when its otsimo time..🤔 Im gonna need to get a lifetime license",
            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

        "description": "Category Therapy Lite gives you a sample of the types of activities available in the full app. Category Therapy is a professional speech therapy app that practices mental organization skills for individuals who have language problems due to stroke, brain injury, or developmental disorders. You’ll see why speech-language pathologists & families “absolutely love this app,” calling it “highly recommended,” “my go-to app for categories,” & “well worth it!” \r\n\r\nBETTER ORGANIZATION MEANS BETTER UNDERSTANDING\r\nWhen mental organization skills (the ability to group items & name common characteristics) are lost or damaged, it affects our basis for structuring & understanding the world. Category Therapy encourages re-learning categorization skills by providing unlimited therapy using evidence-based exercises on your mobile device. \r\n\r\nIMPROVE CATEGORIZATION SKILLS FROM SIMPLE TO COMPLEX \r\nCategory Therapy features four exercises: \r\nFind | Classify | Exclude | Add One \r\nand three levels of difficulty: \r\nConcrete | Subcategories | Abstract \r\n\r\nCategory Therapy helps patients develop categorization skills along a hierarchy from simple to complex. It was designed by a Speech-Language Pathologist as a stroke recovery tool and is perfect for people who have difficulty speaking or finding words. \r\n\r\nMAKE THE MOST OF THERAPY SESSIONS \r\nCategory Therapy fits within a collaborative rehab model, seamlessly linking the clinic to the home, while connecting therapists to families & clients. It’s a useful assessment tool for professionals to gain insight into the cognition & comprehension of non-verbal patients, and the comprehensiveness of the app allows for extended engagement & practice time. Category Therapy is simple & intuitive for both professionals and patients, providing more repetitions & faster improvements. \r\n\r\nDETAILED DESIGN EMPOWERS USERS \r\nThe clean, high-contrast layout uses realistic photos, recorded voice & easy-to-read print.

        "descriptionHTML": "Category Therapy Lite gives you a sample of the types of activities available in the full app. Category Therapy is a professional speech therapy app that practices mental organization skills for individuals who have language problems due to stroke, brain injury, or developmental disorders. You’ll see why speech-language pathologists &amp; families “absolutely love this app,” calling it “highly recommended,” “my go-to app for categories,” &amp; “well worth it!” <br><br>BETTER ORGANIZATION MEANS BETTER UNDERSTANDING<br>When mental organization skills (the ability to group items &amp; name common characteristics) are lost or damaged, it affects our basis for structuring &amp; understanding the world. Category Therapy encourages re-learning categorization skills by providing unlimited therapy using evidence-based exercises on your mobile device. <br><br>IMPROVE CATEGORIZATION SKILLS FROM SIMPLE TO COMPLEX <br>Category Therapy features four exercises: <br>Find | Classify | Exclude | Add One <br>and three levels of difficulty: <br>Concrete | Subcategories | Abstract <br><br>Category Therapy helps patients develop categorization skills along a hierarchy from simple to complex. It was designed by a Speech-Language Pathologist as a stroke recovery tool and is perfect for people who have difficulty speaking or finding words. <br><br>MAKE THE MOST OF THERAPY SESSIONS <br>Category Therapy fits within a collaborative rehab model, seamlessly linking the clinic to the home, while connecting therapists to families &amp; clients. It’s a useful assessment tool for professionals to gain insight into the cognition &amp; comprehension of non-verbal patients, and the comprehensiveness of the app allows for extended engagement &amp; practice time. Category Therapy is simple &amp; intuitive for both professionals and patients, providing more repetitions &amp; faster improvements. <br><br>DETAILED DESIGN EMPOWERS USERS <br>The clean, high-contrast layout uses realistic photos, recorded voice &amp; easy-to-read print.

Check out the featured stories on Speech Blubs in Thrive Magazine, Autism Parenting, Brisbane Kids, Speech Chick Therapy, Beautiful Speech Life, and The Speech Teacher. Speech Blubs was also honored by winning the Social Impact award and is supported by Facebook’s Start Program.\r\n\r\nThis voice-controlled speech therapy app is designed to help kids learn new sounds and words, and to practice speaking in a stimulating, educational environment. We are proud, though a bit flabbergasted that our 1500+ activities have been used over 1,000,000 times to trigger sound and word production in toddlers, late talkers (speech delay), children with Apraxia of Speech, Autism, Down Syndrome, ADHD, and Sensory Processing Disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SHOULD YOU TRUST SPEECH BLUBS?\r\n\r\nJennifer Marron, B.S., SLP-A\r\nI use Speech Blubs with my articulation students who have a difficult time using their lips and tongue to produce certain sounds (e.g. /b/, /p/, /th/, /l/, etc.). The clients I have used this to have so far loved it and are fully engaged. Thank you for a great application!\r\n\r\nIf that doesn’t give you confidence, you should also know that Speech Blubs\r\n- Uses scientifically proven video modeling for effective speech development\r\n- Has over 1500+ exercises, activities, funny hats, videos, mini-games, and more!\r\n- Releases brand new, exciting content every week!\r\n- Uses 25 fun activity themes – Early Sounds, When I Grow Up, Get into Shapes, Living Colors, This Is My Body, Mouth Gym, Animal Kingdom, Ride Your Wheels, Sing Along, Guess the Word, Guess the Sound, NUMB3R5, and many more!\r\n- Has voice-activated functionality that provides a fun, interactive learning experience\r\n- Makes fun use of special effects like funny hats and masks in real time using facial detection\r\n- Lets you collect stickers and fill your sticker book as your child progresses\r\n- Provides funny and educational content designed to trigger conversation\r\n\r\nTry Speech Blubs activities for FREE!\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFICALLY-PROVEN LEARNING TECHNIQUES\r\nIn a recent study published by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), UCLA researchers proved that watching peers in real time results in MIRROR NEURONS being activated, which has been shown to be highly effective in speech development. Speech Blubs uses video modeling to create an immersive learning environment that allows children to observe their peers on video as they learn. \r\n\r\nNEW, REGULARLY RELEASED CONTENT!\r\nFinally, a rare app that parents won’t mind their kids becoming absorbed in, one that provides a nearly endless supply of content for your children to enjoy, including over 1500 activities, exercises, funny hats and masks, effects, videos, mini-games, and more!

We are proud, though a bit flabbergasted that our 1500+ activities have been used over 1,000,000 times to trigger sound and word production in toddlers, late talkers (speech delay), children with Apraxia of Speech, Autism, Down Syndrome, ADHD, and Sensory Processing Disorder.<br><br><br>WHY SHOULD YOU TRUST SPEECH BLUBS?<br><br>Jennifer Marron, B.S., SLP-A<br>I use Speech Blubs with my articulation students who have a difficult time using their lips and tongue to produce certain sounds (e.g. /b/, /p/, /th/, /l/, etc.). The clients I have used this to have so far loved it and are fully engaged. Thank you for a great application!<br><br>If that doesn’t give you confidence, you should also know that Speech Blubs<br>- Uses scientifically proven video modeling for effective speech development<br>- Has over 1500+ exercises, activities, funny hats, videos, mini-games, and more!<br>- Releases brand new, exciting content every week!<br>- Uses 25 fun activity themes – Early Sounds, When I Grow Up, Get into Shapes, Living Colors, This Is My Body, Mouth Gym, Animal Kingdom, Ride Your Wheels, Sing Along, Guess the Word, Guess the Sound, NUMB3R5, and many more!<br>- Has voice-activated functionality that provides a fun, interactive learning experience<br>- Makes fun use of special effects like funny hats and masks in real time using facial detection<br>- Lets you collect stickers and fill your sticker book as your child progresses<br>- Provides funny and educational content designed to trigger conversation<br><br>Try Speech Blubs activities for FREE!<br><br>SCIENTIFICALLY-PROVEN LEARNING TECHNIQUES<br>In a recent study published by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), UCLA researchers proved that watching peers in real time results in MIRROR NEURONS being activated, which has been shown to be highly effective in speech development. Speech Blubs uses video modeling to create an immersive learning environment that allows children to observe their peers on video as they learn. <br><br>NEW, REGULARLY RELEASED CONTENT!<br>Finally, a rare app that parents won’t mind their kids becoming absorbed in, one that provides a nearly endless supply of content for your children to enjoy, including over 1500 activities, exercises, funny hats and masks, effects, videos, mini-games, and more!

            "We've been trying for a while, but my 2.5 year old is not interested in trying to repeat the words. I'll likely cancel after the first year. Suggestion for the app developers: In the activities where the kids are teaching a new word, you should add a picture of the item in the corner of the screen while the kids say it. Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",
            "Kept seeing ads for this, so I downloaded it! Started the free trial before I decided to buy a subscription, and so glad I did! I couldn't even get a single activity done. There was no sound, the screen kept freezing and the app keeps force closing. Waste of time.",
            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",

Manage your fear and anxiety caused by stuttering through our mediation exercises. \r\n\r\nUnlike traditional speech therapy, the course helps you achieve greater fluency with mindfulness and relaxation techniques.\r\n\r\nThis course was designed by people who used to stutter but were able to become stutter-free thanks to the mindfulness meditation practice. The emerging research on mindfulness and its effects on stuttering suggests that this ancient technique can have profound benefits on how a person who stutters perceives himself/herself. Regular mindfulness practice helps lower levels of stress and anxiety caused by stuttering, improves self esteem, and in many cases helps people to control their stuttering. \r\n\r\nThe 90-day course consists of 9 parts, 10 sessions each. We recommend that you complete one session each day. Preferably in the morning but any other time of the day is fine too. What's important is to practice regularly. This course can be repeated many times. In fact, we recommend that you repeat the course at least 3 times to get more benefit out of it. \r\n\r\nWhat will you get from the course:\r\n\r\nSpeak with more confidence\r\nReduce stuttering\r\nLearn to remain calm\r\nReduce speech anxiety\r\nIncrease mindfulness\r\nBecome a happier human\r\n\r\nYou can try this meditation course risk-free with a free trial.

We love this app i am recommending it to everyone i know.",

Not to mention the kids get really excited to \"do their words\" now! My only concern with the app is that test results don't transfer from separate devices for Android users. If there was some sort of log in and out feature for the app, I believe the entries could be saved on any device the app is used on. ☺️",
            "What a rip off, the 'phrases' and 'sentences' are literally the same for each word in the set of sounds. For example, if you do B sentences it will be 'Bob will beg for a big banana', and then 'Bob will beg for a big ball'. Saying the exact same sentence with one word difference is ridiculous. Don't buy.",
            "I signed up for the free trial and couldn't hear any sound. I then subscribed for a paid version even though I still had the free subscription, and still no sound coming out from the app. I sent a mail to you yesterday about this and I haven't gotten a response. It's getting really frustrating!!!!",

Aphasia is always due to injury to the brain-most commonly from a stroke, particularly in older individuals. But brain injuries resulting in aphasia may also arise from head trauma, from brain tumors, or from infections.\r\n\r\nAphasia can be so severe as to make communication with the patient almost impossible, or it can be very mild.

        "description": "Speech Therapy: B\r\nDoes your child have trouble saying B? We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: B is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say B and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice B with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. So, I created a not so shiny app that will actually help your child. In order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say B correctly in the word \"border\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices B while playing and saying \"ball,\" carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say B\r\n~Tips on how to teach B to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online B flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying B\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on B for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying B!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

        "description": "This app makes daily practice easy and simple because it only takes 1-minute to practice 60 or more target sounds! Fast, noticeable results in a child’s speech are seen within weeks!\r\n\r\nResearch shows that children who use High Frequency, Short Duration practice of target sounds are dismissed from speech therapy more than 8 months sooner than children in traditional programs. This app was created to give parents, teachers and Speech-Language Pathologists a way to tap into High Frequency, Short Duration drills so that every second spent with a child counts! The focus of each round, either in the practice mode or the test mode, is to elicit as many correct responses as possible from a child in the shortest amount of time to establish correct and consistent production of sounds and to change speech patterns.\r\n\r\nParents often report frustration in getting children to practice drills and speech homework at home but with this app it is easy to motivate a child to practice for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n- 21 sounds\r\n- 216 Rounds\r\n- Word, Phrase, Sentence Levels\r\n- Practice & Test Mode\r\n- Easy data acquisition\r\n- Works on Speed & Accuracy\r\n- Simple & Easy to Use\r\n- Unlimited profiles available\r\n- PERFECT for Parents to use for Home Practice!\r\n- 60+ practices in 1 minute!\r\n\r\nThis app allows a child to get right to work.  With short, intense drill practices at the word, phrase and sentence levels children learn to speak and pronounce their sounds in record time. New speech patterns are carried over into everyday life because a child uses speed and accuracy when practicing their target sounds. A must have app if you want to see fast, effective results!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOne-Minute Articulation offers a $1.99, $3.99 monthly renewing subscription and $28.99 yearly renewing a subscription to unlock Basic and Premium functionality.\r\n\r\nThe purchase will be charged from your iTunes account if you choose to buy the One-Minute Articulation Basic and One-Minute Articulation Premium subscription.

            "This a great app developed by an amazing speech therapist!! Her methods have worked wonders for my twins and this app is a great supplement for at home/on the go practice. Not to mention the kids get really excited to \"do their words\" now! My only concern with the app is that test results don't transfer from separate devices for Android users. If there was some sort of log in and out feature for the app, I believe the entries could be saved on any device the app is used on. ☺️",
            "What a rip off, the 'phrases' and 'sentences' are literally the same for each word in the set of sounds. For example, if you do B sentences it will be 'Bob will beg for a big banana', and then 'Bob will beg for a big ball'. Saying the exact same sentence with one word difference is ridiculous. Don't buy.",
            "I signed up for the free trial and couldn't hear any sound. I then subscribed for a paid version even though I still had the free subscription, and still no sound coming out from the app. I sent a mail to you yesterday about this and I haven't gotten a response. It's getting really frustrating!!!!",
            "The One-minute Articulation app is an all in one speech app. It introduces vocabulary, allows the student to practice and test fluency of words and word phrases. As a parent it gives you a clear understanding of where your student is verbally and how to help your student communicate.",
            "A very fast, simple and easy yet effective way to train children to say and practice their sounds correctly. My kid loves to see her results and all the sounds she has done! This is a fabulous way to teach speech to children!"

It describes how to say P and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice P with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say P correctly in the word \"pony\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices P by saying \"pants\" while getting dressed, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say P\r\n~Tips on how to teach P to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online P flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying P\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on P for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying P!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

This app describes how to say T and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice T with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say T correctly in the word \"taco\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices T by saying \"teeth\" while brushing teeth, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say T\r\n~Guide on how to teach T to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online T flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach T to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying T\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on T for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying T!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices F by saying \"fork\" while eating, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say F\r\n~Tips on how to teach F to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online F flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying F\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on F for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying F!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",
        "descriptionHTML": "<b>Speech Therapy: F</b><br>Does your child have trouble saying F? We can help!<br><br><b>How This App Works:</b><br>Speech Therapy: F is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say F and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice F with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.<br><br>This app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. <br><br>I was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need.

From a child stricken with\r\nlow-functioning autism, to a senior citizen who has had a stroke and now suffers from\r\naphasia, to someone who has had a tracheotomy or laryngectomy, to someone suffering\r\nfrom MS, Cerebral Palsy, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, brain trauma or legions, or to a person with\r\ndeafness or muteness who wants a convenient way to communicate with people who don’t\r\nknow sign language, VOCALYX can be a life changing tool to those who need it.\r\n \r\nIn short, VOCALYX can compensate for three types of speech problems: vocalization\r\n(for example in the case of throat cancer), language (as is the case for aphasics), and\r\ncommunication (in the case of autism). The principle is simple: you click on an image (a\r\nphoto, pictogram, or text box) within a premade or personalized keyboard, and VOCALYX\r\nsays the message for you through the use of voice synthesis, or with the recorded voice\r\nof either the user or someone close to him/her.\r\n \r\nThe parameters are 100% customizable to meet the needs of all our individual users. This\r\nincludes: the size and number of buttons displayed, the length of button presses (useful\r\nfor people who tremble because of Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s, or MS for example), the\r\nsynthetic voice (age, gender, speed), and there are several different forms of visual\r\ncommunication.\r\n \r\nThere are keyboards made up of pictograms, photos, and prewritten phrases, as well as\r\nABCD and QWERTY keyboards.

            "I personally love this game!!! My baby sister loves it even at 11 months, She loves the concepts pack. She likes the Alphabet one and the Ice Queen pack. I only hate that you have to buy the classics but, Everybody needs to make money❤! So I give this game 5 stars you should to!!",
            "Actually, my daughter loves this game so much that I bought all of the puzzle packs. She's learning words, and tech skills and shapes. But every time you ask for a review, every time the app is opened, she screams. So stop asking, I already bought everything.",
            "My 2 year old Grand Daughter had not shown any aptitude for puzzles and we couldn't find a childs app that she was interested in until Puzzingo. She loves it and is growing in confidence each time she uses it. Couldn't recommend it highly enough. Richard",
            "Love it. It has kept my kids, my nieces, and my nephews (9 kids) entertained. I will probably be using it for my 4th (2 months old) as well when she's older",
            "I bought this on my son's tablet he's learned so much he's delayed in speech and learning he's on the spectrum doesn't understand things quickly but this games has helped him from when he's a 1 ! He's now 6 and he's advanced in so many ways I believe this game helped him from the start he loves puzzles he's so good in that subject he's quick and on point his teacher would say. My daughter plays this game too she's 2 she loves the puzzles she's been talking a lot more clearly listening to this sound we all yell Puzzingo at the end ..

My two year old loves this app and within a week learned most of the words. I love the fact that it is great to use on ipad, vibrant colors, and it is great quality. I think this might be the best app I downloaded in a while.",
            "Pleasantly surprised. My 2 year old loves it.This is a great virtual picture book that has nice colourful illustrations/pictures that are in both English and in our case Spanish.Since we are bilingual family. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a bilingual app for children!",
            "My baby never refuse to play this game!! He plays and also learns new things in multiple languages. The interface also very colourful and attractive to him. This toodler game really teaches the basic things to my baby. I highly recommend it to all.",
            "Excellent application for my baby , I must say. I also appreciate the idea learning with playing. The most important thing is it supports multi language . In one word this toddler game is awesome. I strongly recommend it!"

AST can also be used by older children and adults who have speech sound problems. The app uses pictures that are attractive to children to help them improve their speech sound production and in turn forms an easy home tool to supplement therapy implemented in the clinic which might minimize the duration of therapy and number of visits to the speech clinic. AST includes all the standard speech sounds in Arabic and 84 short syllables (i.e., consonant+ vowel) and includes 252 picture-word stimuli form everyday life. At the beginning of therapy, the speech therapist chooses the target sounds to train the client on in therapy at the clinic. Then, the clinician explains the use of the app to the parents and or client depending on the age of the client to help provide more training opportunities on the target sounds outside the speech clinic. This app can augment what a client is trained on at the clinic which might help accelerate gains in speech therapy. A user can choose the sound to train on by pressing the icon of the sound on the screen and then choosing the desired syllable and then choosing the words that contain the sound.

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*.

Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",

It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "App is decent for online meetings. I use it for group meetings as well as one on one collaboration. It is as good as zoom and some of the other platforms out there. I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "It's a shame that this game doesn't give you the coins you win. Played the daily challenge for 30 days and won the 200 coins, yet I didn't get them. Tried to contact them but the have no direct message. There is no use playing if you're going to cheat me out of the winnings. Also need to work on the words. There have been many words that you say no that are.....",
            "Great game which is addictive, I play this all the time because it is simple yet fun. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because there is one improvement which would be good to see in this game; and that would be an option to change colours of the block and background. Having played the game more 100s of times, seeing the same colours does make it dull. If this small update was implemented, it would make a huge difference.",
            "I am giving this a low rating because of all the ads and the fact that you can get rid of them for 4 bucks but thats just for 30 days. Seriously???? Also the landscape never changes even though in the ad it showed green grass which looked cool. Shame on you devs. Where are the levels in the pictures and trailer? It's a great game but it's the same thing over amd over again.",
            "Not what was advertised when It was an ad, I saw ad and was like woah that looks like a fun little game so I downloaded quickly without investigating, only to find this completely different game so for that I give a 1star. But it's a fun game so 5 star. DO NOT LIKE BEING TRICKED HOWEVER. Shame on you if you're in control of false advertising. But a fun game so I'm conflicted.",
            "The music is peace allowing you to think ,no time presure,which allows you to relax,and the background pic is beautiful. No ads intrupt while your trying to think.So if you like block puzzles I highly recommed trying this one."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

The United Kingdom one sounds so cool but coma at least of the people wanted to go back to The Way It Used To Be. Or nice, and none corrupted. This is a warning if you don't fix it I'm not going to cause any more easily. This app is no longer supporting five stars. And it's so bad now that the voice is sounding so weird call Mum this is my favour",

I tried to get an API key from the Google cloud in order to use the new WaveNet voices, but it is so complicated, I gave up. I look forward to when you will have a separate app for the WaveNet voices. I don't mind paying. But I don't want to go through a thousand hoops to get them from your cloud.",

It would also be cool if the voices sounded like they were \"breatheing\" (when it's the end of a sentences.",
            "I've been using text to speak for years and it's gotten to the point where no matter how clear I speak, it will make up words that do not exist in replacement of the word that I said. For example, if I say the word \"field\" your system will spell it \"feeld\" which is not even a word. Or if I say nightmare, it will spell out \"knight mare\". Actually had the correct two mistakes speaking giving this review which is as ironic as It gets. And that's just one problem. There are so many more. Please fix",
            "I've been using the standard English (UK) female voice, and it's worked well untill today; where suddenly, the voice changed. And it started taking huge pauses after every sentence, regardless of which speed the voice is at. Which is EXTREMELY annoying. I can still use the old version by UNINSTALLING ad relying on the standard bloatware which comes pre-installed on my Samsung device, BUT the blistering thing keeps reinstalling itself every night!

This set up, though just has you on one track that gets harder by the level.",
            "The issue with getting not getting the colored right ball to progress through the level is still happening. Please make the rainbow ball more useful. I'm in the 100s level and these balls with the ? are annoying and unhelpful and makes it harder to get three stars since the last ball on that level keeps changing colors. The balls with the \"-\" are annoying. On the first level with it it's impossible not to pop especially with blaster. Also the previous issues have not been fixed.",
            "Too many interruptions in the middle of a play. Shouldo be able to control the rate of the bubbles. Will not correct my opinion of the game until the ads in the middle of the hand I am playing are curtailed. Extremely rude and inconsiderate of your marketing department to insist on interrupting a game I chose to play. I know how to get new games to load I don't need these interruptions. Will gladly update after I play the revised the game. Thank-you you for your speedy reply."

            "This used to be a decent feature of pixels but now it is so convoluted that it's just a nuisance. It doesn't recognize my voice EVER, not even if I prompt it by swiping. Sometimes it pops up randomly when I'm driving and then it still gets nothing. Microphone issue? Doubtful. Also when it pops up on the bottom it covers the keyboard lol great! The list of negatives goes on and on. Why do I need to \"train\" my google assistant every 2 weeks when it's constantly listening to me anyway? Garbage app.",
            "It's an amazing thing; to have this kind of technology readily available at all times, on a personalized level, and small enough to fit in your pocket... for free. However, Google Now was far superior in functionality. Not sure why the step backwards in this seemingly mandatory \"upgrade\", but regardless, it's pretty amazing. I use \"Ok, Google\" probably 10-15 times a day for all sorts of things. It can even answer some two-part questions, and handles most tasks without the need to intervene.",
            "Yes I have numerous suggestions: 1) is for it to read what I ask it to specifically any text message, new or old. 2). If I'm driving down the road and I ask it to tell me something or read the entire paragraph or whatever I don't want it to stop I wanted to recognize that I'm driving and it needs to tell me that it ignores what I'm asking. 3). It would be nice to refine searches previous ones and edit them. 4). More interactive follow-on conversation option. 5,). Able to diagnose, troubleshoot",
            "This used to be a great app but just recently it stopped working at very random times. For example if I ask \"Show me a picture of Mark Hamill\" it will respond with \"Sorry. I don't understand.\" Also, I use the voice feature all the time and the app has stopped hearing my voice (not all the time but again very randomly). Since I use the app frequently, this has become really annoying. At this point, it's about 50% unusable right now, so if you could fix these issues it would be great.",
            "I'm not entirely sure what's wrong but I've trained it a couple times and it still doesn't respond to me but if I use voice search and Google reads a paragraph to me from the web and it happens to have \"OK Google\" or \"hey Google\" in it, it responds. my voice does not at all sound like the default voice that it uses to read, but it still responds regardless. that's the only time I can get it to respond usually."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Wow. I am hooked. Since I started playing this game early on in the lockdown I got two of my buddies hooked as well. The game helps me build analogies to two story telling (the journey of the colour dots, their character arcs and what not) and strangely I can see parallels to approaching life as the relationship between various dots that occupy every spot on the board.",
            "I have played this game for years. There is a wide variety of levels of different diffculties, shapes and sizes. Game works on a variety of different devices; phones and tablets. Highly recommend as a casual game to help pass some time. At the bmv? Flow. Long line in a store? Flow. Passenger on a long car ride? Flow. Bored with current level set? Go to a different level set, BOOM, continue Flowing. You can Flow anywhere, anytime. I love this game ❤",
            "I absolutely love this game! It's addicting to me. I've played every board, made sure every level was a perfect play, including all the extra packs I unlocked. I really wish there were some new packs for this game. I used to play this game for hours when I was bored. I miss all the nights where it would keep me up at night in bed while my phone was illuminated with Flow. I could think clearly because there were no distractions in bed. The only medal I need to get is the 365 day player goal.",
            "Such a fun and sometimes challenging game. I can and have spent hours playing this game. It's an excellent time killer, and it's really entertaining. I have completed all the levels, and restarting it felt like an entirely new experience. I could go on forever about the variety of levels and how much I enjoy this game, but I won't. Just trust me when I say that I you're into fun and interesting puzzle games, you'll probably like this one! 😀",
            "I love this game, and I have been playing it for years. One thing is that it's great to pass time or just listen to music but still have something to do with your hands. I have the full version, so I'd love it if paid and free packs were uploaded every once in a while (but kind of frequently because you can get through them pretty fast). I know there are other versions with more packs, but I don't want to pay more for every full version. :)"

            "Though the features of zoom is really awesome. I am unhappy to give it 4 stars due to the same video issue. Many people are facing the same problem like me I guess. When my video is on and I go to the participants list, it shows that my video is off. Even the other people cant see my video. That creates a great problem to me during online classes. Please find out a solution to solve this problem. I hope the next updates will make me rate zoom 5 starts.",
            "So yeah, I've facing this problem for 1 month or 2. First it worked good both in mobile and in laptop/computer but now, mobile is facing problem. However, there are 2 problems. 1. It lags so much when my network is excellent and it lags the other apps too. 2. When I switch tabs on my mobile during a meeting, the camera automatically gets switched off and I've been facing this problem from a month or 2. Please fix these problems and I can have a peaceful meeting.",
            "It's a nice app 🙂 it works nicely but the video camera settings is worst . Whenever I use zoom I always turn up my brightness full but this app always show my video null .So I want you to try to fix it . And then zoom is perfect for getting 5 stars. Try to fix it as soon as possible. I hope so you can do it.",
            "This is one of the worst apps. I have used this app for online classes. There are many problems during online classes. The voice of the other participants does not come through clearly in the entire meeting. This app drains the battery very fast. It takes a lot of internet to work. If the network is good even then it does not work perfectly. If I want to open my front camera and unmute myself then I am unable to do these things. The functions in this app are good but the performance is worst",
            "Worked great until for some reason my password was no longer accepted and regarded as invalid. I clicked on \"Forgot Password\" to receive an email that would let me change the password to a new one, but it sent me useless links that lead me to practically nowhere as it says, \"log in to access this page\". Seriously? I clicked \"Forgot Password\" for a reason. If I ask for a password reset, send me what I ask for and not links that lead me to practically nowhere. I missed a lot of important meetings"

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "Don't, just don't. I got into the 4400's for my level, so I played this quite a bit. They even got me to shell out money for the events a couple of times, which no other game managed. 500 characters isn't enough to fully explain why this isn't worth your time. And when I post this,if I get a reply from the company, it will be an insincere copy-paste that screams minimal effort for maximum money grab. You will spend less money if you just buy a mobile game. Also, the deceitful ads are a thing.",
            "Same matching game it always has been. They REALLY need to stop advertising it as a different game. They even went through the trouble of adding an initial level thats like the advertisements and then it goes back to matching gems....they could EASILY create the same style of game with different ways to earn the energy you need to complete tasks. I would love to see them develop a similar game with a play style similar to the click-bait ads they create.",
            "Started off as a very good game, but at level 64 it has become impossible to advance without spending money. Very poor as it reels you in then basically the only way to advance is to spend spend spend. Have tried over 80 times and its the same outcome because you don't have enough turns to complete the level. IF the developers respond I guarantee it will the same stock answer they all use. Very poor indeed. Have now uninstalled.",
            "When you reach a certain level, you are mandated to play a Tournament of Champions. You cannot play the regular game. So if you are in the middle of a game and the game expires before the tournament is over, you loose your points and potential winnings. Some people paid to get coins to play these games which is a huge waste of money. The game designers should either be ashamed of themselves or be sued.",
            "Such a great game. What I like the most about this is that it does not have ads. Not even a single ad since the day I first played it. Such a nice game. Playrix company always make great games. So, this was all its praise. But the reason I gave it 4 stars is that the levels are too hard. Hey hey hey! But not every level. I mean 2/5. And it is specially mentioned there that the levels are going to be difficult. But we can clear the levels by using power ups. This was all my suggestion. Bye."

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",
            "I've been playing ALL the Bubble Witches for years now and I COMPLETELY fell in love with all of them! 🥰 I have a panic disorder and these games help so much to soothe my anxieties and let me focus on the fun! I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened. Also, they don't allow us to use all the words in the dictionary. I know we cant use proper nouns, but there are other words we should be able to use.",
            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

            "I'm not a huge game player... But I like the fact that it doesn't have intrusive ads, and that you can progress through the game at a reasonable pace without hitting any paywalls either. The levels range from easy to somewhat challenging. Although I think some instances I'm still figuring out the rules. ;) I also like the sounds in the game. It's very satisfying. The fish are cute/funny too. I keep the music off though. Lol I really have no complaints about this game. It's fun!",
            "Very Addicting, Very Frustrating The game is cute and a great way to kill time. The explosions and completing levels are extremely satisfying, and I find myself playing for hours at a time. I'm not upset with the whole pay to play thing, as I get it, it's the way these apps make money. But some of these levels can take DAYS to win, and it's like, why am I spending so much time on this? What am I gaining? I just saw a review of a guy who's been playing 4 years to get to level 3K and I'm like nah",
            "Not as advertised! I downloaded because of a facebook ad that looked interesting but was disappointed by how misleading that actually was. I only found out once downloaded that it's basically a glorified candy crush game, with the ad I saw being only a mini game you can sometimes play. They tried to make it interesting by using the coins you earn to decorate an aquarium. But that's not even close to what I was looking to play so after about 10 minutes it was uninstalled due to boredom.",
            "I love the game but becouse i play this game on multiple devices. The game computer red flaged me as a cheater. I am not. I been told by the game makers that they will fix the problem. I am still waiting. The computer thought i was getting multiple boost daily. I was not. But the computer flaged me again. I am getting frustrated. when are going to fix my account.",
            "I'm really disappointed again. I waited about four turns for the last bubble to show up so I could get rid of it and it didn't and I lost after a couple of days of gathering up boosters. I think I'm done trying for a while. twice in a row now I had nine moves left it said but the game stopped me and said my time was over... There weren't any timers that I could see left so something went wrong..."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "it is addicting and lots of fun to play. Never gets old! It gets more challenging the higher you go in the levels. Im nearly to leel 500 and its still fun. has gotten really strategic now in levels 500 and above. Now at level 720, it has become much more difficult and at times can be not so much fun but I seem to stick with it to keep going to higher levels. I will find myself on the same level for a while and then suddenly get it and that keeps me interested. I am in level 958 now",
            "I love this game. The only thing that makes me mad at it is the fact the the fairies are dumb af. I mean instead of helping they just don't... how many times have I lost a level cause there are 3 bubbles, one of them is going to fall, but the fairy still chooses that one... other than that yes. I love the game.",
            "Love it! Been playing over 2 years, lol... and I'm on level 2,433! It's very addicting. I love playing it when I'm bored and in my breaks at work. I also like how they change things up and the bonus levels! Keep up the good work!",
            "Immediately unplayable for me. Every shot makes the screen briefly flash and shake. No idea why games want to alienate anyone with motion sickness, migraines, seizure risk, etc. No reason why you can't have a nice looking game without the constant movement, flashing, sparkling, shaking the screen."

I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "I have played this game for almost two years and on two previous occasions, it has lost all of my progress, and reset itself to the opening level. I started all over, and was up in the 332 level again when it just did the flipping same thing. Not starting over again. Officially done with it and uninstalling tonight.",

Hope you can grant my request, thanks much.",

I had tornado gun at lvl 250 an got the bounce gun, but it only went to lvl 220 an wants items to rank up, but every previous gun would level up to the same lvl of the gun I had. Guess it's a way to try an cheat money out of people...",

Last but not least, you can turn off the music but why do you have to if there is no music at all 🤣 Even after the recent update, the problem still exists",

Health gone but nothing happens. 10min later I was so frustrated and ready end it all, charged towards the boss, then surprise2, a robot came down. The robot damage the boss so slightly it takes 15 min to kill it. Clearly this game made by a brainless zombie"

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: J is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say J and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice J with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say J correctly in the word \"Jeep\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices J by saying \"juice\" during meals, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say J\r\n~Guide on how to teach J to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online J flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach J to your child.\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying J\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on J for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying J!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

My only problem with the app is the fact you can't delete contacts which is quite annoying, I know you can just block and clear them but it isn't that efficient. Please try and fix this as soon as possible. Else this is the best chat app I have ever used. Oh and I recognised a new fault in it, When using the app or web app. It takes time to load on older computers and pcs which takes hours to load due the security.",

In mobile app to the caching of app state is buggy, and hide content on app switch dosent work, all it does is just shows the older app state. there are many more bugs but for the time being it that's the most I want to write. And add a feature to unfriend.",

            "poor quality. you need to call 10 times before being connected. when connected it disconnects very often. But when it works. It is pretty good. Update May 24, 2020 Connectivity has improved although it has nothing to compare with WhatsApp for instance which is very stable. When calls are incoming, you need to open the app in order to take the call; quite annoying. I improved my rating from 2* to 3*. Oct 2020. Brought my rating to 1*",
            "New vertion is not good.From yesterday both camera not clear, blurred video while calling time, two times reinstall, but same. so kindly fix this issue. these days app stops by itself almost every time , Because of this my mobile hangs up and I have to reboot everytime this happens . Hope you fix these kind of bugs in next update . Another problem is that you don't respond to the reviews at all , which is very bad on your part .",
            "The app is good. Using it only because UAE allows VOIP calls through this and 3 other apps. There is a major issues with it's notifications. It doesn't buzz or ring a lot of times. In android it keeps notifying me that BoTim is draining the battery. Network compatibility and clarity not as good as competition. Would be nice to use if the they resolved all the above.",
            "It's a good app , but I would be my honour to give u people some suggestions. The chatting option in this gives a very nostalgic feelings, I hope u could make it a little trendy and then when we share a youtube video it doesn't show the thumbnail. And then I don't think I could backup my chats . I hope u would take my suggestion into consideration. Yours faithfully, Botim user",
            "one of the worst application with following technical issues. 1) Automatic zoom on camera.You wont be able to zoom out the video 2) Add user for multiple video call is not working 3) Getting hung when any other calls received If we compares with whatsapp , facebook , google meet etc...then this application reserves a negative star..."

As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",

            "I've played this game before, and I love it. But now that I've reinstalled it, it isn't loading. Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

Trouble with Google is they want far too much information and personal details. Not going to happen. Tried to find away to get rid,sadly embedded and can't be deleted. Also just let it waste time downloading updates that will never be used . The problem being we will never own our own mobile phone ,there always will be somebody sending files to reduce battery power,apps that spy.",

It works but after a day or so right back to the same issue. I'll answer the video call but the phone continues to ring only on my end. I continue to hit Accept until it stops or I hang up and call the person back.",
            "Just switched over to an Android from an iphone. Video and call quality really make a difference and wanted something just as good as FaceTime. So far, I'd have to say that Duo really comes through and is probably better than FaceTime. I'm sure it helps when the software fully utilizes the hardware on my Galaxy Note20 Ultra, it it doesn't disappoint. Throughout most areas of cell coverage, call quality is good and I'm amazed by the smooth and detailed video quality compared to FaceTime.",
            "This app is perfect for casual video calls. The filters and drawing option is perfect for interacting with kids. I wish the devs would add more fun filters and more interactive options for kids. I love the screen sharing feature as well, but it would be better if you can share the audio as well, and not just the video.",
            "I really want to like this app but when doing video calls the recipient complains of my voice being very \"small or far away\". We know it's not a problem with the hardware because we've been testing and when we use WhatsApp the audio is perfect. Similarly when we use headphones plugged into the 3.5mm jack the audio on duo is perfect. Please review and let me know"

Summon your ships with the USS Discovery and instantly warp around the Galaxy!<br>•\t3 new Discovery officers are beaming into the Galaxy!<br>•\tNew Discovery Missions, Battle-Pass, Avatars and Frames are coming your way!<br>•\tIssues such as mission logs disappearing when the commander does not claim the mission reward, grayed out attack/scan button and many more have been fixed!",
        "comments": [
            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

            "This game is a lot of fun. You build amazing gardens as you pass different levels. But besides that it has a great interactive feature. You can turn on all your street lights and lanterns thru out your gardens, change plants and statues and benches to give each garden a totally different look. I could go on and on. If there are any draw backs it would be getting stuck on some levels for to many days. That gets very frustrating. Overall a really fun way to spend your time",
            "Its actually relaxing. I see everyone commenting about the difficulty. It happens, but too me that's the point. Why would anyone want too play an easy game. I like my mind being massaged and 4 that reason, I will never quit. I'm on level 1850 something. I lost count. Lol. I do agree at times with winning more, but at other times because of my consistency, I get rewarded a lot of boosters too stay in the game. Use them wisely. Create your own strategy and you'll get ahead. Good luck everyone!",
            "Actually pretty fun. Glad I finally tried it after being bombarded with ads. Still don't know how they monetize this game...I've played as much as I want without being prompted to pay for anything. Graphics good even if storyline is a bit corny. UPDATE: ok...NOW I know how they make coin! They get some $10/month or so from me now. I'm hooked & too often stay up far too late \"just to win one more time.\" The deals can be pretty fair though, and I'd like to think playing keeps dementia at bay :)",
            "You know if you wanna win, you gotta have some tricks.. I'm sorry Gardenscapes, but I have to help them folks... Tricks to beat some level... 1. If you had played for several weeks but can't move up a level, try not to log in for a few days... After that long period, try logging in, and see what Austin have in store for you.. I mean, free gift... 😅 2. Try to create as many boosters as you can then if you're lucky those boosters might sit next to each other then you can make a huge blast!",
            "Fun game. If you want to burn some time, it's not bad. A puzzle game with quests. You literally advance to harder puzzles by doing quests. Still playing after 800 levels. It gets harder and you will need more specials like bombs and rainbow wheels to get past the Super Hard levels or you will start to get frustrated as you will need luck on these maps more so than skill."

            "Useless. GPS tracking does not work, tried everything, app usually gets stuck on loading, the features are not user friendly, very limited, very clunky. It's a really slow, limited and badly designed app with inadequate features .",
            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",
            "Can't even log in. It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later. And i could not even log into the app to change for fix anything. And the whole program does not work or link at all with my other son's ipad.",
            "I'm not very happy that Norton does not provide coverage for Microsoft Explorer. Also if you add a website to the unblocked list they are not unblocked immediately. They have a few kinks to work out for me."

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: G is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say G and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice G with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say G correctly in the word \"gorilla\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices G by saying \"go\" while playing cars, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say G\r\n~Guide on how to teach G to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online G flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach G to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying G\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on G for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying G!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

When I sing, I hear my voice but it's to slow for the song. It has a second relapse. You keep updating changes and once upon a time I could fix it. Now I can't. I am not paying my monthly subscription until this is fixed on your side.",
            "Very nice app I don't know singing but this apps sound is loveable and just ossum sometimes the sound of the music helps to sing the next line .when somebody first time install the app the app gives the option of the duet with singer and with the actress ,it helps totally energetic anybody to sing the song .I a teen aged girl ,I love sing different types of songs ,I look for some thing that can help me to sing the song ,then I communicate with my friends and I know that this app is just ossum.",
            "5 stars, much better than Smule in my opinion! The people are so nice, and getting VIP here is so worth it! A bazillion songs to pick from, each one is amazing quality! Thank you for this awesome app! I will add, this app is hard to wrap your head around, but it took me about a day to figure it out.",
            "This app is indeed for singing but sometimes if we wanna sing the songs we like why do we need to become VIP. Can't we just sing without paying money. Coz to become VIP we need to pay. So sometimes it's very annoying. But this app is good too. I have nothing to say more but please remove the VIP system to select the song. It is so frustrating.",
            "I have no idea what happened.... The song lyrics have been cut like a lot... And usually there are a report button but I cant seem to find it at all and I believe that you take it out... So please please fix it... I love your app, i been using this app for long time already! Please do something about it"

        "description": "Speech Therapy: N\r\nDoes your child have trouble saying N? We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nN is one of the first sounds a child learns how to say. When he/she doesn't say it correctly, it can be frustrating! To ease this frustration and provide parents with all the tools they need, we created Speech Therapy: N. Speech Therapy: N is a comprehensive app designed by an ASHA certified, practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say N and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice N with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say N correctly in the word \"north\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices N by saying \"nighty night\" while playing house, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say N\r\n~Tips on how to teach N to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online N flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying N\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on N for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying N!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "I love this app! My grandson absolutely loves playing this, there are so many learning tools in every game they have. If you want a great learning app for your littles I highly recommend Wonster Words, my grandson has been playing this app since he was two, he's now three and still loves it!",
            "This was much better when we first got it, 2-3 years ago. We have paid for the app. Biggest issue right now: I am really disappointed with the pop up request for a survey which you can only get rid of by agreeing to be redirected to a web page. You should be able to press around the box to get rid of it without being redirected but can't. My daughter is too old for it now, but my son still enjoys it. However, I think it now has LESS educational value than when we first got it and I am considering deleting the app. There are better apps out there if you want educational content. This is an ok app if you mostly want to distract the kid while they MIGHT learn something.",
            "Unimpressed; I see little educational value in this. I did the 7-day trial subscription, and all I see is repeated shape-matching - you don't really have to listen to the sounds or anything; it's just matching shapes. It basically just gives you an outline of a letter, you drag the matching letter to it, then it gives you another one. Am I missing something?",
            "This app is a fun way of learning soo many things especially phonics, alphabet and so on. This is so good my kids loves it a lot. They can't have enough of it at all times. Thanks to the developer 🤩🥳🤩",
            "Amazing app. Very cool games. Fun for kids and still educational"

            "I loved this app before the recent update!!! Before you could practice for hours and actually get somewhere with your learning. You could make mistakes and it would push you to get it right and that was so encouraging and rewarding and you felt like you were getting somewhere. Now with the hearts, as soon as you make 5 mistakes, thats it, end of session. Awful and very deflating. Yes I could pay to upgrade, but thats £7 a month, over £80 for a year!!!! Very very disappointed.",
            "Fix the problem when we change email, the app keeps remembering the previous email. Create the option to delete courses or organize them by preference. The heart system is terrible, remove it. The application has too many bugs for silly things, it does not load the option to follow, sometimes the audio doesn't work. I don't uninstall it because they asked me to use it at school, but this app is terrible.",
            "I can only recommend the Desk Top version of Duolingo, and even that is marginal. The mobile app is cumbersome and frustrating with having to earn and buy errors, unless you spring for the Pay version. Their slogan used to be \"Make learning fun and free.\" Wll, let me tell you, the new Hearts system is not fun. And, I think their new update is solely intended to make people buy the Plus version. Also, both versions have some of the silliest sentences to translate. Why learn them if they have no purpose? I think there are better, more efficient ways to learn a new language.",
            "The recent update to this app has made things unacceptable. The introduction of a 'hearts' system (when you get 5 things wrong in a row, you can't progress for the rest of the day) is anathema to the process of learning. What's more, I'm relatively sure the developers changed the accepted fields of words for answers smaller (phone is no longer an alternative to 'cell phone', an Americanism used nowhere outside of the United States). This is to push users into buying a subscription. Awful.",
            "Very disappointed with the update to the heart system. It's to slow people down? Then just limit the number of lessons per day instead of hearts, but allow unlimited practice sessions. I'm learning nothing now because it feels like a test and I get too much anxiety with those. Mistakes are NORMAL when learning a new language!

            "Loved the game from I started to play it. It has taught me patience, respect for others, base designing, to reach your goal which is Masters League im at 3045 trying to get to 3200. This game has just been a big impact in my life. I absolutely love the hero skins. In my opinion Clockwise Queen, P.E.K.K.A King and the Pirate Warden. Now let me talk about what I think you need to improve on is the Builder Base I honestly think that you guys need to look at that side more. In my opinion the walls are way to expensive it takes to long for me to upgrade them. Now lets talk about the normal side now. I think you need to work on people getting attacked and losing a lot of trophies I used to lose 20 to 35 trophies back when I was a TH9 and I couldnt reach Masters League so I decided to upgrade mt TH and I loe 10 to 20 trophies now because I found an anti 1 star. But besides that I love the fact that this game is so old and its not dying and hopefully will not. But thats it for me. GOOD LUCK!!!",
            "One of the greatest games of all time. Clash of Clans was a childhood favorite of mine. Combining amazing gameplay with the ease of playing in your phone, anywhere and anytime, Clash of Clans is the lovechild of some of the best classic CRPG and RTS games. Clash of Clans has an addictive nature, and the game runs flawlessly on almost any device. Battles are exciting and intense, base building is very fun and limitless. You can play the game any way you want - there are no limitations. 5/5.",
            "The game is still Good, no complaints about it. But i do have a suggestion, its about the clan. Why not add a section where we can see who is active in the clan even if were not in game friends. Cuz it'd be a hassle if everyone would have to add everyone that ever joined the clan, which would be kinda confusing i think. Especially for the Lead, and coleads managing the Clan. Cuz in our case, not everyone uses the clan chat when they should. So i was hoping you could possibly consider this?",
            "Sucks !!! After the last update it sucks !!! All my training time for troops is gone back to the time when I unlocked them for example I've upgraded my dragons to the level where they took 3 minutes to train after the update they're taking 3 minutes !! And it's not only the dragons and also not the only bug !! It has ruined the total experience !! And also it's Clan war league going on !! Supercell what have you done !!😒😡 And yeah your in game help and support center sucks even more !😡 Fix it",
            "Love the game came back after 2.5 years and a lot has changed since then. New things have been introduced like th12 and th13 new troops. Graphics are also improved. 4 star because me and my friends are having a glitch since our native language is not english we type in hindi using english alphabet and the game converts in astriks like ****. this pls fix it its really annoying. Rest is fine . Thank you."

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: TH is a comprehensive app that describes how to say TH and then how to teach your child how to say TH. You will learn how to systematically practice TH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say TH correctly in the word \"thimble\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices TH by saying \"the\" during a structured reading task, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say TH\r\n~Tips on how to teach TH to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online voiced and voiceless TH flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning and reading at first. Then, you just have to carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying TH\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on TH for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying TH!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "I received a mini microphone as a gift and it's instructions were to download a karaoke app. I tested it out and it worked well. I just need to use the app more.",
            "Besides Fairytale in Malay, I did not find any Chinese song I was looking for. Nor does the application have all the National Anthems. Got this app & within 10m it did not meet expectations. First reaction when scrolling through categories was that there was KPOP. Initial Instinct was there were INTL songs. When I searched for more INTL songs there wasn't one. This is not \"Unlimited\" as the title says. A Premium Account is needed to unlock some songs & there are none Chinese songs that I found.",
            "It is a very good singing app! But to listen to yourself sing costs real money most of the time.. And when I sing the voice isn't always clear.",
            "This is so much fun!!! I cant sang! But I'm having a ball trying 🤣🤣🤪. The only thing is for a person who's not on here a lot and singing for fun $19.99 is a lot to be asking for to have access to popular songs..😩🤔. But truly I'm excited about this app! Needs a $5.99 or even $9.99 what I pay for iMusic but have unlimited access to. Something to think about.",
            "I love this cuz I can like I can sing songs do whatever I want I can sing so many songs you should download this it doesn't had that it doesn't even have those many ads you should download it you really should so I'm telling you you should really download it."

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

            "Best Way strategy game I would give it 5 stars, if not for this few things I wish the developer would add very soon 1. A way to vote out a clan leader: some leaders can't access their game accounts anymore. So they begin afresh, but resuming their leadership role becomes impossible, so they and clan members are force to abandoned clan cos of inactive leader. Please make it easier to change leaderships in clans to save clans 2. Please include clan battles and gold sharing. Thanks",
            "I like the game but if you could just buy the game and pay for updates i think i would spend money. The way its set up its like a never ending nickle and diming. And whoever pays gets more advantages which isnt really strategic so much as pay to win. Also, i feel like im playing a computer many times even when it says im playing wifth or against another person... i dont know. Also, it doesnt take much strategy for someone to sit in their base and develop a nuke (sPaCe StRiKe) and just blow U up",
            "Great game once you get to level 7 where skirmishes are avaliable this game is a real rts but its not for a casual player as game play is slow do you need time to invest. This is a pay to win and things are expensive but you can also invest time and get the things another (research) production queue would be great devs also but please don't miss out on this game its very good once you get into it. Thanks",
            "Game doesn't load after its open, I am done waiting and unsitalling it right now. I used to love this game a lot but now this issue has killed the vibe, i would appreciate the developer team to fix it as soon as possible. Really want to play it again Just because of this issue i have given it 1 star",
            "The game is good and the graphics also.. but for now i just give a 4 star.. i wish that you can fix a minor problem that i encounter like sometimes the troops dont know where to go when i ordered them.. they just walking to somewhere dead end area."

Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

When he/she doesn't say it correctly, it can be frustrating! To ease this frustration and provide parents with all the tools they need, we created Speech Therapy: M. Speech Therapy: M is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say M and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice M with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say M correctly in the word \"mask\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices M by saying \"more\" while playing blocks, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say M\r\n~Tips on how to teach M to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online M flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying M\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on M for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying M!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "This is very addictive for me, so I must limit my time playing. When I win prizes of extended free time playing, I really wish it would go to game options (as with the boosters voices) so I can use it on my schedule. Last night, I got a one hour free games on the last intended game for the evening. I did play a bit longer, but not the full time.",
            "Sometimes l feel like the game is too hard and rigged against the player. I don't mind hard, l just don't enjoy impossible. I don't understand the value or purpose of all of the icons, likebear heads, belts, etc. Can they be used for extra turns? I don't what the points are used for in the game. I need more information.",
            "Against my better judgment I updated the app this weekend...I was at level 1067, after the update I was at 0. Did the log in to Facebook thing and it got me back to 1067. But now the game doesn't work. Only thing I can do is the mini game trying to get 3stars(added).few days later.. I decided to try and play on facebook to see if it would jumpstart the game on my phone and it worked.",
            "Alot if times I'm on a level for weeks. It's due to the game itself not giving me the colors I need. I could have 7 balls left and only need one color to win, and it never gives it to me, only weeks later. That's my only problem with the game. Other wise I spend alot of free time playing. Love this game!!!!",
            "I'm very disappointed in the game makers, I have no problem with the game myself but my partner who suffers from mental health uses this game as an outlet to help her through her day. However she cannot currently play her game as her new phone screen is too narrow, she submitted a review here ages ago but as yet the makers seem more bothered about Halloween themes.. I can see that many other players across the globe are having the same issue.. btw your link is not copyable"

            "I have problem with recording my voice. After I recorded my voice played with increased tempo than the music and the sound wasn't clear. At first I thought it was my headset but after I used 3 different headset I still have the same problem. When I used another phone with different series there was no problem with them. My phone is Samsung A21s.",
            "This used to be a fine app but out of nowhere it stopped uploading my songs, each song crashing at 60% mark while uploading. In spite of complaining to the developers several times they took no heed of my issue. I have lost more than 10 songs while uploading so far in spite of trying several first aid measures like clearing cache, reinstalling the app. This especially bothers me because I'm a VIP member. The developers don't seem to care much for their users. Use at your own risk.",
            "Hi my experience with the app was bad, it's been a week that I am not able to use the starmaker properly because I am not able to hear what I sing on party rooms or what I talk on the live even after enabling the voice back to headphone option, I've also enabled the mic and storage options also.. I even tried connecting with all the three headphones of mine which are wired, wireless n and Bluetooth enabled but the experience, hasn't really changed it is completely audio less to me..",
            "Always loading, i dont know why. I' ve been recomend many time as a PartyGuru, i have a lot of covered song, everyday i do collab and daily task. 4,000 fallowers, level of Partyroom. But still no aproval on my recomendation. While the others, i saw always on private no to much collab and covered. But you give the V tag as virified Singer. How is it possible. And for the popular list.. I dont understand why, some users are still no stage name,only Id's, have 6 gift only totaly newby in Starmaker",
            "Dear starmaker team, I am here to tell u about the issue regarding song post.So there is an issue whenever I post the song that I am not able to post any of the song.Even If I try to post them the system is saying \"failed to post\",so please try to get my difficulty.

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

In this update we improve the call blocking experience for users on Android 10 (“Android Q”) and higher: incoming calls that you wish to block will now be blocked completely, and not forwarded to voicemail! You can enable this behavior by setting Hiya as your default caller ID app. Please let us know of any feedback regarding this change. We also squashed some bugs and ensured things are running smoothly overall.",

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

Doesn't compketely replace the actosr face to resemble your face. Some of the clips seem like they do not change a bit. Is there a way to better the consistency of the refacing? If so, then I would give the app a 5 star rating. Thank you",

Had I paid for the full version, I could have been sleeping most of the night but I had to support the app by watching 30 second ads before each reface. 2. I get the ads but maybe not before each reface, maybe every other one. At least change the ads up a little. Most of the time you're watching the same ad like that's going to make me buy the product.

This app isn't ideal for what I need as I was hoping it would help show how you should make the sound or form it and play back how I sound. Instead it has you say the word and passes you if it can recognize what you're saying or not. It's cute. Fun for my son to play with, but not helping well with my speech."

You will learn how to systematically practice CH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say CH correctly in the word \"chipmunk\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices CH by saying \"cheeseburger\" while eating dinner, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say CH\r\n~Tips on how to teach CH to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online CH flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning and reading at first. Then, you just have to carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying CH\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on CH for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying CH!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

And please brings some space ship that can be buy with germs which are used to combine two spaceship in order to make new improved spaceship. I have played it and love it but most of the time events are based only on shopping like buying ship in discount or something other. You don't need to bring any events like this. Also all those things can be bring within shopping section. So please thinks about it once. Thank you.",
            "Good fun game at some point. BUT...... microtrasaction are out of this world. 50 bucks for a 30 days subscription and so on. if you want to be competitive and don't mind spending hundreds of dollars, you can play this. Ps. you can get some stuff for free, but you are going to spend hours watching ads. Example to get a free ship you have to watch over 40 mins of ads to unlock it.",

On behalf of Subs, and many others, stop giving false promises of rewards. Only play this game if you want to be lied to and support a company with no ethics. Join me in not being paid to give a 5 star review to a company and tell how you've been taken advantage of and your time wasted.",
            "Ive played quite a bit since the plague started. I had 7 or eight ships that were upgraded in the different stats. I also had several side guns also upgraded. After the latest update several of my ships and side guns can no longer be selected. Inworked really hard to get the money and gems and what not for those ships and upgrades. What happened to take them away? I would give 5 stars because i love the game that much. But taking all my ships? My wakanda ship? Wth? Edit: Fixed within a day!!",
            "I absolutely love this game, I play it 24/7, But I'm confused as to Why all of a sudden it's not allowing me to play due to a pop up saying, TimeOut!!!!, May someone please tell me what is wrong, I brought in over 30 friends to download this game an they don't see it but me..They are all wanting to delete it like myself may I please have an explanation as to why it's saying this ONLY on the partners section only🤔🤔🤔🤔"

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

            "I mean, really just a stellar game. No real need to pay to win, good music (if it's to your taste), pretty smooth animation (in th later updates), very rewarding. Outside of the game itself, the fanbase is generally really nice, it has a respectable presence on the internet, and the creators very actively interact with the players. There's more to say, but the top reviews pretty much say it all. I reccomend just getting the game and trying it out. Also, would reccomend the prequel, Dawn of Fire",
            "Great game, I have only played for a little bit and all ready love it. The progression is fast enough so you don't get bored an microtransactions are optional. I love the idea of your monsters making music and it adds a whole new level of wanting to get more monsters rather than a game that just let's you look at them. At least give this game a try.",
            "I love this game, and I have a few ideas that would make this game SO MUCH BETTER! All I ask is that you respond to me because I would love to get your opinions on these! First, I think when looking through islands in the friends thing, and of course composer songs, you should add a search for artists and the names of songs. That would be a lot faster and easier. Second, I feel like you should add more monsters in the market on the composer island. Maybe trumpits, and add the Ghast as well. Thx!",
            "This has to be one of the best games ever made. So creative to make singing monsters and put it into one perfect game. The free diamond offers actually worked for me, and then got Epic Noggin and Epic Punkleton in less than one hour using the diamonds! I got really lucky that time! Im rating this five stars and nothing can change that. I highly recommend you play it.",
            "Really clever and well-done. You can tell the game designers put a lot of effort into the game. I bought a small pack of gems ($1 worth) several years ago that removed ads and opened up the option for some additional structures. That was a dollar well spent to support a game that's more than earned it, and my only purchase to date. I appreciate that although they make it well worth it to make a purchase, it's far from necessary to enjoy and do well. (Hint: patience + mini mines = diamonds)"

            "Starting out giving the game five Stars. So far okay. We shall see. The graphics in the game are so so just okay not that great. It's like all the other Google app store games if you want to play you're going to have to pay. And you know what! I really don't mind paying a developer real money if the game is really good and really fair and no cheating and no game fixing. Unfortunately ! Most games on Google are letting alot of players cheat ! I hate losing to a p o s cheater .",
            "Good graphics, decent gameplay but....it's set up too make you lose. Fake bot players programmed to make you win in the beginning and then once you're hooked after a few wins, you start losing. That concept is called pay-to-play. As you lose, unsurprisingly, cue the ads to buy more in-game coin. I'm not naive, I know it's a model used by most games but here it's so obvious it dulls the game. There are better bowling games out there that at least allows you to enjoy the gameplay.",
            "Bowling King is very fun but you might ask why did I give it a four-star because you could accidentally Mash something and buy it but what is really cool like some other game you have to buy a lot but in this game you can watch an ad get diamond cash coins this app is really cool and I encourage you to get it it's totally free unless you want to buy chips hope you like it.",
            "This game has been acting up for the past month. The configuration is way off! First, it changed the color of my lane...just like that! Unable to change it back. Then you can't maneuver the ball correctly. If you aim the ball either to the left or right, that's an automatic gutter ball. Please fix whatever's going on!! I love this game and I would hate to delete it!",
            "What an exciting and enjoyable APP that is realistic and challenging. Thank you. It's always a pleasure using this bowling APP. I have tried other bowling apps and always come back to this one. Thank you for the GREAT entertainment. Back for more fun. Thank you!"

        "description": "Speech Therapy: R\r\n\r\nR, the dreaded R! The R sound is one of the most difficult sounds to pronounce in almost any language! Many children have difficulty saying it correctly, but don't worry! We are here to help your child today.\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: R is an all inclusive app that teaches you how to say R and then how to teach and cue your child how to say the sound. We will then walk you through how to systematically practice R in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say R correctly in the word \"rake\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices R by saying \"more\" while playing blocks, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say R\r\n~Tips on how to teach R to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say R and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say R correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online R flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying R\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on R for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for R even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

For example, a child may say R correctly in the word &quot;rake&quot; while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won&#39;t say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....<br><br>On the other hand, if a child practices R by saying &quot;more&quot; while playing blocks, carryover of progress is likely to happen!<br><br>This articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!<br><br><b>What&#39;s Included:</b><br>~Explanation on how to say R<br>~Tips on how to teach R to your child<br>~A video showing exactly how to say R and explaining common errors<br>~A variety of cues for helping your child say R correctly<br>~Word lists<br>~Picture Flashcards<br>~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level<br>~Online R flashcards<br><br><b>What you can expect:</b><br>This app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! <br><br><b>Who should use this app:</b><br>~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying R<br>~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover<br>~Children who have been working on R for a long time!<br>~Children who don&#39;t qualify for speech services for R even though they have trouble saying the sound!<br>~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips<br><br><b>Who made this app:</b><br>This app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don&#39;t always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. <br><br><b>Enjoy!</b><br><br>This app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "Not a huge fan of the battle mechanics.. the story is great, each character seems detailed.. my only quam is that I've done easily over 100 pulls for new characters and have pulled the same 10 blue tier the whole time. Not a single purple or yellow besides the one they gave for free. Quite sad to of spent money for literally nothing. I know it's all chance, but I personally wont be attempting this again.",
            "If there is a single game that I have enjoyed thoroughly through the years and have never been frustrated with, its sdorica! From the music to the story (which is a 12/10!!!) You cannot go wrong, give it a try!",
            "Im giving this one star because while I adore this game I can only play on wifi. I have a good 4g connection on my galaxy s9 plus and it keeps asking for a stable connection. Please fix this its terrible and straight up ruins the game for me. Ill delete this post and give back my 5 stars once this is resolved.",
            "The game is beautiful, i've playing for a long time now. But today is different. After i open the app and tap to start, it went pitch black and never showing the game. Please fix this, and i will give you back my 5 star",
            "I dont usually do reviews so I'll keep it short because this company deserves something for its hard work and after playing for almost two years this game is probably had one of its biggest updates just recently so its clear that they really do care about this game and want to keep it revelant and entertaining, and I really mean that despite sounding like a review bot."

            "If google would fix the audio issues, this so would be great, but if the volume level is going to continue to be a crappy mystery as to what level it'll be when I plug into my truck, then the app gets 2 stars. 95% of the time when I plug in the sound is instantly a quarter of my Bluetooth volume. As it is though, I'd rather do without it than deal with the headache. To the 'developer' that linked the forum, you should check it yourself, this has been posted for years and still not fixed",
            "Great when it works, lately it's been struggling to connect and randomly just disconnects. At first I thought it was my cable/ charger port, but now realize it's actually the app. When first connecting, it's been pulling up and them immediately closes out, or it'll show the icon on the screen and play the music, but it'll never open up. I have to keep unplugging and replugging to get it going. After a few tries it works.",
            "10/28/20 Still not very helpful. Should be so much easier, truly. It's like it's all there but not easy or even polished looking. None of the normal controls work to make selections, so it's all touchscreen. This is not safe, especially since one must often go back and forth between apps since only one app's info can be displayed at a time. The phone itself does a much better job, also because one can have that in a holder within closer reach. Also, assistant is hit or miss.",
            "Ok, I love the interface and how easy it is to use. I have an older car, so I don't have a screen in my dash. This makes it easy to control my music, use GPS, and the other things I choose to see. Plus using it with Google Assistant makes it 100% hands free. HOWEVER It turns on at weird times, I can't get it to only come on when it syncs with my car bluetooth, so I've had to take it completely manual to connect. Which would be fine if it didn't STILL activate for no reason. Grrr.",
            "It doesn't even work anymore. I put in a destination, it routes it, but then the blue dot that represents me stays at the starting point of my travel. The map never progresses past the starting point. GPS is enabled on my phone and the location permission is enabled in settings. I'm angry. I'm on a Pixel 2 running Android 11. My car is a 2016 Subaru Legacy."

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",

I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",

It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

            "This app was good a couple years ago. But in the last couple years it has gotten worse and worse. It's always trying to sync and never does. This app needs to be redone. I like that I don't have to listen to every single message. I can visually see who the message is from. I like being able to erase certain messages without having to listen to them every time. This could be a great app if you would FIX the problems. Seems like everyone has the same issues. I've been with metro for about 10yrs.",
            "Keeps sending me messages that say the app is \"running\" and the app will not synchronize properly. VERY ANNOYING. Metropcs can't figure it out. Tried getting them to fix the problem three times but they don't know how to do it!!! Will probably have to uninstall the app, lose all of my archived messages and pic's and reinstall to see what happens. Also, NEVER set your permissions to ALL! Doing so will let messenger change your contact list, phone call information, distributes private info also!!",
            "I n hoping this update haz fixed all its snags, it wont sync, it leaves a tickertsape note acrossmy phobe staging it \" keeps trying to connect to uou ,but cant get thru\"! Now i tried getting on the app on my phone but after setting my new passcode per the apps request , and using my phones last 4 numbers like suggested by app! Then it wouldnt accept the phones numbers, i have to call my phone to get into my VM\"s so the app really is worthless! Lets jooe it has been fixed or im dropping it!",
            "I used to be able to delete old VM's, multiple at a time. I don't have to listen to them but I have to click on each one individually and delete it. Why can I no longer select more than one and delete messages I know I don't need to listen to?",
            "Always been great visual voicemail. Where can I locate the 2020 update version? I received a text message from Metro to get the update. Thank you. Susanne"

Its a game to kill time. I love it sooooooooo much👌👌😊😊 its better than other games and its name is also very very good. It contains new bottles and new stuff.I vl always give it 5 stars Regards Maiyra Narang",
            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. Super-Realistic graphics, (as the name itself says, 3d), the outdoor one is really cool. There are no bigs, but the ads are bugging. Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up 👍👍",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Bottle flip 3D it is such a good game it's like it's so addicting but there is one downside to it there's no way that you can like play together cuz me and Avery like to play and we wish there was a way that you could like do it together or there was a leader board or scoreboard or something just so that we could know if you are good at the game and there's not a lot of ads and I really love this game so please can you like make a bottle for 3 2 or can you make a upgrade ☆☆☆☆☆♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ good job!!!",
            "It is a good game but way too many adds! AND level 63 is in possible to beat I think I tried it about 26 or even more times. 😡 My advice don't waste your time and data on the continues for levels in the 50s or 60s. 🤔 Hopes this helps people who have read this information 😁 bye peeps! 👋😎"

            "I have never quit a game the same day i started it, until now. And odds are more money is made by the ads than the players. I was excited when i started playing too many bugs and bad choices by the devs or management however.",
            "Predatory gambling and political ads ruin what could have been a fun experience. Edit - Cookie cutter reply from Devs fails to address my concerns. Gameplay is good, predatory ads for malware or gambling are not.",
            "Beginnings are fun, but later it's unplayable for free users. Too many ads, repetitive, unjust, unfair. At some point, progressing is limited to paying customers, upgrading your ships above certain levels is available only after buying crystals or cards. You don't receive enough of them during normal game. Ads can break the sound in the game, and pause your music. Free users are limited to 20 games at a time. Then you need to wait for energy to replenish.",
            "I updated the app to this latest version and lost all my ship and drone upgrades!!! That sucked biiiiiiiig time and deserved 1/5. 🌟 But the compensation received in the in-app mail was more than enough and deserves a 5-star rating...have your 5/5 🌟 as a sign of gratitude from yours truly."

            "UPDATE2: As of 10/23/20 the game still won't load while online. It crashes at startup. Not fun. I even tried reinstalling. Didn't fix it. *** Great game - a little easy for about the first 100 levels, but nice light brain exercise. If I was to change anything I would suggest that it be possible to go back and play old levels. Right now once you've conquered a level you can't go back and play it again, which means this game is virtually offline between updates.",
            "Way too easy. And way, way too many ads. I had to play on airplane mode so i wouldn't get an ad after EVERY level. I understand that the developers need money to pay their employees but an ad every 10-15 seconds is ridiculous. Before I turned on airplane mode I was spending more time watching ads than playing the game.",
            "10/19-The game itself isn't bad. Need to make the screen to when you scroll down it stays there until you scroll back up Especially in Gold Mode. Every time I scroll down it goes up while I'm creating a path. Its cost me several retries. And cut down on the ads. After every single level or retry is ridiculous....Or lower the adless version to 1.99. 10/20-Obviously you dont read the reviews, 'cause if you did you would see, that I made suggestions here!",
            "Unlike a lot of games there advertising out there this really is a puzzle game and it's very cute. so far I don't find it very challenging but it is a lot of fun. I'm hoping it gets more challenging as we go along there are several different puzzle games included in this and I find it as well worth downloading there are a lot of ads but you can deal with that",
            "There are a lot of games that are exactly the same, so 0 points for originality, graphics are the bare minimum, kinda cutesy style. The most aggravating part is that the game is ridiculously easy, I'm on level 20 something and a toddler could solve these, plus you can't skip levels without watching ads. Obvious cash grab is obvious"

            "A good strategy game, not too mechanically complex and decently challenging. A treat for fans of the series. Most of the negative reviews are people upset about being able to buy things. Look, all free games want your money. But FEH is pretty generous with what you get for free, has no ads, is from a trusted name, and no game mode is behind a pay wall. You can build up a deep bench of heroes and be competitive in PVP modes and never spend a single dollar.",
            "FEH is unfortunately plagued by many issues. If you're like me, and play for the characters you love, you won't have fun. I've spent hundreds of hours (and real money) collecting and upgrading my favorites, just for them to be outclassed by whatever new OP 5* of the week gets released. You have to pull a character 11 times to max out their power, ridiculous. It's all up to luck if you get the characters you want, and even if you do they'll probably suck. Play Three Houses instead.",
            "I love this game, and there is a ton of stuff to do in it. The amount of free orbs (the real money currency) you get seems to be decent. While I have some minor balancing issues with the game, the main reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the limit on inventory. There are 580 characters; why do we only get 300 slots before having to spend orbs? This has not changed since the launch of the game as far as I'm aware. I feel like we should have free slots equal to the # of different units",
            "As someone who spent 2 thousand on this game, i feel qualified to say: I cant believe advanced wars died to this franchise. Power creep. Bloated summoning pool. Terrible features. Predatory mechanics to spend money. If you like this stuff, then this is the game for you. Dont speak to me ever again, intelligent systems. Hit me with a generic automated response and ill hit ya with a KleanYoSelf",
            "Very fun and rewarding. Purchases are not needed for good characters but I do it anyway because the prices are actually reasonable. Edit: I was actually getting a new player new character summon boost I wasn't aware of back then. It is a little hard to get the characters you want without spending money, and sometimes even still so with spending, but if you are a Fire Emblem fan, it is still a very fun, challenging, and rewarding game."

            "Fun Game, Too Many Ads. Finished a level? Watch an ad. Don't want an ad? Here's one anyway. Here's another ad, I didn't skip the last one fast enough. Way too much. I timed it and for every 2 minutes of actual gameplay, I had 3 minutes 48 seconds of total ads",
            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

            "I have used this app for years and loved it. I loved the background themes the most. But since the update, nothing works right. I've been noticing that I'm not getting messages in real time. They come much later and sometimes only if I open the app to check. When I get off a call, which should have nothing to do with the text app, there's a blank text screen on the page with a huge ad at the bottom. I'm looking for a new app. This one no longer suits my style.",
            "The new update is horrible. I try to text and it blacks out my text window so its hard to see. It shoves a ad the size of a third of you screen which tries to get you to accidently hit it, which then erases your current text. Between the ad strip on top and the large banner ads on the bottom this app no longer is fast and easy to use. To slow dodging ads.",
            "Not sure what happened since the last update, but now when i send a message, i get a failed to send error, after the green dots go back and forth for a while. I never get the green check. I have had to go back to my old sms client to keep from getting this error. Back to the same issue after this update.",
            "I used to love this app, but I HATE the new style that came with the most recent update. Now, now matter how small the font is, when you're typing a text it will only allow two to three words on each line and it breaks up long words even though there's plenty of space in the bubble. This makes it really hard to proofread your texts. Also, I can never reply to 5 digit text numbers and the developers have not helped me fix this. Currently looking for a new app.",
            "To walk from, or even past an app like this I couldn't do so. How awesome it definitely is, does remain on five with me. But only do I request one thing; if having either a modified or simply rain-based theme. Alongside the hopes of having a rain theme, I also was going to mention that while typing the texts, why our words don't cover the entire area while doing so now? Could that be fixed as well. Thank you."

            "It is a good game but has its quirks. The bone pile is hidden during play and only visible when you draw from it. If you're not careful and hold the piece while you're placing, it, it will go to the closest matching piece. When the game is over, it covers the board so you can't review the game. Scoring is puzzling, for instance; our team score was almost 8000 and overnight dropped more than 2000 points. There is no way to remove deadbeat or caustic players from the team.",
            "Love the game, the colors and play of the game is nice. but there is an error with this app...Whenever there is a draw, the computer automatically gives the round to the opponent/computer. Also, tap-to-play causes misplays. This app can be better by:. 1) Showing how many bones are left in the boneyard. 2) allowing online play with other humans. 3) making a 3-player, and 4-player option. 4) add a carribean style play mode, where you don't win by points but after a set number of games one.",
            "Needs updates bad! The boneyard play is awful. Whether it is in my favor or not, it is ridiculous how this one pull gets the exact domino needed for an advantage, it is frustrating when you strategize to send your opponent to the yard and for them to only pull one bone nearly everytime and it's usually the exact one needed. I would be here all week describing the scenarios that I've witnessed, but overall it seems like the game leans in favor of the player of it's choice. IJS",
            "Downloaded this game as something to help me wind down (and at first it was) but, with all the updates, it's turned into a constant source of frustration. The scripting is so obvious I can guess what domino the computer will play without even seeing their dominoes. This game has gone very downhill very quickly.",
            "I've been playing this for about a year and have begun to notice that there are about 8 - 10 games that continually repeat, it's like being in \"Groundhog Day.\" I didn't notice this at first, i thought it was random shuffling, but am seeing it more frequently for the last month or so... Today the game played first, starting with a 3x6 domino, then on its second play it played a double 6! Very frustrating!

            "Tempo doesn't work correctly. It's acknowledged as a 'preference' in the help section. It's not a preference. It's math. Edit: 10/30/2020. I've given you an actual proof for why your app is dysfunction and inaccurate. Still no response. As a reminder, 1/1 @ 400bpm != 8/8 @ 400bpm. This decision saved your developers a lot of memory, but it made the app dysfunctional. 👎",
            "The app is great and recent firmware works great with the watch. But unless I turn on GPS it won't send notifications. Clearly not a connection issue since the metronome works perfectly with GPS turned off... If you want to collect all the data just require google account but don't burn my phone battery for notifications access",

            "Don't install this app, this is just a ludicrous way to waste your money. The app takes your coins whether a call starts or not. It requêtes stupendous amount of coins to call people you're already chatting with, some of the people there feel like bots, it keeps matching you with people that aren't ready to talk while cutting your coins at the same time until it gone. It is so clear that the developers are trying to eat your cash. You've been warned!",
            "Nice and easy app, around 90% is real, at times i have faced fake accts, especially when you select girls only, mostly the first 2 ppl are fake, but Not always. But my main concern like most of the users is price that you have to pay for coins. The price should be reduced by 60-70% so we can use it freely without worrying about cash and in this way the app itself would be able to earn much more, the mangmt of this app should consider this and apply reducd prices for 2 weeks and see the results.",
            "I would give this a 0 star, a this should be shut down rating, they say you can video call for free, no you can't, it costs more to video than anything else in the app, it will cost you 120 coins per minute meaning if me and my bff were video call on this it would cost us £254 for one day, that for all the Americans out there is $300 for 1 hr of video call, change this now or you will have a lawsuit put against you for false advertisement, it is because of this that I can't talk to sum1 I met",
            "Just like every dating app there has to be a free dialogue between users without having to pay atleast 20 free messages. But asking me to pay before any service is pure evil. And Again please where is the log out menu???? It's missing and I need it as soon as possible. Thanks please 😢😢",
            "Hello.. I have a big issue.. please this is seriously a problem for me about the payment option.. about a week ago I recharged of Rs1650.. but I don't get coins after the payment..and today again I recharged of Rs 240 again it's going same.. I need those coins back other wise return the money..I will see how you take the action.. please do this favor.. thank you"

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say S correctly in the word \"snake\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months.

            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. 👍",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

My assistant and situations I used and had and enjoyed didn't seem so personal anymore:( maybe apple and iphones can use safari voice or cortana and intel cores or manufacturers. Separated...",

Actual people put actual work into making this game. They should be compensated. So why not give them the $10? Or delete the demo if you don't like the game enough to pay for it.",
            "I know people worked hard on this game but I have some complaints about Coco itself. 1. How do I enjoy the game with so many ads seriously every 15sec there is a ad . Witch makes the whole process difficult. 2. This is crazy I like to play but everything costs money that some people won't do or can't afford. 3. Learn to let the ages not affect the game it asks my age and I say my age it works but some reviews say there age doesn't work so please fix this. Please fix this we would all like it.",
            "Well on this game, you basically nave to pay FOR EVERYTHING. And when i say everything i mean the GOOD stuff. I mean you get the bad/medium stuff for free, but when it comes to the good stuff, you basically have to get your credit card ready. Also, the game gets a bit boring after a while. You just repeat all of the stuff and then just carry on all over again. The good stuff is that if you loose you still get fans, there are options to choose from of what you want to do and I guess thats it.",
            "It's a really good game but... You can't have that much access to a lot of things because they're locked and it not fair cuz well you have to pay to unlock alot of things while if you don't wanna pay you don't have much access to anything but it not fair cuz we should at least get access to the clinic like right? All I want is for you to make more things available for people who don't wanna pay and to also take away the ads cuz there's alot them btw I still love this game thank you! 😉",
            "3 reasons I have this game a 4 instead a 5. 1 there is A LOT OF ADDS, and when I mean A LOT... well that just mean a lot! 2 there is a lot of buying, you need to fix that! Will it make more sense if u earn the \"money and then buy what ever u need to buy in the game? 3 please let the other contestants be other people instead of bots, please! So I really love this game, but I think u should make some changes! Love E!"

            "After reading a few of the reviews, I was nervous about trying to update. Happy to say I had absolutely NO problem. I used to have problems with many updates until I realized that my VPN was working too well, lol. (Even with \"safe\" sites. Nord can suck and I'm sorry I paid for 3 years in advance to get a good deal, or I'd have dumped it ages ago!) I never know what update is going to be stopped until it is, so if you're having trouble and have a VPN, try pausing it then try again.",
            "I'm always a little hesitant about updating this update after reading the reviews each time. It seems this update always seems to be tied to an update with Chrome. I have not had any issues with updating to this latest version. It is concerning, when there seems to be no feedback from the development team, who put out these updates. I hope someone is making them aware, of all the difficulties people are running into. Someone on their end should always monitor, after an update is available.",
            "It's awful and won't update, and because of, google chrome won't update!!! Fix it!!!!... C'mon!!! Stop giving us updates that don't work!! And because of it, google chrome will also not update!!! Said before, FIX IT!! or stop doing updates!! And yes, I've tried possible fixes that others have stated, still no! Herd we are again, one week later and this app won't update thus chrome won't update!! Fix ur crappy software or better stop the updates since they don't work anyway!",
            "nearly every weboage opened using this. When scrolling down, freezes and \"shakes\" on Android 11/ pixel 3xl Would love to delete it. But I've got years of saved content in it. Which for some reason known only to the Google gods. Does not save in the full version of chrome. Why? If I save a site in webview, aka bookmark it. Why doesn't it save in chrome too. Doing so would eliminate more of the infamous Google duplicity. We could eliminate this app or chrome. Which are technically the same",
            "I can't even download the most recent update, despite trying for several days. Reading the other recent reviews, I see that maybe it's good I've got an old version. Not good, cause it's still been buggy as hell, but, better (maybe)? What's going on? I use Android so this is affecting my other apps badly."

It immaculately cleans all the cache , and has an option to select which files to delete, which if not present would create a lot of problem. It also checks before deleting.Clears trash very fast. Love this app 😻",
            "Ever since I did the updated to Android 10 things have gotten worse. Camera does not accept micro usb, cameral will not save pictures and had deleted pictures on SD card without warning, apps have been slow or icons show they are there and they deleted by the update etc..Not happy at all.",

This app is total waste of time. Dont download it. You will regret it. The functions are haphazard and the speech of the SimSimi is mostly out of the context. I had only began to chat and it called me darling and chatted in foreign language",

If you don't spend on the app. They won't even let you name your character, you have to pay for it. Lol. Don't install this. Tried the \"helping simsimi\" feature that says it rewards you talk more freely with limited time. It still sucks!!",

It&#39;s the same Fruit Ninja you know and love, but with gorgeous new visuals and tech! Slice fruit like never before in glorious high definition!<br><br>With this remake, we also have big plans for future updates that just weren&#39;t possible before. Stay tuned!",
        "comments": [
            "What the HELL is this new update? I thought this game was one of the few that weren't THAT outright money hungry, but now you removed the powers from all the blades and dojos I got from YEARS of hard work playing this game, just to introduce gems and loot boxes? The looks improved amazingly, they were truly outdated, but for the 10th anniversary instead of new exciting features you implement LOOT BOXES, HALFBRICK? You guys need help. Uninstalling and boycotting this everywhere I can.",
            "This used to be the height of childhood gameplay. The graphics USED to be fabulous, the menus USED to be well set up and intuitive, the missions USED to be fun. In other words, Fruit Ninja has been sllwly sinking lower and lower, and the recent 10th Anniversary Update has made it hit rock bottom.",
            "Gameplay wise the game is very fun. However one thing I've noticed in the new update is that you need to open loot boxes to get certain blades when all the blades used to use the level system. There shouldn't be a paywall for blades you once could unlock by playing normally in a previous update. Also this app stutters quite a lot and my phone usually handles games decently. For reference I'm using a samsung a20 for my device.",
            "Fruit ninja has always been one of my favourite games since the past so many years. Even my kids enjoy playing it. Two days back it got updated automatically. Shows upcoming additions. My only glitch is the new music when fruits arw cut. Can we have the old one back. This is not 'music to ears' as was the earlier one. Its disturbing and irritating, not in the flow of the game. Sync is also way off. Not in sync with when fruits are cut.",
            "Not impressed with the 10th anniversary update. The blades and dojos all seem to be the same. Some missions aren't registering your points and you can't change the missions as in the past. I'll give it a few more days to see if anything changes. But if not, I'll be deleting"

            "Update: Editing the song info is really slow. I've been disappointed with the recent updates. A lot of features are gone. I've been a premium user for a few years now but I don't think I'll continue. I can easily search the lyrics with the original language+english in the info, now you need to only put the original language. Also, instead of a year worth of premium, now the premium ends in Dec 31 in the year. What kind of nonsense is that?",
            "I've gone through a few different reviews here. This serviceos great and despite previous hardships I can now use the app like expexted, I no longer have to clear all data to use the premium services. Now everything's working like it should and I'm happy again. This review will always be updated to reflect my experiences. For now this is probably the best out there for fans of karaoke and singalong activities. Check it out, chances are you won't be disappointed and the premium price is a steal.",
            "Musixmatch is a great app but unfortunately, riddled with bugs. Sometimes songs don't play, saying \"Selected playlist is empty\", sometimes another song plays instead of the one I tapped on, sometimes changes in playlists are not taken into account... It used to be my favourite but I'm looking for another music player now... It's too annoying to deal with this app.",
            "Best app for hearing the song along with lyrics and you can also get the song lyrics in offline. This is the best thing I've found in this app. If you think that something is wrong in song lyrics, you can do it's correction . For correcting by syncing , editing song lyrics or translating the song in all other languages you will get contribution points. So guys, join musixmatch today and start contributing.",
            "When i update this app, the editing song goes really slow. I dont know the problem, its not my internet, its the app. Its really much better on the previous version... Please fix the app, i thought updating this app makes it more efficient, but it's not happening now. Buying the premium is not worth after all 🤨😑"

It's open source which is good, and uses an encrypted database that can be easily saved to any cloud-based storage of your choosing, so you are always in control of it. After searching for ages for an app like this I've finally found it! I'm so impressed that I've bought the developer a beer!",

I first started using it on Linux but it's open source, so you can generally find an app to work with your KeePass database files on just about any platform. It also works with Dropbox. This particular app has had a few bumps but those seem to have been smoothed out. Special thanks to the Dev for all the hard work and dedication. 🙂",

        "description": "Speech Therapy: Z\r\nIs your child working on saying Z correctly? If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: Z is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say Z and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice Z with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say Z correctly in the word \"zigzag\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices Z by saying \"zip\" every time a child zips a coat, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say Z\r\n~Guide on how to teach Z to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online Z flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app. You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach Z to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying Z\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on Z for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying Z\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

I hope you will take a quick decision to improve all of these problems which players are facing.",

And all of good characters are only of diamonds. I am of middle class family i do not have such money. Please solve it. Anyway its such a lovely game.I like it very much. THANK YOU.",
            "I rated it 5 star, because when I installed this this game is really nice because it's graphics. But nowadays there is many issues arised,one of them is the connection problem,I have really good internet connection but here always ping above 200,when I watching others game play when my character is dead,there is ping 78-90, but when I target a enemies at that point of time ping is converted into 250-350, .I saw damage on my screen and after few seconds, showing me that I'm dead..lol games.",
            "Overall it's one of the best game tru there. Superd gameplay and graphical. Also easy to play too. It's very addictive and engaging . But the only problem is It's a pay to win the game with the power ful guns they get from it . I for fact don't like it and it's disappointing. I would suggest to include more skins and other Stuffs in the Elite pass rather then making guns more power.",
            "The game overall is good but pls fix the problem of the sensitivity of the player and especially the scope (of all kind). And pls fix the graphics section. The graphics are not nice, so pls get it like call of duty. So it may look better and then playing this game will become more interesting. And just add more variety of guns and skins. Just these 3 problems forced me to to cut out 2 stars from my review."

Despite this lack of interest and an app that doesn't work, Familonet continued to charge my card. Payment increased, without notice, from one annual charge on my card, to the increased amount... outrageously charged quarterly. I have no satisfaction and no refund. They have no integrity and a terrible app. A total waste of time & money!",

I have done this, multiple times, checked every app in my phone to make sure I don't have the battery saver ones as per instructions in the app. The app has permission to run as it needs to but the message is still on my profile. Tried to contact you through your page and there was nothing on the contact support page. I've spent over an hour trying to fix this but am going with another app.",

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

            "Awesome app. Challenging if you want it to be or relaxing if you choose the easy mode. Very user friendly too.",
            "I like that it tells you if you have the wrong letter and if you get stuck you can ask for a letter. The questions are general knowledge. Another app had their puzzles according to different subjects so if you didn't know anything about that particular subject you were lost. The easy ones are hard enough for me but I like that you have a choice for people that might be more skilled in crosswords. (Smarter than I am!)",
            "Update: Some of the Clues & Answers seem to be aimed at the \"boomer\" generation and the C&A's are repeated often. It's still a great crossword game, It's a simple design, user friendly, it costs nothing to use hints. Which is great for anyone who wants to unwind. Not everyone knows who the star of \"touched by an angel\" is. And that's ok! You don't need to know. Use the hints that don't require you to watch ads, spend coins, wait (X amount) time or cost you money. Be free & relax 😊",
            "Used to be great, but now ads are too intrusive. Before, a simple silent ad would pop up and you could tap through it. Fairly low annoyance factor. Now, massive full-screen ads with obnoxiously loud audio FORCE you to watch videos for games you don't want. The frequency of the ads has increased too. The game is great otherwise, with a solid easy interface and good features. Used to be a lot of fun but I am sadly going to have to uninstall."

You will learn how to systematically practice SH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home.

I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say SH correctly in the word \"chef\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices SH by saying \"shut\" every time he/she closes a door, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say SH\r\n~Tips on how to teach SH to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online SH flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning and reading at first. Then, you just have to carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child.

However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!!
