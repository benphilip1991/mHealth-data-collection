Puzzles, videos, music, interaction, and more. My son cannot completely operate it by himself, but because he already knows his ABCs and number 1-10, I am expecting him to have a better grasp of the environment within the next couple months. I am also expecting for him to be reading in about 6 months from this app.",
            "Kids love it! But there are so many bugs. It freezes, and some of the activities do not work property. If things do not get smoothed out, I will have to cancel my subscription. I cant keep paying for something that frustrates my kids during learning instead of making learning fun. Other than the glitches and bugs, the kids enjoy the app and they do learn something new every day they open the app.",
            "I payed the subscription for a year. What I wanted from the application was to teach and advanced my children in their reading and math. It is a great application that entertains my children while they learn social sciences and a little bit of both: math and reading. But I'm not 100% sure if they are really advancing as I wanted. My children have 7 and 8 years old.",
            "Complete waste of money couldnt even get to play with all the upsell content and did 20 recaptcha verifications to no avail. There are so many better apps free that dont want all you family history and life information... if the app was that good they wouldnt need to lock you in to a lifetime subscription before you even tried it! IF my son loved it i would happily pay for it but i dont trust them when you cant even try without signing your life away",
            "Don't download. NOT FREE!!! I spent 30 minutes downloading this and another 15 min installing only to come up to a main page where you go to put in credit card information and stuff but you can get one month free and then they will auto charge you $9.95 a month until you cancel. You you don't even get an option of having a dumbed down version of this app to see if we would even like it. I don't want to pay for something I have no idea if I'm going to like or my kids going to use!!"

            "I absolutely love this app. It is beyond any other \"so called\" educational app. This is so intuitive and really engages my kids. I have a child with exceptionalities as well and she is able to navigate, understand and learn the concepts. I love how the content is tailored to the age of the child. My son is able to learn more advance subjects by changing the age. The best part is that there are ABSOLUTELY NO ADS and it is free!!! I highly recommend this to all parents.",
            "I am absolutely in LOVE with this app! It has the best learning material and no ads. Perfect!! I was looking for something educational for my 7 and 4 year old, and this is the only one I will ever use for them. It's perfect. Seriously deleting all other learning apps and games because this is the only one they will ever need. I can't believe it's completely free and no ads. Thank you so much for making this amazing app free for my children and helping them learn. I am so greatful!!!",
            "My little niece loves it! Everything is VERY clear, easy to understand, fun and really helps keep their attn while learning! NO ADS and NEVER boring!! Can't believe this is a FREE APP!!! KAK doesn't give kids the answers, they have to actually figure things out (and learn), which is wonderful! The fun (sometimes silly) songs and educational stories are great!! There's constant positive reinforcement, throughout. If they get an answer wrong, they're encouraged to keep trying. EXCELLENT APP üëå!!",
            "We love this app! It's one of my son's favorite things to do on his new tablet. He calls it his \"learning\". I do wish you could track progress through the regular Khan Academy (as he has an account there), and there's definitely a need for more to do offline. We like to use this in the car or while we are out for very long periods of time, but he is getting bored with the small bits he can do offline. Otherwise, this is a really great app, overall.",
            "Picky 4 and 6 year old enjoyed the challenges. Most of the time, I have to remind them to try the apps but not this one‚Äîthey voluntarily uses it. The user interface of the app of a thumbs up too. It's easier for parents to find a subject and see which topics from their list hasn't been opened yet because it shows a check sign once you're done with a certain topic."

            "Very good game! Thus, for language it is important 1. To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered. I have to change a level back manually at each session, because I am sure that my child does not remember a name of an object, but got the program algoryth using visual clues.",

This game felt like it was slapped together with bright pictures just to get the ad revenue. Hire a couple of preschool teachers to show you what you did wrong, or test your product with some kids.",

OR TURN THE NET OFF ON YOUR PHONE BOOM NO ADDS",
            "Too many adds to be in a kids game gets ridiculous with my kid always opening other stuff cause of the adds and having to fix it back to game and I paid for the advancement if not remove adds on normal need to remove adds if you have someone pay the advancement but shouldn't even have adds in a kids learning game in the first place that's just poor quality game system."

            "My two year old loves this. I'm pretty passionate about education and went to school for it. I sit with him for guidance but he can pretty much operate and learn on his own with this. It's not the only early learning academy we've tried, but it's my favorite. I have yet to see everything the app has to offer. I'll update when we finish. Can the developers fix the way the computer pronounces the letter \"o\" and distinguish between the appearance of uppercase \"i\" and lowercase \"L\"?",
            "Used it a while, it's brilliant, and I'm hard to impress. The breadth, the engaging design, the simple but pleasant animation, the music. It's all just right for 3-6 year olds. Asked me to rate immediately after install, that was dumb.",
            "I would give 0 stars if that was an option! I set up for 7 day trial, and authorized 1-yr payment, but can't use it! It keeps telling me that I have to authenticate the account but I can't do that either! What gives? I would not recommend this app to anyone!",

When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",
            "It's great app for special child..but it's much costy to compare to other apps.if a possible prodive some more discount for monthly payment.....",
            "This program is absolutely amazing. I swear they have to be hypnotizing or drugging my little guy the way he calms down excitedly when its otsimo time..ü§î Im gonna need to get a lifetime license",
            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

        "description": "Teach spelling with phonics to children.\r\n\r\nSoon after the alphabets with phonics learning, the stage of ‚ÄúSpelling with Phonics‚Äù comes for early graders. It starts with two letter words (At, Ot, En), followed by Spelling Three letter CVC words (consonant, vowel, consonant) Bat, Cat, Rat, Pen etc.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, this process involves collecting and filtering the suitable words and print these words to create flashcards. These flashcards are then presented as a joining cards demonstration to a group of students in the classroom.\r\n\r\nSince these cards are supposed to be presented repetitively for reinforcement, the difficult handling of printed cards makes it a tiresome and a classroom specific activity.\r\n\r\nIn this ‚ÄúLearn Three 3 Letter Words Spelling‚Äù App, we have searched and filtered maximum suitable words and compiled them into ONE interactive learning app.\r\n\r\nThe app is primarily made for teaching assistance and can be effectively used in the classroom. It is equally good for parents to reinforce the concept in their homes.\r\n\r\nIt not only saves printing, makes all the repetitive tasks automated, but also provides progress monitoring which makes it more effective than printed sheets.\r\n\r\nThe app is very simple to use. It starts with one of 14 provided categories (Collection of AT, OT, ED Words etc) with a basic animation about how A & T combines to form ‚ÄúAT‚Äù. Below you can find the possible letter combinations for drag and match to form the CVC word.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the word is formed and spoken, a corresponding image is shown for better understanding and teaching assistance.\r\n\r\nThe progress of learning individual word can be easily seen as a star is given for every word completion. A maximum of 5 stars are given and then the word is greyed out making it temporarily disabled. This functionality is provided for forcibly excelling to more words. The stars however can be reset to re-enable the greyed out words.\r\n\r\nThe continuous practice of all the words in every category makes the parent / teacher confident about introducing maximum words formation.\r\n\r\nClean & animated interface, beautiful relative images, studio quality voiceover and a handful selection of words makes it perfect for an ideal learning app.\r\n\r\nSalient Features\r\n\r\n14 Categories 84 Essential Words\r\nTeacher Proofread Content\r\nHigh Quality Images\r\nStudio Quality Voiceover\r\nStars for progress tracking\r\nInteractive & Animated\r\nClean & Attractive Interface\r\nIt is a must have educational app which is provided Free to download as a demo. There are a total of 14 categories with all essential words to practice for kids. It is strongly recommended to practice the ads-free and complete app to ensure a better understanding for words formation.\r\n\r\nApart from teaching basic spelling making technique, This app also improves vocabulary and promotes phonetic learning. The app is ideal to be practiced in the classroom and is equally beneficial to be practiced in the home.\r\n\r\nThe app consumes a very small amount of disk space, thus can be kept in the device for as long as required.\r\n\r\nYou can buy the complete app within the app itself.\r\n\r\nWe at ‚ÄúHoliday Educationist‚Äù have a team of trained & certified teachers to proofread the apps‚Äô content for the optimum quality assurance.",

A maximum of 5 stars are given and then the word is greyed out making it temporarily disabled. This functionality is provided for forcibly excelling to more words. The stars however can be reset to re-enable the greyed out words.<br><br>The continuous practice of all the words in every category makes the parent / teacher confident about introducing maximum words formation.<br><br>Clean &amp; animated interface, beautiful relative images, studio quality voiceover and a handful selection of words makes it perfect for an ideal learning app.<br><br>Salient Features<br><br>14 Categories 84 Essential Words<br>Teacher Proofread Content<br>High Quality Images<br>Studio Quality Voiceover<br>Stars for progress tracking<br>Interactive &amp; Animated<br>Clean &amp; Attractive Interface<br>It is a must have educational app which is provided Free to download as a demo.

            "I like the teaching technique of the app. It is really good. However, the pronunciation is not accurate such as /t/ sound. I would have used this app to teach my kids if you had changed the pronunciation into a correct one. Anyway, thank you for producing a good app. Hopefully, the flaw will be editted, and I will definitely download the app again.",
            "Amazing app. It really helped my kid who was struggling with blending. In a matter of few mins she was able to understand the blending which we were trying to teach her without this visual representation. Wish we could have found this app much earlier and saved lot of time and effort. Thanks a lot for this app and I strongly recommend this!! Suggestion: Why don't you add diagraph sounds as well to the same app? Then will be a completed app.",

            "A good 4/5 because it's ads on every one after you get some and bc that without wifi you only can do the cat",
            "My kids love this app! I‚Äôve had this app for about four-month now. My boys absolutely love the well-drawn cartoons. I see people saying this app is pricey or it should be free, still I think it‚Äôs a reasonable price for a children‚Äôs app (compared to the store prices). The only point is ‚Äì I wish we could add more children to the growth plan. I have two boys playing, yet only one gets his own growth-plan. Overall fantastic app! Teaches them animals, letters, numbers, colors, which is always a plus",
            "They charge subscription then there is another ad, forcing weekly or annual subscription, cannot access the growth plan. To the developer responding, I did not ask for it to be free, I paid a subscription and got very little access in return for my money.The app is great, but the fact remains I paid for access not limited access.",
            "My 2 and a half year old really enjoys even if some are above his level. Good job. Lots of fun",
            "I really like this kids app, because it includes educational games for different kids age: learning games for toddlers, preschoolers, kindergarteners, has colorful elements and animals game. The most important is that my nephews enjoy playing this kids game."

            "Good game, Some people are saying that this game has many adds but my sis play this game in her phone I also think to download and downloading,i saw in reviews some people are saying this game has many adds but not! I asked to my sis(Who play this game)she said\"No\"So I am also going to download it because of the color activity because I can draw beautiful,And I really like this game I recommend this game to all speacially kids because this game is for kids but other like adults, young,old",
            "Intrusive ads in a kids drawing app. Ridiculous.",
            "My daughter kept hitting their stupid advertising plug and was constantly being kicked from the game. The multi touch for the dragging the shapes around is garbage also. She knew where the shapes needed to go but it kept giving her the error noise",
            "I am a 33 year old male and I have never seen colour before since I am colour blind. I have recently undergone eye surgery and I can finally see colour. I decided to download this app so I know which colour is which and oh my goodness if this isn't the BEST app I've ever downloaded i don't know what is. I recommend this to everyone of all ages. P.s. you are never too old to learn!"

            "The app is great, really well developed games for kids to learn Spanish. My daughter loved every game . Certainly a good app if you are intending to teach a young one Spanish. The only downside is the hefty monthly price tag. You can simultaneously subscribe to three major TV streaming apps for the same monthly price of this app. I would continue using it if it was better valued. I have unfortunately unsubscribed.",
            "Whole Lotta fun, but why so short? My daughter is loved it, but my oldest in third grade blew through all 12 lessons in less than three weeks. We are glad you gave us a month free, but being that you hope to retain monthly subscriptions, it seems like there is no point in continuing to renew because we've already done the 12 short lessons.",
            "My 7 heard old daughter lives this program. It's fun and easy for her to use alone. I love hearing her say the words aloud and how easily she is picking up the Spanish vocabulary.",
            "It's easy for my kids to use (age 7 and 3) and they seem to retain more vocab with the game format than other apps I've tried",
            "This is a great game for my son whose bilingual preschool education is interrupted by the quarantine. We've played all the \"Color\" and \"Animal\" games so far - this is a VERY well designed game for young children. However, I wish you would take out the part in one of the games where an \"audience\" boos at the child if they get an answer wrong. My son was instantly jarred w/surprise to hear \"booing\" at him, and immediately became self-conscious & upset and didn't want to finish playing that part."

Sharing a pdf via email didn't work (no PDF attached to email!).  Worse yet, Google Play denied a refund of the $3.49 purchase price, despite my  requesting the refund within less than an hour of purchase. I uninstalled the app, re-downloaded, and now all I have access to is the free version; I can't even use the limited functionality I paid for in the first place!  I've written to the developer to request a direct refund, and will update this review with their response."

Likewise, if your¬†child¬†is ready to move on, you need not waste time on repetitive lessons and move through the educational materials at a pace that suits their need. Areas in which a child excels can be maximized and accelerated. Areas in which a child struggles can be focused on until the child really conquers that subject. True learning becomes the primary focus of education.\r\n\r\nWe at Tabkids recognize that there should be more to a child's education rather than just intellectual development.

        "descriptionHTML": "Tabkids brings to you the best early learning app  for Nursery - Grade 2 with over 2500 Teacher videos which include the entire course as well as videos on music, dance, yoga, sports, motor skill enhancement, morals,  art and craft  etc. along with printable worksheets, online worksheets and much much more. <br><br>Every topic is covered Lesson by Lesson in a systematic school like manner.<br><br>While e-learning has been eagerly taken up by parents for  middle, secondary and senior levels, many were on the look out for an alternate mode of learning for  pre-primary and early primary learners hence we at Tabkids decided to bring you this all in one E-learning portal with exclusive features which enables our young learners to learn at their own pace .<br><br>A rich repository of fun-filled, entertaining, engaging age-appropriate child centric learning and pedagogy . <br><br>Tabkids allows¬†personal attention¬†in the form of variety of practice sheets on a single topic for the learners to completely understand and master the topic at their own pace before moving on to the next level . <br><br>Google assessment forms is a diagnostic and effective feature we provide which lets them retrace their steps and rethink the problem to attempt it again and eventually ace it with no peer pressure or time constraint. <br><br>The personal progress bar feature inbuilt into the software is another exclusive feature of the app which analyses how much the child has learnt.<br><br>Tabkids early learning app allows you to take all the time you need to ensure learning is taking place along with fun. Likewise, if your¬†child¬†is ready to move on, you need not waste time on repetitive lessons and move through the educational materials at a pace that suits their need.

True learning becomes the primary focus of education.<br><br>We at Tabkids recognize that there should be more to a child&#39;s education rather than just intellectual development. Hence we lay emphasis on  value education too .  We emphatically claim that the relationship between a teacher and a learner is that of great importance to bring about positive outcomes.

            "This is the perfect app for finding a daycare provider. I recently moved to the Palmdale area and was worried about finding a good place for my kids while I'm at work. Palmdale is still an unfamiliar place to me but thanks to WeeCare my kids and I feel much more at home and part of the community in this area. WeeCare helped me with the transition immensely! Their app is very easy to use. I love the picture and video updates of my kids I receive every day. Thank you WeeCare!",
            "This app needs a lot of work. The services that are available through the app are great...when it's working. My daycare provider sends \"moments\" for me to view regularly, but there are days (like today) when the app crashes for several hours at a time. I've been trying to launch it for 7 hours already.",

            "The app is decent at covering the main functionality. But it has a few annoying limitations. 1. The photos added by the teachers are not automatically downloaded, so we have to click download many times often. 2. The conversation functionality is limited, e.g. today we wanted to send a photo of a missing toy, no way to do that. 3. Hard to find out remotely if q kid has been checked in - have to scroll through the notifications. Why can't i just see it on the home page? So. Good, but not great.",
            "This app is incredible, from a parent's perspective. I couldn't be more grateful that our new school/ daycare uses it, and if they charge a higher tuition rate because of it, that is just fine. It is worth every penny. It brings peace of mind, invaluable communication, and a priceless peak into our precious child's day.",
            "Really great and easy experience. It makes me feel like I'm in the know about what/how my kid is doing, even when we're apart. Everything works well - from photos, check in/out, potty training updates, snacks, payments. Just a stellar way to handle childcare, and I really appreciate it.",

            "Pay to play. Only lets you play with 2 dinosaurs before charging $3 to continue. If you have tons of money, go for it, because otherwise it is great for amusing kids. I like the game, but you deserve a one star rating for the deception. You know what you did.",
            "My son loves it. You get 2 dinosaurs for free, allowing you to trial whether your child likes it, and the remaining 6 for ¬£2.99. My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."

The new message button is on the message screen in the same spot as \"Send\" in all my other messaging apps. Since there is no \"are you sure you want to leave this screen? You haven't sent your message\" step, I frequently lose messages I have already written by bumping \"new message.\" A \"New message\" button does not need to be on the writing screen.",
            "I love the app. Has everything we need as a parent in one place. Invoices, pictures, updates. I love seeing how my kids are doing throughout the day, how much they eat and how long they sleep. Gives me a great idea when they get home each day what I should be expecting for their moods and how they're day went since they cannot tell us yet themselves.",
            "I do not like this app. It is very clunky, stiffand not intuitive. For example you cant click on pictures to see them enlarged if the picture is in a message. And it does not give you an option to create a distinctive sound for an alert. This app has contributed to lack of communication instead of ease of communication",
            "Great way to keep the parents updated and there child's day. It is also a great way to help teachers keep track of what has been done and what needs to be done for their students. The app is easy to navigate and it's fun to put those notes and pictures in for the parents.",
            "Love the app, HATE the name! In today's times so many children don't have \"mama\"s. There are so many family types and structures in the world of childcare that it seems silly to name it something that truly doesn't apply to so many people in our world. It could be HiFamily, HiCaregiver, or something else entirely. A different name could make the app much more relevant for 2020."

            "This is a great way to engage students. One thing I would like to see change is the color code, 7 seconds is not long enough for most students to input the code. I also have trouble getting games started because students loose thier connection to the game after joining.",
            "This is a great app the only complaint is you can't make your own pin and play with other friends cuz when you type student it won't let me lion and when I try to enter the pin like I make a pin and it just won't let me play it because they did some research the PIN well the rest of the game is fun but I am I always need to get another device so so I can play in the rest of the game is pretty fun that's why I'm giving you five stars your games are pretty good keep up the good work I play this .",

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "I tested the game for my grandson and I think it may be a bit scary for him. Also the the advertisement on this game you have to use the back arrow key on my phone. He already uses the phone like a pro, but you need to place skip button or something for the 2 year old. The advertisement or getting back to the game will make the little ones discouraged. Educational app ..but change the character (s).",
            "games ok but not happy about it trying to con children into down loading apps on to your device. I dont mind having adverts but object to having apps pop up with the big \"install app\" button prominently placed for a two year olds fat fudgey fingers to press and install with no idea what it is. deleted your game now. after response from developer. I will do that, thank you for informing me about that. As I said, the game is fine so might be worth paying and getting rid of the adverts completely",
            "It's good for little ones that have been started on math and other things. It's super cute and my little sister loves dinosaurs so it's perfect except that you have to read play the same thing over and over until you have enough stars.",
            "Seems like an ok game so far. My son seems to be interested and he is 2. But I think if there are going to be ads, the 'X' needs to bigger so he can learn to press it until I think this game is worth buying."

And she doesn't know how to click them off, so I'm constantly having to help turn them off when I'm busy doing other things! Rather annoying if you ask me! Also, she keeps accidently clicking on the purchase button too as the adverts keep popping up. It can easily run up your card!",

            "This is a bad and good game at the same time the bad thing about this game is they offer you money to buy stuff and my mom can't handle it so the good thing is is that it's educational and and this is just a terrible game and a good game",
            "I see people complaining about the price, but this app feels not much like a game, and more like a streaming video service for kids, except that the content is hand-picked (exceptionally well), and also includes some games/books/activities. Videos can also be downloaded for offline viewing. My 4-year-old loves it. I just wish download mode had a configurable cap on storage use (least recently viewed auto-deleted to make room), or that in streaming mode parents could hand-pick what to download.",
            "Terrible. An ad for this popped up on another game and automatically signed me up for this service, no confirmation that you will be charged or anything. There is no easy way to cancel and get a refund, instead you have to contact their support and HOPE that someone gets back to you soon. I would never willingly purchase this service",
            "Horrible! My daughter was playing another game and an clicked on the add for this and automatically charged my sprint account and subscribed us for a monthly fee of 9.99.

            "It is a very good app. I liked it so much . But I think that some other subjects must be included in this app, like social science, English (because in English there are some words or sentences that you understand is not that word or sentences which you are thinking about that, they have other meaning. So this is also the problem in English). I hope that you will understand and help students to know more easily in those subjects and making interest on boring subjects like history, etc. Thanksüòä"

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

The movement of the objects on the screen were rather jerky, which kinda gave me a headache after just a minute of play. To be honest, I feel like usually Thup puts quite a bit of effort into the quality of the art used for their games, but this one felt very subpar on pretty much all of the artwork. I felt like it was the quality you would see for a $0.99 game or possibly even a free game.",

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",

The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

There also needs to be more options to save your work.

            "I used to enjoy the app, and was getting pretty good with my skill level, then out of nowhere the app started acting glitchy and periodically freezing up right in the middle of a song, and the notes became unresponsive to the touch, and would score you as though your timing was off and you missed them as they came in line with the keys and the intended time to strike or tap them. It's extremely frustrating to be scored so low when it's not a low skill set, but a buggy app causing it. Please fix",

            "I love this app. I use it to edit all my Youtube videos (See Spot Clean is the name of my channel). The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there's a song on there that I really like using but every time I do, and I put the credit down exactly as they have it, I get a copywrite strike on the video I'm trying to upload and I have to go back into InShot and cut that song and replace it. It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",
            "Hi! I really enjoy this app so much i always use it! But it's missing a few features that i would recommend would make the app better! Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",
            "After practicing with new features, I found it very helpful and easy for video editing on smart phone device. The app provided good instructions and the developers actively update the app. Thanks. I decided to buy app since you guys deserve it for the quality given."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

            "My grandson loves this app. He was five when he started playing and now he is in grade one and is still finding it stimulating. I tried some others but they were too advanced for him. The repetitive nature of it is stimulating and rewarding because he feels like he is doing work. But he knows what to do and it isn't overwhelming. I thought that he would find it too simple because his favorite game is Minecraft, which is very challenging. But the music and graphics really strikes a chord.",

Kids, parents and teachers can use it to create your own story with pictures, video, sounds and text-to-speech. From kindergarten circle to special education, anyone can benefit from this new way of expressing memories and ideas.\r\n\r\nEach story is organized in pages with a picture, video and text. The pages can have a sound clip attached or text-to-speech interpretation. The  pictures and sounds can  be selected from device albums or recorded instantly. A draw and handwriting pad is available for Samsung Galaxy / Note S Pen. The stories can be added and edited with an easy to use  wizard. Fun effects can be added with the integrated Aviary photo editor. The stories can be saved as PDF and e-mailed. The entire story can also be shared by email with other Show And Tell users.\r\n\r\nThe application is particularly useful for teachers, therapists and parents. It allows for quick creation of personalized sequenced stories,  with the possibility of introducing own phots, video, text and audio recording. The application is best suited for young children or children with reduced speech clarity, learning disabilities, autism, behavior difficulties, developmental disabilities and/or emerging  language abilities (nonverbal communication, speech therapy).\r\n \r\nShow and Tell provides the adults working with the children a tool to stimulate language, including comprehension, oral  expressive skills, reading and writing skills. The app can be used to create social narratives to depict common social problems or conflicts  and ways to address them in a socially acceptable way. The app allows for maximum flexibility on the part of the adult designing the story  for the child. For example, if the teacher chose to draw small figurines on paper to depict emotions and actions, then a picture can be taken and ‚Äúvoila‚Äù, a story was created which can then be used over and over again, until the target behavior is learned. \r\n\r\nThe app allows the user to create sequenced stories which are often key for early language and literacy development. The stories created can  be used to expand conversations, introducing the story elements to the child or introducing more details and richness to the  conversational exchange. \r\n\r\nThe stories can be used to support children with severe articulation disorders, oral language difficulties, nonverbal or autistic children.  The parents or teacher may create simple stories to depict an activity that the child has done, then use the app to allow the child to share  the information with others, familiar or unfamiliar peers and adults, in order to expand the range of people that the child communicates with. \r\n\r\nIf the focus is on Vocabulary and concept development, the teacher or parent may take pictures of multiple objects depicting a concept that is a focus for the child  (such as colors, numbers, sizes, etc), then create a quick story for the child to refer to. \r\n\r\nThe app may be used to create early literacy individualized alphabet books to aid children who are struggling to make the connection between  the letters and their respective sounds through association with pictures of personally meaningful things. For example, the book of B may  include several pictures of favorite items of the child that start with B, such as ball, bananas, beaver tails. A familiar voice recording would increase familiarity  and ensure faster connections are made.  \r\n\r\nChildren with working memory difficulties may benefit from the stories created with Show and Tell to replay a sequence of familiar events for quick reference. For example, a child may use a story which replays the steps required to do a pen and paper exercise in class or homework. \r\n \r\nThis is a demo version.

The parents or teacher may create simple stories to depict an activity that the child has done, then use the app to allow the child to share  the information with others, familiar or unfamiliar peers and adults, in order to expand the range of people that the child communicates with. <br><br>If the focus is on Vocabulary and concept development, the teacher or parent may take pictures of multiple objects depicting a concept that is a focus for the child  (such as colors, numbers, sizes, etc), then create a quick story for the child to refer to. <br><br>The app may be used to create early literacy individualized alphabet books to aid children who are struggling to make the connection between  the letters and their respective sounds through association with pictures of personally meaningful things. For example, the book of B may  include several pictures of favorite items of the child that start with B, such as ball, bananas, beaver tails. A familiar voice recording would increase familiarity  and ensure faster connections are made.  <br><br>Children with working memory difficulties may benefit from the stories created with Show and Tell to replay a sequence of familiar events for quick reference. For example, a child may use a story which replays the steps required to do a pen and paper exercise in class or homework. <br> <br>This is a demo version. The full version is available on Google Play, search for &quot;wsisat&quot;.",

It starts from preschool level upwards and my children can navigate their way around the app with ease. It's an app that keeps them engaged and it's full of fun graphics and music. They have had great fun learning maths recently.",

My sons does NOT like math at all but I am teaching them how to tell time as well as what is greater than and less than. They can be ahead in class this coming school year because of the levels that are on this app. The only thing that I did have problems with is the glitches which I understand will be worked out. Overall, this app is very helpful for my sons in Math",

The character my niece made for another zapzap math app was already pre-selected when we downloaded this one! Pretty awesome! The games seem alot more engaging than the previous app. My niece stays playing it for a good amount of time with this one! I can see an improvement in her math skills already and I havent had this for an entire week yet!"

I don't know why it happens. And also when I attending a class, if suddenly I left the class, I can't join this again. Please fix these problems.",
            "I really loved the app and its concept. All the teachers are amazing and the best part is the quiz . I really enjoy all sessions learning and competing with others. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because whenever I join a session using app, after a while it throws me out of the class which is very disappointing then I have to join it using the link on browser. üôèüôèüôè Please try to solve it because I am really finding it difficult to join each class again and again ....",
            "It is a very conceptual framework of a educational platform.Loved the classes as well as all the teachers..I would recommend this app..The thing I m giving only three stars here is because it sometimes depict the recorded sessions in the form of live classes and the teachers too don't solve doubts in the class.. sometimes luckily u can get their response But yet only sometimes that too by luck.",
            "Good app. Just one problem. The VQuiz is supposed to be for chlidren between the age of 10-16 years. But if a 10 year old child is in STD 4, Vedantu does not let them participate in the VQuiz. Maybe also put a option in the app where we can enter our age as well. Everything else is great. Edit : Thank you for reading this review! Thank you also for responding.",
            "No app has ever annoyed me as much as this one . I have unistalled and re-installed it multiple times over this week and that too on multiple devices . But it just doesn't get logged in . It doesn't open no matter how many times I have tried it . I really wanted to use it and especially participate in the KBC for kids part. I would really appreciate it if someone can help me solve this issue ."

            "Enjoyed the app for a while but am unable to cancel it. Support won't respond to my emails and the subscription doesn't show up on my Google Play subscription page ti be canceled so I've been charged every month since November 2019 for something I don't want! Beware!",
            "I love this app. my 2 almost 3 year old girl seems to be very interested in trying to learn how to use it. I noticed her counting more however, she dose need alot of help because she dosent understand how to use it. my 5 year old finds it interesting and plays for a while on it and then loses interest. It just takes a little encouragement and he get back on it. its definitely overall great bc my 2 year old is learning.",
            "this game is amazing. it actually helps teach your kids. my son is 4 and about to start preschool, he has already counted to 20 all by himself after learning with this app. we will continue to use them.",
            "This app is amazing and sure helps my 5 year old son with math in a fun way!! He loves to learn and play games so this is a great way to do it! I highly recommend this app and it's so worth the price you pay for it!!"

            "Useless. GPS tracking does not work, tried everything, app usually gets stuck on loading, the features are not user friendly, very limited, very clunky. It's a really slow, limited and badly designed app with inadequate features .",
            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",
            "Can't even log in. It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later. And i could not even log into the app to change for fix anything. And the whole program does not work or link at all with my other son's ipad.",
            "I'm not very happy that Norton does not provide coverage for Microsoft Explorer. Also if you add a website to the unblocked list they are not unblocked immediately. They have a few kinks to work out for me."

            "As a guy, if you can look past the game revolving around Disney Princesses, this is arguably the best match 3/design game available in the Google Play Store. (And Ive tried most of them) So far the difficulty is just right and the graphics are vivid and crisp. Being able to choose portions of the story is a nice surprise as well. I hope the developers keep, well, developing.",
            "I like this game! Started playing it today! Now on hard level,becuase I'm very good at it! Its very challenging and I really like it! The reason why I rated it 4 stars because you have to wait 30 minutes to refill your lives and its really annoying! If you would reduce the time to refill your lives to only 15 seconds I would have rated it 5 stars! Otherwise,its a really good game!",
            "I love the game. What I don't like is that some of the tasks ask for up to 12 stars. That is way too much especially when you only get one star per win. Some of the levels are so hard that the only way to pass it is with power ups. I got to level 631 and there are no more levels. I still have tasks that need stars. Why can't Genie levels give out stars?",
            "Love it, but miss new levels. I had tried other similar games, and this is the first I've thoroughly enjoyed since Sailor Moon Drops was shut down. It has in curiosity sparking storyline with beloved princesses, and the graphics are cute and nostalgic. The gameplay is fun and challenging. While I appreciate the mini challenges available while awaiting new levels, they're feeling very repetitive after months of waiting. I miss the main game and feel I will never get to know the rest of the plot",
            "This game is awesome,just got it,I advice you to download it,you will not regret it,I'm also asking the makers of this game to please add a dressup and makeup section,so the game would really rock off, and be a number one game for girls, and for boys that think this game is only for girls,you've not tried thats why you think so,its really fun, my older brother really loves the game,and please the makers do consider my request,I'm giving you 5 stars, and thanks to disney for always making my day."

Head on over to check out everything we changed, but if you just can&#39;t bear to wait, here&#39;s a list of what&#39;s new for you:<br>*New Design for Parents Room with double cribs!<br>*Bigger living room and kitchen to accommodate more people! This means more chairs, more food, and even an extra corner for kids!<br>*The entire yard has been re-designed and it now includes a sand box, benches, and many more!<br>*And before we forget, we have new pets!",

            "I like it , and I also pretend that their talking , it's really, really , really fun , but something I don't like , it's when I go to every room there's an add , and also can you make your other my towns game , free like I get sad when there's paying because I don't know how to pay , and IAM only 9 years old , it's only childrens game pls make them freeüòûüò≠üòîüòêü•∫üôÅüôçüôé",
            "I loved my town able to have any character with no ads or unlocks which was money and same for the clothing and other items, but now most of the games cost money and not free almost every single character and clothing cost money or ads, and if their showing a little bit of skin it will give them a tank top which I find dumb, and it resets my progress so I have to rewatch ads, I really hope this is fixed for most of the games because I really like these games when I was young, thank you if you do",
            "What! Is this true I just thought it was best friends house OMG it's really like my town best friends house thank u my town for doing this amazing update and a small suggestion if u are giving games free then do some updates in that too (like renovating them) so that u will get more players u are marvelous!!",
            "I love your game, but what I see in this game my brother and sister got a car to go anywhere. But why I doesn't got the same. For the first time I buy this I really love it, but now not again..... So please fix this. And on the picture when I open the game I see my picture doesn't same like my brother and my sister too!!! Mine is wearing mask but my sister and brother not!!!!! Please fix this!!!!!!!!!üò°üò°üò°üò°üò§üò§",
            "I like this game but the reason behind I gave it 4 stars is that there are too......... Much adds in it . It is my favourite game . You also should also bring all the clothes you had in the closets . Only some clothes are free . If you don't mind, please make the app as it was , please . I like the old version more than this one . And please also free up all the characters. ( In all your games ) ."

        "description": "Show And Tell is a story creator, a simple and fun way to make stories and events using your tablet or phone. Kids, parents and teachers can use it to create your own story with pictures, video, sounds and text-to-speech. From kindergarten circle to special education, anyone can benefit from this new way of expressing memories and ideas.\r\n\r\nEach story is organized in pages with a picture, video and text. The pages can have a sound clip attached or text-to-speech interpretation. The  pictures and sounds can  be selected from device albums or recorded instantly. A draw and handwriting pad is available for Samsung Galaxy / Note S Pen. The stories can be added and edited with an easy to use  wizard. Fun effects can be added with the integrated Aviary photo editor. The stories can be saved as PDF and e-mailed.  The entire story can also be shared by email with other Show And Tell users.\r\n\r\nThis app is useful for young children, teens and even adults. It can be easily used as a photo album, a collection of children‚Äôs drawings, or a quick way to record travel memories. \r\n\r\nThe application is particularly useful for teachers, therapists and parents. It allows for quick creation of personalized sequenced stories, with the possibility of introducing own photographs, video, text and audio recording. The application is best suited for young children or children with reduced speech clarity, learning disabilities, autism, behavior difficulties, developmental disabilities and/or emerging  language abilities (nonverbal communication, speech therapy).\r\n \r\nShow and Tell provides the adults working with the children with a powerful tool to stimulate language, including comprehension, oral  expressive skills, reading and writing skills. The app can be used to create social narratives to depict common social problems or conflicts  and ways to address them in a socially acceptable way. The app allows for maximum flexibility on the part of the adult designing the story  for the child. For example, if the teacher chose to draw small figurines on paper to depict emotions and actions, then a picture can be taken  and ‚Äúvoila‚Äù, a story was created which can then be used over and over again, until the target behavior  is learned. \r\n\r\nThe app allows the user to create sequenced stories which are often key for early language and literacy development. The stories created can  be used as a basis for expanding conversations, introducing the story elements to the child or introducing more details and richness to the conversational exchange. \r\n\r\nThe stories can be used to support children with severe articulation disorders, oral language difficulties, nonverbal or autistic children. The parents or teacher may create simple stories to depict an activity that the child has done, then use the app to allow the child to share the information with others, familiar or  unfamiliar peers and adults, in order to expand the range of people that the child communicates with. \r\n\r\nIf the focus is on Vocabulary and concept development, the teacher or parent may take pictures of multiple objects depicting a concept that  is a focus for the child  (such as colors, numbers, sizes, etc), then create a quick story for the child to refer to. \r\n\r\nThe app may be used to create early literacy individualized alphabet books to aid children who are struggling to make the connection between  the letters and their respective sounds through association with pictures of personally meaningful things. A familiar voice recording would increase familiarity  and ensure faster connections are made.  \r\n\r\nChildren with working memory difficulties may benefit from the stories created with Show and Tell to replay a sequence of familiar events for  quick reference. For example, a child may use a story which replays the steps required to do a pen and paper exercise in class or homework. \r\n \r\nA demo version is available on Google Play, search \"wsisat\" and select Show And Tell Demo.",

            "Thanks Brothers, I love JW app üíóüíóüíó However, recently I am experiencing an issue with it and I am wondering if you would be able to help me please. It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet ü§óüíñ",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

The instructions are clear, and concise, unlike some other math games we have tried. There are some many things to do he never gets bored when he is practicing. The 'practice' is definitely on grade level. It is worth upgrading to a premium account.",

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "Pretty decent app especially compared to similar ones out there. Expected delivery to take forever but was impressed it only took roughly a week (at least in the UK). Every single item is packed neatly and individually, quality so far was amazing, clothing so soft and the size right on point! Love all the discounts! There is room for improvement, such as the filters which don't always work (when choosing to see only a certain size, age etc), but overall I'm impressed and will keep on buying!",
            "The filters don't always work well which can be frustrating. The sizing of the clothes are not consistent. You also don't always get what is pictured. For e.g. I thought I was getting a set but it was only a top. I bought several items and satisfied with about half of what I received. Still on the fence about ordering again even with a voucher they sent me.",
            "I love shopping with PatPat! I'm Australian, so I was surprised how quick shipping is. The quality of clothing is great and the range of bright coloured clothing for boys is brilliant! It's so great to see an affordable clothing company doing bright clothing for boys rather than the boring blues, greys and browns you usually have to choose from at most shops. They have awesome sales too. I've been receiving lots of comments from strangers about my son's cool clothing.",
            "I like the clothes but the quality of some dresses is good and some not that good. And patpat made some levels if you reach that level you will receive some gift voucher every month but unfortunately they are not doing it, they have provided 1 month after that we need to chase them for the rewards. Instead of understanding customer querry they just want to debate with customers, I feel it's unprofessional and they need to improve customer service."

        "title": "Autism:How to Help your Child",
        "description": "If your child -- or the child of a close friend or relative -- has just received a diagnosis of autism, you are probably feeling baffled and overwhelmed. It is never easy to learn that someone you love has a serious health or developmental condition. Learning all you can about the disorder -- and where to get help -- will ease your fear and confusion. It can also provide the tools you need to find the support that children with autism -- and you -- really need.\r\n\r\nHow to Identify Children With Autism\r\nAutism is a developmental disorder that appears in early childhood. Autism is the most common condition in a related constellation of disorders known as autism spectrum disorders, also called ASDs. Other autism spectrum disorders include Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder, or PDD. Autism and other autism spectrum disorders can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms and degree of impairment -- ranging from mild to severe -- are different for every child.\r\n\r\nSome features of autism include:\r\n\r\nSocial withdrawal\r\nVerbal or nonverbal communication problems\r\nRigid and repetitive behavior\r\nIn severe cases, an autistic child may never learn to speak or make eye contact. But many children with autism and other autism spectrum disorders are able to live relatively normal lives.\r\nSigns and Symptoms in Children With Autism\r\nAutism usually appears before a child is 3 years old. Some signs of autism may be evident as early as 10 to 12 months, and certainly by 18 months.\r\n\r\nVarying widely, signs and symptoms in children with autism typically include:\r\n\r\nImpaired communication skills\r\nDifficulty making eye contact\r\nRepetitive behaviors and activities such as arm flapping, head banging, or twirling an object over and over\r\nRigid behavior and difficulty with change and transitions\r\nNarrow range of interests and activities\r\nWhat Causes Autism?\r\nExperts do not know exactly what causes autism. In the past, people blamed parenting practices, which added a burden of guilt and shame on parents already struggling to cope with a disabled child. Today, most scientists believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors cause autism.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent research confirms multiple genetic abnormalities that can predisposition someone to autism. Several genes have been implicated. In addition, there may be metabolic or biochemical factors that can cause autism spectrum disorders. Other research is looking at environmental triggers, including exposure to certain viruses. But a number of comprehensive studies have totally disproved the purported link between vaccines and ASD.\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of diagnosed cases of autism in the U.S. and around the world. Experts do not know if this is because the disorder is actually on the rise, or if doctors are simply diagnosing it more effectively. We should learn more answers to questions like these over the next few years. That's because many researchers are currently looking into autism's origins, prevalence, and treatment.",

        "comments": [
            "While this game can be quite fun at times with the various characters, attractions, and events, the fact that it is basically a neverending money-sucker really takes away from the fun. Most of the Disney characters need to be bought with real money, usually at $10 each go. Then you get a chance of getting some characters, but it isn't guaranteed. I've honestly dumped about $50 into this game and IT IS NOT WORTH IT. It's like a digital pyramid scheme.",
            "With the latest update, they made one of the game currencies (magic) so much harder to obtain. They continue to make events impossible for players who aren't willing to spend their entire paycheck. With each new terrible update, I wonder why I'm still playing. If the next update doesn't remedy the many problems they've introduced, it'll be time to delete. It used to be fun, but man have they taken the joy out of it recently.",
            "My last issue was fixed but now I can't stand how you can now only use 75 characters at a time.... I don't want to keep my characters locked up and like to use them all... with this new update it is even harder to get what is needed to level up characters and with having so many characters forced to be locked up you can't get as much magic! Let me use all my characters already!!!!!!!",
            "could be great. Sounds like it was. Everything takes a ton of time to do, and its a pain collecting for characters. Game only seems possible if you drop a lot of money and a lot of time. For example, Prince Charming. to unlock him took me a bit because I was missing a set of gloves, but finally got him. Did one quest, then I had to level him up which took a while again. Did one quest, and now I have to do all that over and level him up yet again. All about spending real money.",
            "So I love playing this game. But the new update that limits the number of characters allowed out in the park at one time is stupid. I absolutely hate it. Please change it back to letting unlimited number of characters in the park. Also increase magic rewards and more chances for character scrolls would be nice. Park expansion seems a bit high for some parts as well. And bring Ratatouille To the game!!!!"

            "Brilliant!! Interactive, educational and genuinely fun. My 6 year old loves this app and uses it daily. It helped her to master her times tables where other apps have failed. Even her teacher is astounded at her progress in such a short period of time. I'm so happy we found this app as u was starting to tear my hair out! Thanks, Zapzapmath!",
            "Got this app for my 1st grader to practice multiplication and its helped but he seems to still struggle progressing from one level to another. I like that the game starts easy for kids and builds on it and also the choices for each multiplication puzzle narrows which is good. I'd like to see better reward system on the app to keep kids motivated to come back daily.",
            "This is a fun exciting way to help your little ones learn math. It was nice to hear my daughter laughing and giggling while working on some problems. Very easy and little parent interaction is needed.",
            "My kids have so much fun playing this. They love to advance levels and try to increase their score.",
            "FUN AND VERY INTERESTING Very easy to set up, the multi player option makes it very interesting and keeps multiple kids entertained. Kids get to choose various Avatars and Characters, very simple to understand and had so much fun playing with the kids that we didn't feel the time passing. Great way to give kids some screen time and make it useful, LOVE IT and highly recommend it. üëåüèº"

            "Great games for kids to learn math while playing video games. My eldest enjoys the games but he does struggle with some of them.",
            "it is realy good i like the creativity but try to add more things",
            "Gives the wrong answers. The very 1st question it asked had the wrong answer. Which would you use to make .001 into .01 (x10 or √∑10) the correct answer is x10 but it said that made 1 and that the correct answer was √∑10 but that makes .0001. So I have to hate an app that is teaching wrong."

        "description": "Mam, childhood is a period of growth and development that is important in the lives of every human being. In this period, children learn to master certain skills and deal with new tasks. Therefore, Mam needs to pay close attention to the various development processes that take place in the life of the Little One in this period; starting from the child's cognitive development, motor, sensory, physical, language, and emotional.\r\nCognitive can be interpreted as the ability to understand something. Cognitive development refers to the ability a child has to understand something. One of the psychology figures who put forward a theory about the stages of cognitive development (cognitive theory) of humans is Jean Piaget. According to Piaget, children have a different way of thinking from adults. Piaget divides the stages of early childhood cognitive development into four stages.\r\n1. Sensorimotor stage (0-24 months)\r\nEvery baby is born with innate reflexes and the urge to explore his world. Therefore, at this time, the baby's abilities are limited to his reflexes and five senses. The various reflexes then develop into habits. At this initial stage of cognitive development, the Little can not consider the needs, desires, or interests of others, so he is considered \"egocentric\".\r\n2. Preoperational stage (2-7 years)\r\nAt this time, children can begin to receive stimulation, although it is still very limited. Even Little has entered into the social environment. The hallmark of this stage is that children begin to be able to use mental operations that are rarely and logically inadequate.\r\n3. Concrete operational stage (7-11 years)\r\nAt this time, children are able to sort and classify certain objects and situations. The ability to remember and think logically the little one is increasing. He is able to understand the concept of cause and effect rationally and systematically so that the little one can start learning mathematics and reading. At this stage also the character \"egocentric\" Little disappears slowly. He is now able to see a problem or event from another person's point of view.\r\n4. Formal operational stage (starting at age 11)\r\nAt this time, children are able to think abstractly and master reasoning. He can draw conclusions from the available information. He can understand abstract concepts such as love and values. Little can also see the reality is not always black and white, but there is also a \"gray gradation\" in between. This ability is important, Mam, because it will help her get through the transition from adolescence to adulthood or the real world.",

            "Wont open comes to a page saying not found then loops back to google play Update contacted Google for refund, Google said contact developer. Developer says contact google. Thanks for the run around on an expensive non working app.",
            "Very supportive and responsive support. App has an easy to use UI for communication and seems to be quite customizable. The PIN function to restrict changes to settings is very useful. It does install all images locally but that also allows the app full functionality even when not connected to the internet. The app comes with multiple different page layouts on installation, and has the ability to create custom pages as well. However, I did have to explore myself the various settings and options available in the app, and how they changed the functionality and interface of the app. The degree of customization is great, such as custom buttons with personal images and sound recordings for true personalization of expression but these options can feel a little overwhelming for those that are unfamiliar with AAC apps or communication apps in general. Some sort of in app onboarding to help new users customize the app to their communication needs where new users can view the default page types/layouts easily when they first start the app, and a help/guide function or library explaining the different options available to users as far as customization and control goes would be very helpful. If there is a manual included in the application, it is not easily located. Otherwise, this app suits our needs perfectly, and I would definitely recommend this app.",
            "Wonderful speech app and incredible customer service. We've been using Proloquo2go for years and with each new version it is increasingly difficult to use, NO customer support in the US, and is so ridiculously expensive. Our school recommended TalkTablet and we are so much happier now. It has been a breath of fresh air. So much easier and more intuitive to use. No comparison. And the fellow we called at TalkTablet with some questions, before and after purchasing was outstanding 5*",
            "I am a community support worker who supports many people with speech difficulties of different types. This app is by far the best app in versatility, usability, and price. Customer support is the best that I've found, you accually get to talk to a real person if there are any questions which have been far and few in between do to the extreme user friendliness of this app. I can't say enough good things about the creater of this program, it has changed many people's lives.

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

Children will learn how to identify easier fully-formed emotions and more difficult subtle emotions. The game is highly customizable to meet the needs of children with varying skills, ability levels, and learning styles.\r\n\r\nThis game was designed by Dr Holly Gastgeb, a clinical and developmental psychologist with over ten years of experience working with typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Her research has shown that children with ASD have difficulty identifying emotions from an early age. Since this ability is developed throughout childhood, the game is beneficial for a wide range of children including early achievers without any diagnosed learning difficulties.\r\n\r\nLearn with Rufus: Feelings and Emotions is organized into a learning phase and two games:\r\n‚Ä¢ Learning - A preview of the facial expressions is shown to the child before the game starts.\r\n‚Ä¢ Find It! - Shown a number of facial expressions, the child is directed to select a specific emotion.\r\n‚Ä¢ Name It! - Shown a single facial expression, the child is asked to name the emotion.\r\n\r\nTo keep children interested and motivated, the following features are included:\r\n‚Ä¢ Reward sets - Choose from nine different colorful child-friendly reward sets including bugs, cars, cats, and more.\r\n‚Ä¢ Toy break - The child is given periodic breaks with fun on-screen fingerpainting. This feature can be turned off if the child does not need breaks or finds them distracting.\r\n‚Ä¢ Positive reinforcement - Rufus does a \"happy dance\" and gives positive verbal reinforcement when the child answers correctly. If the child answers incorrectly, the correct answer is restated.\r\n‚Ä¢ Music and sounds - Child-friendly music and sounds are included. This feature can be turned off if the child is sensitive to or distracted by sounds and music.\r\n‚Ä¢ Text - The word that corresponds to each picture is presented above the picture. This feature can be turned off if the words are distracting to the child.\r\n‚Ä¢ Emoticons - Emoticons that correspond to the emotions are presented. This feature can be turned off to increase difficulty.\r\n\r\nAdditional customizable features that are present include:\r\n‚Ä¢ Level of difficulty - The level of difficulty can be adjusted to match the child's ability level:\r\nEasy - Facial expressions with quickly identifiable emotions\r\nMedium - Facial expressions with a mix of slightly less identifiable emotions\r\nHard - Facial expressions with partially formed emotions\r\nExpert - Facial expressions with subtle emotions\r\n‚Ä¢ Training - The practice session before the games may be disabled to increase difficulty.\r\n‚Ä¢ Group Size - Choose from a group size for the game phase depending on the child's ability level. Group size can be 2 or 4 for Find It! and group size can be 2, 4, or 6 for Name It!\r\n‚Ä¢ Languages - Choose from English and Spanish.\r\n\r\nFor parents, educators, and therapists:\r\n‚Ä¢ Profiles per child - More than one child can play the game and all data is stored under each child's name.\r\n‚Ä¢ Track data and statistics - At the end of the game, a graph of the child's data is presented.

One request is to have a persistent notification while the timer is running so the user can quickly check the time left if on another app. Love that you can keep the screen awake!",

But it works, it's consistent, and has helped me with my problems of knowing that time is passing. If you have ADHD or any other condition with a similar time impairment, I recommend it.",
            "It's a nice feature. I hope they can add pomodoro function too with asking if we want go proceed to the next session which can be great for project or simply doing a routine with a smooth transition between tasks with necessary breaks as some of us may forget to take a break. Add more variety of colors too! Also adding a widget would be nice and/or having a visual timer on the notification beside the text when away from the app.",

I have have always wanted time timer on a smart watch and now I see you have finally released it on apple watch.

            "This game is ok I would never play this in my freetime, and I don't like the animaton. It's terrible and the animation sucks! It looks like the creator just rushed it when it could have been a good game but you rushed it. If your pregnant and you want to learn about being pregnant I do recommend, but for all of you that are not, look at something else!!!",
            "The is perfect for pregnant women. It teaches you everything i am very proud of the creators. But the reason i reduced a star because you cannot operate the woman that's a little disappointing. Creators if you are reading this its a humble request to add this feature please please. I love this game and i dont want to uninstall it.",
            "Very good game...portrays a pregnant mother's life accurately. Excellent! The only thing is that I felt the 'Baby Care' level a bit boring. The rest was all excellent! Going to hospital, ordering items from iPhone....very good. Just improve 'Baby Care' level and then include more and more of levels...overall, nice game!üëçüëç sufficient to get 4 stars!!",
            "FINALLY A GAME WITH EASY CONTROLS !!!!!! I love this game I just wish it had more levels and more to do so far everything is so accurate! Maybe giving baby a bath more levels of baby getting older feeding him in a high chair changing clothes etc mom cooking going to the store taking baby for a walk in stroller or if baby grows and walks as a toddler take him to play ! I'm just glad theres no timer either ! I totally love this game so I'll keep it downloaded and wait for more levels ! Great game!",
            "This app is amazing the little details are so incredible! It feels so realistic however there are some small issues in my opinion I don't understand why when you buy clothes on the pregnancy app it shows dresses and a t-shirt, if she can only wear the track suits why not just have her buy the track suits instead of the dresses? Also it's a little annoying that when you have a baby boy he's in a super girly nursery I think all the baby stuff should had been made gender neutral. Great game tho!"

            "Great game...BUT! Had issues with this game a year ago, but thought I'd give it another go. Graphics and game play are excellent, however I bought credits (AU$70), bet big, won free games (Where's The Gold) then the game froze. Restarted it, recovered the game then froze again. Restarted it, same thing. Third time it just took the free games. No reply from support. You bet big with the hope of winning free games, then it takes away your prize.",
            "This app has the best graphics....but thats it. I've tried buying credits etc to 'pay my way' for better payouts, but all Product Madness are concerned about is making you pay more for something worthless. There is no way you can win any money back, its supposed to be for fun, but you have to pay big ongoing premiums to have any 'fun'. Until l see a better return on the money I've paid so far, they'll not get another penny out of me. You are better off saving your money for real gambling.",
            "I keep wanting to give this game more stars, but they just wont let me. Yes I'm very happy that you put way better values on the daily wheel. Yes I play this game because the games are ones I've played in real casinos...i can't give more than one star because you just make it impossible to win anything...when you go through 5 million coins betting minimum and never get a bonus or win anything higher than double your bet you just want to give up. Plus, the cost of buying coins is ridiculous.",
            "I think its great , you know it costs them money to put these games on here, so to anyone that's not happy just remember these games are free, and entertaining , And it takes our minds off of today's problems, Tomas blanco",
            "Total scam. Fixed games and they expect you to pay for credits? Games don't pay, stupid and totally unnecessary side games (open boxes for items or scratch fixed lottery tickets). The only good thing about this app is that the games look like the real deal but the overall experience is terrible."
