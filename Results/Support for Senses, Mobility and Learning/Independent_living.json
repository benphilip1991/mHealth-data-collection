It's not a digital newspaper it's an ebook downloaded at best.

This broad term encompasses such services as assisted living, adult day care, long term care, nursing homes (often referred to as residential care), hospice care, and home care. Because of the wide variety of elderly care found nationally, as well as differentiating cultural perspectives on elderly citizens, cannot be limited to any one practice. For example, many countries in Asia use government-established elderly care quite infrequently, preferring the traditional methods of being cared for by younger generations of family members.\r\n\r\nElderly care emphasizes the social and personal requirements of senior citizens who need some assistance with daily activities and health care, but who desire to age with dignity. It is an important distinction, in that the design of housing, services, activities, employee training and such should be truly customer-centered. It is also noteworthy that a large amount of global elderly care falls under the unpaid market sector.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of caring for the elderly is to love them and keep them active. There are many different ways to care for the elderly, whether by caring for them in the comfort of their own homes, bringing them to your home or moving them to a senior center.\r\n\r\nThe information provided in this app is well filtered and revised to accommodate the need to make it as easy to the users as possible, after all you wouldn't want to ditch further only to pick up another in the name of a simple guide.\r\n\r\nWe hope you find the app useful and worth your time, send us your feedback and suggestion on how to improve our app.\r\n\r\nLastly, please take a moment to rate this app if at all you find it beneficial.",

        "description": "In this modern world many elderly people live alone and families are spread out, living in different towns and countries. The app helps make it easier for families to care for a loved one – no matter where they are.\r\n\r\nThe app helps a family detect if a loved one is struggling. For example, it tells you if they are becoming forgetful or not maintaining their regular daily routines, such as remembering to take medicine. And it tells you if their physical activity is decreasing. It’s important to detect a decrease in physical activity because if they don’t receive some additional help then they could be at an increased risk of having a fall or suffer with reduced independence.\r\n\r\nThe app is technically advanced and features multiple built-in phone sensors. These sensors can give a family an advance warning that a loved one is struggling and lets you respond to ensure they receive the care they need.\r\n\r\nA built-in motion sensor automatically lets the family know when (say) Grandmother moves or picks up her phone. In the morning it is reassuring to receive a message telling you your loved one has woken up at their regular time. And if you don’t get the message you know to call her and check everything is ok. \r\n\r\nThe app lets you setup daily recurring reminders for your loved one, for example, at 10:00 every morning your Grandfather’s phone has a notification to (say) reminder him to take medicine. And you receive a message when they do it. It helps you to see if a person is maintaining their regular daily routines.  You can set this up from your phone – and select the reminders and tasks to appear on your loved ones phone. \r\n\r\nMobile phones and tablets offer many benefits but for some older adults they struggle to use them as part of their daily lives. Perhaps they forget to charge the battery or they don’t keep it close by for when they need it (the phone is left untouched and forgotten).  The app helps a family to support a loved one to establish and maintain a daily routine of having a phone charged and close by. The app tells you if your loved ones phone battery gets low and it tells you when they charge their phone – so you can call and remind them if they forget to charge their phone.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed to help your elderly loved one with ‘everyday living’. The term ‘Everyday Living’ is incredibly important and encompasses:  (i) remaining socially engaged; (ii) continuing with activities that give life meaning; (iii) contributing to family or community; (iv) not feeling ‘burdensome’ to their families; and (v) continuing the role as caregiver.\r\n\r\nThe app links phones together to create a safe private group that helps people share, care and keeps people in touch.  The apps built-in sensors mean an elderly relative receives a continuous stream of family news feed events from their children and grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nPlease ask all your family to download the app and join your private group.\r\n\r\nWe hope you find the app useful. Please send us your feedback and suggestions on how to improve our app.\r\n\r\nLastly, please take a moment to rate this app if you find it beneficial.",

            "I was enjoying the app until I tried to play with the puzzle game. There is a problem with moving the pieces in to place. I could not get them to. move. It was like they were stuck to my screen. No matter; how hard I pushed, nothing moved. Most annoying; also as I got up to 7 and higher my scores went down and by accident I solved your problems. I turned my phone upside down and the pieces would move where I wanted them to go. My score should have been high and no negative reply.",
            "Too many ads that play too long! This app is marketed for seniors, but some of the ads are not. Also, the app should have some \"helps.\" I'm stuck on an upper level of a puzzle game and can't advance or do anything because I can't solve the puzzle. Ready to uninstall this app.",
            "Every (often less than 30 seconds) a 30 second advertising clip even for the very first level does not give one the chance to give the game a reasonable try if it would be worth buying. (-2 stars) Make at least the first 4-5 levels of each game ad-free so people could test the app. Another star lost to directly sending the users to the app-store / installers, very bad for an app targeting also children. Last point: Am I lost, or is there nowhere an exit-button?",
            "The games are challenging but who can be bothered when your screen is taken over by a long time after a very short time of play. Wordscapes should know that hell will freeze over before I'd download their app. Freeze just like they keep freezing my screen.Uninstalling , I don't recommend this one."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "I am so thankful that someone told me about Senior Safety App,, it has already help me , I have fallen several and it' works. I need to know how to fine tune the sensitive part, sometimes when I lay it on the bed it goes off. It's a real blessing to me. Thank you for creating this app Bob Miller",
            "I have started using the Senior Safety App to monitor my father's movement. He is having the onset of dementia. So far, I find the app is quite helpful. I am monitoring the battery life of his cellphone, and I really liked the feature where I can add up to 5 emergency contact numbers; these numbers will be called one after another during an emergency. It really gives you peace of mind.",
            "My grandmother has dementia. And the one thing that upsets her and causes panic attacks is loud noise. Dementia has made the effects of sensory changes like light and noise worse. Therefore, she gets anxious when her external environment gets too noisy. We tried everything. Finally, we found the Senior Safety App with its ability to alert us to fact that her surroundings are getting noisy before she panics. This app has helped me improve her quality of life.",
            "My frail grandmother is 90 years old. Even though she stays in a nursing home, I installed the Senior Safety App on her phone to monitor her movements. If she falls and can’t get up, she presses the app’s SOS button. I phone the home and someone checks on her. The nursing home staff have been incredibly busy and stressed due to the lockdown. So, they appreciate the help. And I have peace of mind; my beloved grandmother is getting the best care possible."

            "This would be an excellent app I can tell by the amount of thought that went into it. I downloaded it first realizing too late that it only serves Trenton NJ area. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of this. I wish they would've stated that up front on the APP store info page. Very disappointing, I was SO much looking forward to utilizing it. As the user friendly, simple interface appeared awesome. Sorry had to uninstall as it was useless to me due to living in southeast.",
            "I LIKE THE APP SETUP BUT ITS ONLY GOOD FOR 2 CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY TRENTON NJ & LA, CA. IF YOU CAN MAKE IT GO NATIONWIDE YOU WOULD GET 2 FIVE STARS I KNOW @ LEAST 2 PEOPLE THAT USE THIS APP IF IT GOES NATION WIDE",
            "Uninstalled."

My sister in memory care is 12 hrs. away, so I love the pictures they send but other than that the app is kind of a nuisance. 2 days after the May 27 2020 update the Caremerge app indicates my password is wrong and dosen't recognize my email address for recovery.

It helps me decide when to visit my dad. Inconveniences: you have to login every time you use the app even though there's no sensitive data in it; you cannot save a location, even though there's a menu choice to show preferred locations; there's no help of any kind.",

When they allow fingerprint login or the option to stay logged in between reboots it will be an excellent app."

Among the labyrinth of empty streets, survivors fortify camps to resist zombie hordes, and venture outside to discover the cause of the infection that left the world in a state of survival.\r\n\r\nYou are one of the few survivors whose destiny is directly related to these events. In your life after the apocalypse, you'll deal with hunger and thirst, look for other survivors' camps, and spend your dark days crafting your own shelter from gathered materials. Investigate the causes of the infection that triggered the apocalypse by completing quests. Explore the darkest corners of the City to craft unique armor and weapons. Build vehicles that will grant you access to secret areas.\r\n\r\nConfront other survivors, greedy for the loot you carry.

            "This is a slow process game. But it will keep you entertained. The graphics are decent and as well as the player movement. But with the new update and the maps change. Some of the items you get are inside the buildings. Which there is no way of getting to. You lose hunger and hydration to fast. The research to do more then 1 material at a time is kinda annoying. I would suggest lowering that a bit. Also getting a better backpack in the begining as well. Thank you hope to change rating soon.",
            "Overall, it's OK. Good game, but with a few bugs that needs some tweaks. My problem is just that when I was on a pvp area, I got disconnected. When I logged back in, I LOST ALL MY STUFF. I'm literally at the area WITHOUT ANY OF MY STUFF. This might be a bug or something as I didn't die, yet lost everything in my inventory. Devs, please fix this, just please.",
            "Game is slow to advance it's very difficult to get anywhere or generate resources .plus you lose all resource once your killed whic makes it even more impossible unless you purchase there packets which does you no good once you killed . So if you want to waist your time and repeat the same slow going process over and over with out spending a fortune just to lose everything you just purchased have at it. Oh and one more thing every enemy no mater what size or level is stronger than you ,faster",
            "1 star, the New update destroyed the game. Instead of adding new multilayer and trading options they made the existing trading/pvp systems much worse. Also removed free options for farming to be replaced by new pay to play farming options. Peel back this update and create real multi-player options for your game or watch it die. Seriously like 30% of your players quit overnight. Idiots.",
            "My last review of this game wasn't great but they need to fix the connection lost issues. The network connectivity in this game is the worst I have experienced so far. For a game with multiplayer features, it's connection issues is very bad and I have a fibre broadband at home and this issue still persist especially with watching ads for more loot which is good but if connecting afterwards takes over 20 seconds and the enemies can attack you while this is happening is just terrible. FIX IT!"

Waste of money!!",

I couldn't remember my password and they wanted me to enter the first 6 numbers and the last 4 of my credit card. If I do that just to reset my password, I might as well enter the entire 16 numbers. I blocked the card. I don't have to worry about renewal of the subscription. For what they offer, I come out better getting a man from under a bridge.",

These could have a positive effect on your living experience if they are looked at properly. \r\n\r\nApartments for rent \r\nAs compared to purchasing a home, apartments for rent is always one of the best options and easy. So the moment you rent any apartment you certainly can enjoy a number of benefits.\r\n\r\nHouses for rent \r\nA house for rent by owner is a business, and you have to manage it like any other business.

It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign state following the end of the British Raj in 1947. Pakistan came into existence as a result of the Pakistan Movement, which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state in the north-western regions of South Asia via partition. The movement was led by the All-India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The event was brought forth by the Indian Independence Act 1947 under which the British Raj gave independence to the Dominion of Pakistan which comprised West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). In the Islamic calendar, the day of independence coincided with Ramadan 27, the eve of which, being Laylat al-Qadr, is regarded as sacred by Muslims.\r\n\r\nThe main Independence Day ceremony takes place in Islamabad, where the national flag is hoisted at the Presidential and Parliament buildings. It is followed by the national anthem and live televised speeches by leaders.

A number of award ceremonies are often held on this day, and Pakistanis hoist the national flag atop their homes or display it prominently on their vehicles and attire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1946, the Labour government in Britain, exhausted by recent events such as World War II and numerous riots, realized that it had neither the mandate at home, the support internationally, nor the reliability of the British Indian Army for continuing to control an increasingly restless British India.\r\n\r\nAlso search By:\r\n\r\nPakistan flag photo 14 August\r\n14 august 2017\r\nPakistan Flag Wallpaper\r\nPakistan Independence Frames\r\nIndependence Day Pakistan\r\nPakistan Flag Wallpapers\r\nPakistan Flag Wallpaper\r\nPakistan Flag Photo Frame Free\r\n14 august 2017 sms\r\nPakistan Independence Frame\r\nPakistan Flag Photo Editor\r\n14 august sms\r\npak independence day sms\r\npak independence day images\r\npak independence day wallpaper\r\npak independence day 2017 wallpaper\r\npak independence day gif\r\npak independence day photos\r\npak independence day songs 2017\r\nhappy pak independence day 2017\r\nPak Independence Day Images\r\n14 august 2017 gif\r\n14 august songs\r\n14 august gif\r\n14 aug 2017\r\n14 august 2017 images\r\n14 august 2017 wallpaper",

            "Terrible! I bought this last year and it worked fine but the subscription ran out. I paid the renewal fee but it won't register. I cannot log in because I am rerouted to the subscribe page. I was able to call last week, after 4 tries I found a number that let me talk to a live agent. They said it was a known issue but have still not corrected issue or refunded me. Now when I call I only get a bot who won't let me talk to a live agent. Google won't help. DO NOT USE THIS APP! Wasted $$$ REALLY KYLE???? Do you think I haven't already done this? Please do a little research before you send fake help. I am escalating this to the corporate level.",
            "I have been waiting over a year for a response to my initial query. The ONLY way to use QBSE on my phone is to install it, make whatever transaction, then uninstall it. It only works one time per installation. Auto track is toggled on but my mileage is not tracked. It is not calculating my taxes properly. I can only use web version. The only part that works perfectly, every time, without fail, is billing. When Intuit charges me for using QBSE, the transaction is flawless and error-free.",
            "So Many issues. It's the least user friendly software and I spend most of my time trying to fix issues caused by the system itself. Most recently I want to login with my password and not fingerprint as it is unreliable. To remove my finger print I need to use my fingerprint. If that was possible I wouldn't want to remove it would I. It won't let me prove my identity with a password just locks after not recognising my finger prints. Another day another issue with QuickBooks.",
            "After the last update, it will no longer work. Everytime I try to use the app. It glitches out . Getting ahold of customer service is very difficult. The automated prompt will kick you off and make you go to the website , To ask for answers and the automated system their cant help either.",
            "Lots of issues, no help I keep categorising items marked \"uncategorised\". Then when I go back later the same items are marked \"uncategorised\". I have done everything the help service has asked, clear cache, search history etc. Same problem. Then because they didn't know what to do they just stopped answering. I will be looking to get a full return for the entire year as its now completely useless"

On 2020 model samsung galaxy tab a (tablet) the app is constantly freezing and is super frustrating for child. This is a paid product, unacceptable quality. Too bad, because I'm willing to pay for quality edu products as a homeschooler. Signed up for their 2-month free trial, thankfully have not actually paid yet or it would probably be a fight to get my money back.",
            "Signed up today and I'm so unhappy with this. It was not loading on the tablet, just kept hanging the first activity we tried. We decided to try the website instead. He got through one activity, then whenever we clicked another, it would just kick us back to the homepage. We cleared cache and tried again, but that didn't help. Restarted the computer, same problem. Eventually my kid was so frustrated he asked to watch a movie instead. Worse than a Beta, not worth paying for.",

What a waste of money! if there were proper regulation this device wouldn't be allowed to sell in bookshops! i can't believe indigo was selling this \"thing\" !",

            "Giving it a 3 star because the newest update totally changed the look of the app and its awful. It works, it's fine, if you download it now you may like it not having seen it as before. But as someone thats been using this app for years...two thumbs way way down on the updated look. Its not easy on the eyes, the ads on the bottom are a wicked turn off, just overall disappointed. Wish I didn't update it.",
            "Used to be really good because it was simple. Now the minimalist design was replaced with 2 new features that have no tutorial or detailed explanation on how to properly use. Here's the problem, there's too much inputting and figuring out. Blocks vs Routines vs Programmer? I preferred simply making different weeks, copying them and slightly alternating them if anything pops up.",
            "Really enjoyed this app, but was disappointed to find it doesn't automatically sync your schedule to your account. I had to reset my phone and was bummed to see the schedule, routines, and tags I worked on for days, tweaking it to fit my kid's days perfectly was gone. Not sure I will take the time to redo it and will probably not use the app anymore although I really did like it. If you do use it, just make sure you back up your schedule!!",
            "It's fairly good. I'm mainly posting this review to suggest that timetune pro be a monthly subscription of a dollar. Some people might not go for that but in reality it would help the developers to be better funded so they could make the app the best of its kind. Is timetune the best? no. Its potential is incredible though and I really like the approach and Design.",
            "Hi TimeTune, I love your app since then. I just have a problem. I don't know how to fix the blockage of TimeTune app on my Infinix Hot 9. Your site for troubleshooting is not accessible for me. Overall this app is fine and satisfying. Edit. Troubleshooting doesn't work on Infinix Hot 9. Hoping for its inclusion on troubleshooting sites. Edit. I can't find any forums. I am hoping for more improvements in the future. I'll be reinstalling the app after the update."

It is not a one time fee, but a recurring fee. This basically ruins the app. The only reason i have 2* is the developer helped me with some data issues i had a few years ago, and i still appreciate that. I would pay a one time fee to remove ads forever, because i like the simple functionality, but now...uninstall.",
            "Great app that's very easy to use. Wonderful customer service. Developer encourages and welcomes ideas; I've asked him for help before with a particular tracking issue that was (seemed) specific to me. I appreciate that he responded so quickly and took the extra effort to dig deeper into the problem and collaborate in in order to find a solution if possible. Exceptional Service.",
            "I love this app and it's extremely helpful come tax season. However I noticed that all of my entries from 2019 have disappeared and I need those back for my records. Is it possible to retrieve them? I will update my rating accordingly.",
            "I use this everyday I work. Super organized and easy to use. Also, when covid shut down everything, the app had information about it and also notified me that there was a grant I could apply for specifically for servers that got me $500 extra."

The video section and news channels will make you glad you took a solid step into the light and out of the darkness of the legacy media. Highest recommendation.",
            "Great app, up-to-date news with excellent research and reporting involved, especially as it concerns China, which had otherwise kicked out or sent money to most major networks. I would have given it less stars, as I don't like the subscription price ($5 a month or no fee and some ads would be better) but I don't read many more than the few 'free articles' advertised as the option for non-subscribers.",
            "My my favorite news source! real news. In a world filled with fake news the Epoch Times stands out. The Epoch Times has held on to the original spirit of the news, sharing the facts with the people. They go after the stories the corrupt mainstream media and turned a blind eye to as it does not fit their agenda. The Epoch Times does not do this. Prepare for a breath of fresh air as you read some real news by real journalists about real events happening in our world. Thank you Epoch Times.",
            "Was a great app! I was really enjoying it till the sneaky upgrade now limits you and now has ads AND forces you to subscribe! $77 special rate and then $192 /yr??? ...for an app??? You lost me. I will be deleting like many others. No thanks!",
            "my very favorite source of news. Easy to scroll down through the stories and click on the one I'm interested in. I love that I can scroll down through a story and find a video click on along with the names I need to go on YouTube for the research. I prefer to listen to the actual people rather than having people tell me what they think that person said and the epoch times has been my best source of obtaining the names behind the story."

I tried password rest did not fix, and tried to recreate account with same email which the system didn't recognize. Contacted Support/developer and they did not respond. Reporting to google headquarters next. Update: Got some kind of an automated email asking to complete profile and when click it opens up to have loaded website with no where to click",
            "This app could eventually be very good, but it needs some serious interface updates to make it user friendly. Currently my post of services has been viewed over 1,100 times, it's only been saved once, and I've been contacted zero times. The problem lies in the fact that the results when browsing aren't organized by location or category. People in CA or TX are viewing my post about contractor work in IL. I'd check back in 6 months",
            "(Update. Nothing has been fixed, plus search function is useless and, worse, there are posts from recruiting companies, a ton of them, that are regular positions NOT gigs, and fill up the feed. ) Meh. I have actually picked a couple of freelance jobs here, but not impressed with the interface. There is no way to tell how long ago a job was posted and they don't purge jobs that are years old. ( the only way to tell is to check how old the comments are) .",
            "This app user friendly and it's easy to do marketing service which you provide. Also support team very responsive by email. They are very productive and helping. I love this app",
            "This app does not provide real opportunities for work or jobs. if you ever want to find a real money-making job opportunity or gig, i advise you to explore other options. this app does not work."

Now I am in a dispute to get my money back that should never had been taken. They suck and I actually rate them negative 10 stars !",

Pay an annual fee for details (Host name, contact number, company website, specific address) 2. Call Hosts directly to see if they have any openings and to reserve a site 3. Arrive during business hours 4. Buy something from Host. It's a great marketing opportunity for Hosts. Note, your unit must be self-contained; Hosts do not provide any hookups."

For example, a topic like Division of Algebraic fractions was playing a video meant for Solving Simultaneous Equations:Substitution Method. It will be nice if this is fixed. I would let you guys know if there are any other challenges. You guys are doing a great job. Thanks...💛💞💝💕",
            "This app is so amazing and interesting. It makes learning more easier and faster. It is reliable, comprehensive and accurate. Thanks to those who brought up this idea and discovered the ulesson app. May God bless them. It will be better and highly appreciated if they can just add Further Mathematics as a subject, at least to help those having difficulty in the subject and for better rating and review from other students if you may ask me. But if not no problem, all the same Thanks.",
            "Very Good Educational app im very happy that i found it taught me a lot of things i needed to know but in proper detail and accuracy the animation makes even the most difficult concept easy to understand. Since this app is fairly new im sure other subjects will come in. Im having a problem with the Waec past question page it dosent load. I hope you fix it. Other than that Great app.",
            "One of the best educational app, it explains a lot of topics on all my favorite subject, was so excited and happy when I found an educational app, it is so much amusing to spend my time with this great and wonderful app then with any game that won't profit me anything, I am so happy to have this app in my phone, i give my heartfelt thanks to the creators of this app.",

We'll connect you with a licensed veterinarian 24/7. So why use Airvet? Ok, picture this:\r\n\r\nIt's Wednesday at 2:27pm. You are just about to hop onto your 6th Zoom meeting for the day, when you realize that you never put away that picked over rotisserie chicken after lunch, so it’s just sitting out on the kitchen counter. You walk over to the kitchen and notice… no chicken. No trace of a chicken. Instead, you see Buddy, your rambunctious 3 year old german shepherd, sitting quietly, nay... obediently... in the center of the kitchen. At first you think, was there ever a chicken? Then Buddy hiccups and you realize, Buddy ate that WHOLE CHICKEN, bones and all. You lose your mind! Can a dog eat a bone? Will Buddy die a slow torturous death? Should you drive to the emergency room right now? Is there even one around me? How much is this going to cost? What should your Slack away status be? Emergency Dog Death? How much would that cost? Then you remember Airvet. You open the app and in seconds you’re on a FaceTime call with Dr. Lantry, and all of sudden, you feel calm.

            "I only have the free version, and I don't frequently find the need to sort by paid category, as I usually do my own research and use this as a tool to help with specific products, not as a primary search platform. It is really helpful, but I wish it had less general explanations for some ingredients. I understand it is based off the listing from the manufacturer, but some of the ingredients are under an umbrella listing rather than specifically listed. Ex. Fragrance vs Essential Oils",
            "Don't bother with this if you live outside of the USA. I live in the UK & tried to use it repeatedly. It didn't recognise any of the products I tried to scan/ stated they weren't in the database (this included products from The Body Shop. Not exactly a niche, unheard of brand). When I tried to manually enter each product (a complete ball ache) the app repeatedly crashed. Talks a lot about the FDA/ how the EU regs are better, so I suspect it would work in the US.",
            "Good tool... Things to note though: To get all the perks, you'll need to buy the add-on (i didn't and still love it); Lots of products out there haven't been rated (but you can submit them); Some ingredient ratings are confusing (ex. natural fragrance has like 100 diff. names); Look out for reviews of products before buying (just because it's a '0' on the scale doesn't mean it's the best option out there😅).",
            "Been a great app. Lots of things have been rated but also lots haven't that I have submitted. I love that I can't find a better substitute to toxic options. I tell lots of people about this app",
            "Great resource - have been able to consistently change up products I was using to healthier alternatives - it's a challenge to get your bathroom shelf rating down, but worth it! Great app."

            "The app is one of the best apps out there but the update has not been great at all. It does not give you an option of the voice you really prefer to listen to. At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

Also sometimes bit sketchy with Emarld Checkout (sometimes fails to scan barcodes or complete the process).",

I like the ability to add and subtract areas if interest. They mark ads/sponsored posts pretty well. Pretty speedy on all devices, even somewhat older ones. Overall a nice news agragator.",
            "I've been using flipboard for years. Now like 80% of the content is videos. And NONE of those videos actually play. It's so weird. They have some new video set up, every time I click on a video, it doesn't play. Just black screen. Click on it, it goes to another black screen. So, two major problems rendering this app useless: 1. Nearly all news is now in the form of videos. I don't want videos. I want to read, and 2. Those videos don't even work. How do you not beta test this, Flipboard??",
            "If I open a page on source like golf or mma or something like that, I get articles that cover something else entirely. I'm really annoyed that I spend more time reporting articles that are not on topic and I don't know why this hasn't changed in years of reporting these articles... Please do something about this.",
            "Been using flipboard for quite some time since you can customize what news you see or just flip through all news. Biggest down side is tbe comment section is really subpar and broken up into different sections. Dont even bother commenting if you see 100 plus comments because your comment is lost at the bottom. Other than that is a nice app to see any news you want.",
            "Can't share URL if you click a link inside an article. Steps to repro: 1. Tap into an article 2. Tap any link on the page that goes to a different site 3. Observe the top toolbar shrinks from several items to 2 items. 4. Tap the share button in that toolbar 5. Pick literally anything on share sheet. 6. See \"Couldn't Share item\" error every time. If you fix this bug lmk and I'll revise my review! Update: Flipboard denied this obvious, reproducible bug. Smh. Bug does not happen on ios."

In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",
            "Just purchased an ebook. Money has been deducted from my account and the transaction is shown to be successful. Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "I liked this app so much when it first came out. There continues to be a bug where when you enter a wager on the app, it sometimes enters it twice. The scoring updates are very slow. Sometimes the notifications arrive, and other times they don't. Sometimes this app works perfectly, and other times, it won't load at all when switching between leagues. If this could be improved, I would likely renew my EDGE subscription, despite the very poor betting advice. I really like entering wagers on the computer in order to reference them on the phone. That works perfectly.",
            "If you just want to track your bets then this is 5 stars. Live game updates and alerts. The UI is buggy though so putting in your bets can take a little while unless your using a book that can be linked with them like Pointsbet. Also the promotional ads for sportsbooks sign ups are BS so don't bother falling for them. They got the commission and you don't get the crazy promo that you thought you were going to get",
            "Had a few bugs when first installed, but were manageable for the info the app was streamlining. However the new update killed the convenience this app used to give the user. If I could revert back to the old version, even with those few bugs I would 5 star it though. *EDIT* Changed to 5 stars due to lack of competition in the industry for a simple bet tracker. Even though it may bug up at times I am still much happier using this app, than any other app out there. Competition will change rating.",
            "On their app they had 59.99 annual membership fee which i paid. A month later I was charged 29.99. I immediately emailed them and was told at the time I signed up the MONTHLY was 59.99 a month and it was advertised as the annual which was a mistake. They had since dropped the monthly to 29.99. Bottom line is at the least they are engaging in false advertising. I would stay away from this app and would never recommend it to anyone.",
            "After the updates the app is horribly slow and lags. it takes forever to put in your bets. it use to be my favorite but not now im looking for another app. Painfully slow. And it wont stay on what sport you pick like i cant log my basketball or hockey bets. it will only will show baseball games even when i pick nba it shows nba at the top, but all the games are baseball. wth. Fix the app. its horrible."

Daycare 3. Space theme 4. Hospital 5. School i know these already exist but they would be cool to customize. 6. Pets to the customize list 7. Clothes to the customize list. 8. Masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to the list also. I know its a lot and it doesn't effect my game if they don't exist. I love your game! Bye!",

            "I would have given it five star but u can fix the bug that when we keep things in our house from somewhere else and when we reopen the game it goes back in it's original place and the full version of the game is very costly u can at least give the full game for free only for three days trail so that we can see the other places that how it is like and then buy it. But it's the best game for kids worth game.",
            "I absolutely love this game! However I think there is a bug now that they added the Halloween update. I have seen other reviews that say that the houses are total wrecks. Mine is the same. My houses I decorated have furniture just in a pile, and everything else is just purple. Purple walls, outside on the balcony is purple, the floors are purple, and I cant move anything. Please please fix this bug. I have spent a lot of birthday money on this.",
            "The game is overall good, but before I bought the misty cottage. I had an amazing world and I must have atleast spent 5 hours working on it in total. But as soon as I got the misty cottage, the game started glitching out. Early morning the next day I went on the game and my whole world reset. Now that got me upset. I wish to report this app and I want it to be reported and sorted out immediately. I have everything in the game and its around £70 for it all. Not funny at all. Sort it out please"

            "The game is great. My problem is that I had a glitch where I couldn't complete a game.I matched everything but no win. I sent a message and told them and mentioned that I lost 300 coins playing this game 3 times. They fixed it, but I guess they don't reimburse for their glitches. 2nd thing, now they have a survey going. 200 coins. I could use it. Takes 15 minutes. It finally says thanks you you now have the 200 coins. Well I didn't get it. Tried again. No coins. Asked for help twice. Nada",
            "Love this game, however since yesterday on every game I play, once I've cleared the board completely I have to use one of my help options to end the round. Not sure if this is a glitch or what. I hope this gets fixed, or I will need to stop playing and delete. I am updating my review, the previous has been fixed and now my game back to working as normal. I really appreciate the fast turnaround on this. Other than that, this game is fun, and relaxing... love it.",
            "It is fun, some stages more challenging than others. Sometimes items get stuck and you need to use a cheat to get them quick enough not to lose your bonus. Only thing is, there's a piggy bank that's full that you can't use for anything but you can unlock a bigger piggy bank but why??? There's no purpose to it??? I would love the ability to do a shared board with a friend.",
            "I like the game but like others I have issues: 1) ads which can't be muted. I don't care for the political ads, wish to mute. 2) Items on the sides being hard to grasp, agree. I started using a stylus. Easier. 3) I still have no idea what the coins are for as most things in the game cost money, not coins; I'm not sure why the amount of coins reset either, what's the point? I haven't reached the level some have mentioned where there are \"ghost\" pieces though. That'll likely change my rating.",
            "Originally I gave this game 5 stars. I have cancelled that because I now only get times in the 5 minute range. Gets very boring now. Same time continually. What happened? Also agree about too many adds. Not enough time given to actually playing the game. More time spent waiting for ads to go by. I never watch them. Fixed the 'same time' problem. Deleted game for a while. Then downloaded it again. Did this a couple of times until the times changed. OK for now anyway. Problem Ads the same."

You can also customize what kind of news hits your feed. Overall a very enjoyable app.",
            "The app so far is really good and works fine on my Pixel on Android 11. The crowd sourced headline and summary idea is very interesting. I don't feel qualified to contribute, but with more users that will get easier I'm sure. It's a very good way to get news. Even just reading the headlines is enjoyable. I don't feel like I'm being toyed with. The summaries so far have been very impressive for how they're made. You can tell a lot of thought went into them.",
            "Amazing app!! It's definitely the kind of \"one stop shop\" that people who like to pay attention to the news would find very helpful. It's got links to multiple news outlets and tells you their ideological tinge and location so that you can be pre-preparred for the tilt of the story. This is a great way to help people stay informed and be aware of any bias that they will be exposed to.",
            "Works pretty well so far. I wish you could see the bias of sources articles from different nations, instead of the flag just being the country or region itself.

I was told I would be credited for the second notary and then was asked to pay immediately after notary was compete. still don't know if my notarized doc was sent to transamerica.... update, support team fixed next day👍",

            "This app is the best ever if your like me. You love animals. Want them as pets and most importantly to me you actually save the animals life and do a little bit of good for these voiceless, helpless creatures who only want is for someone to love them! It has all sorts of filters you can use to locate the type, age, breed and it will tell you if they are already housebroken. Most of the time the animal will be sterilized, disease tested and even microchipped so if lost its easily recovered.",
            "Signed into this using my Google account, but when when I use that method on the actual website, the accounts are not the same, none of my favorites. No app option to login with email, just Google or Facebook. Very frustrating. No clear way to save fav searches in app, and there's nothing in the settings that let you confirm your email or any other info. Really poor usability. Feels like it's not trying to work with the site and is detrimentally bare bones.",
            "The app used to work great. Now almost every day when I go into the app it logs me out. It struggles to log me in and when I finally log in it doesn't have any of my favorited animals. It's very frustrating because I have to go back and favorite them. There's no point now because it's just going to log me out again and get rid of my favorites.",
            "Was working great on my Note 9 until the most recent update. Now, whenever I try to favorite or unfavorite a pet, it crashes. It also doesn't show that a pet you favorited is unavailable until you look at their details. I can't log in with my email either, like I can do on my computer, only Facebook or Google."

        "title": "CHAIR YOGA",
        "description": "Chair yoga is for those who might be struggling due to age, certain types of disabilities or inflexibility in general. It's also ideal for those that spend a lot of their time sitting down  and might be in need of some office yoga or are in crowded places wishing to reap the rewards from this exercise. \r\n\r\nThis is also an ideal type of yoga for seniors as its gentle and easily accessible for all. \r\nWhat's particularly great about this type of yoga is , it's simple , doable & all in the comfort of your own home , or in your office / work space. All you need is a chair and some spare time! Chair yoga is simply yoga but in a chair... you literally replace a yoga mat for that chair but continue to take the advantage of great fitness and better health that come's from doing some of these seated yoga poses. \r\n\r\nIt has also been known to help those with MD and CP feel not only physically healthy but also mentally fit and even happier!  Once someone, who hasn’t had the ability or chance to really work on their physical bodies are able to do so it does something for their mental health also. Stop and think about how wonderful you feel when you accomplish something you have wanted to do for awhile.

And what pictures they have are very simple and not linked to any of the poses discribed. For an app that is supposed to be for beginners to chair yoga --- don't you think we might need pictures or even video to help us understand the poses!!",

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Fantastic app for people who are interested in space and time or work with people in different countries around the world. Makes it easy to see the time around the world and if a place is in light or darkness. The imagery is high quality and nice to look at. Also includes useful widgets to quickly see the time around the world for coordinating meetings and calls. One suggestion, on the globe widget your location is centered for both latitude and longitude, if you live at a high latitude then only the northern hemisphere is visible. Would be nice if you could chose to center the latitude on the equator so the southern hemisphere would be visible.",
            "I expected that this was a World Clock app, but it only tells me local information. Time, Sunrise and Sunset. So only 4 Star rating ! This clock is also 10 minutes off from the actual time. For example... the Terra Time digital clock says 11:50pm... but the Analog clock will say 11:40pm. This needs to be fixed.",
            "well i like the app it does the job perfectly. The top dropdown is a little hidden... maybe a startup tutorial would be a good idea💡 im giving 5 star just because the replies of the dev to some of the comments were so honest and responsible.👍goodwork.",

            "This has to be one of the best looking world clocks I've seen! Ability to add multiple locations and check on their daylight status along with near real-time simulation of the earth too! On my wishlist is the ability to add locations via coordinates (I have a friend who works in a remote area and I'd love to be able to check his sunlight too) as well as an option to display all 3 stages of twilight on the clock as increasingly darker shades. With those two, this clock will rock my vote!",
            "Overall very pleased after day's use. One question. I want it to display the map as my wallpaper always centred on my location. Instead it scrolls around the world with my swiping on my home screens. Is there a way to shut off the scrolling? Keep up the good work!",
            "I love the app and use it for my live wallpaper... But a live view with real time satellite images it is not. I have the globe that as I swipe from home screen to home screen and it looks beautiful but there is a huge category 3 or 4 hurricane about to hit the gulf coast and what do you see on my phone... Just some random clouds throughout the gulf of Mexico not the huge storm churning in the Gulf... So there is a lie going on here...",
            "At last, multiple locations have been added. I bought polyclock many years ago & was disappointed that it was discontinued & no longer compatible with Android 10, it was by far the best world time app, now this is a great update and in many ways better than anything else available on Android. Many thanks.",

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

Spotify is much better than that but i hate it also because it only allows 6 song skips when you dont like the type of rock songs it provides. No clue why i searched best music providers and it answered with live x live other than they had a person who works for them say it",

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 🌟 is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

            "Function wise, it does the job. It's really just a wrapper for web pages. The formatting for my phone is too small. I have to zoom in to read anything. Also, many of the student pages have no back button on screen or even a link to \"home\". This is a huge problem because newer devices don't have physical back buttons. So my son has to get out of the app and load it back up. Imagine doing this 20 times a day. The formatting is an easy fix. I do appreciate that this system is available.",
            "I think they could improve the app. The videos glitch sometimes and go out of focus. They arn't that bad but it is kind of annoying. The autospellcheck is all messed up on the special assignments. I couldn't write an apostrophe after the name because it didn't recognise it. The classes are good, and I like the videos. You could get over the glitchy videos, but the special assignments are a pain. I would recommend it, but it is very frusturating for kids when they have a good artical but it gives you a bad grade because the app's spellcheck. I think anyone can deal with it, but I was exspecting a little more. I am trying to skip a grade over the summer, but I don't know if I could deal with it for a whole year.",
            "People need to read instructions and compatibilities before posting a bad review because they couldn't get the app to work 🙄. We've been using this program for almost two years and love it. The app works perfectly! I like that I can check on my children's progress any time and from anywhere. I've been homeschooling my children for 21 years, so I do know what I'm talking about.",
            "The app permissions makes it look like spyware... Acellus team could you please explain why you need to record us with our camera, connect to bluetooth devices, Record our microphones, Change audio settings, Have our precise location, Change our sound settings, View network connections, Use fingerprint tech, I can keep going.",
            "So far it's working well. It took a LONG time for me to get it loaded in the chromebook because I had to load it through the google playstore. I wish the parent log in was just as simple as th estudent log in. Otherwise it seems pretty easy to veiw and change everything that I want to."

            "Fun to play with. Plus you can have a list of the products that you have on emailed to you.",
            "I wouldn't purchase this if thats what it will look like. It didn't make up my face to a high standard and I thought it would recommend a shade of foundation which it didn't do. You need a better technology here.",
            "As a consultant I am devastated to say this ap should be discontinued. It doesn't do the product justice nor the many wonderful faces we serve. Colors not close some dont even show up. Storage can change colors drastically. Touch control slow. Beautiful eyelashes and instant pricing is great. The idea as a whole is fantastic . PLEASE PLEASE dear customers take a mere hour and meet with your consultant or at least ask for samples. I have a pixel android phone. Which is one of the best cameras."

When I contacted hostel World, they refused to refund the EXTRA money they had taken from my account for the second accidental booking, even though I said I wasn't cancelling and had just been double charged by accident. Would not recommend this app to anyone. Contact the hostel directly!",
            "I love using this app to find and compare hostel prices. I love that I can save paces I like and compare them before booking in the ease of one app. I also really like the feature where I can see all the countries and places I have stayed and the reviews always help when finding a place to stay.",
            "What a great app for discovering new places for my upcoming trips. Hostelworld apps always have me covered, the booking process is very simple with nice layout and interactions. Very cool being able to see where I've stayed as well on the map.",
            "this appis virtually useless if i can't log into my account everytime the sign-in-page comes the app starts loading whatever and doesn't stop i cannot even enter my password there shouldn't be much to load beforehand only the two fields for email and password plus the to buttons for sign in and cancel",
            "Brilliant app !! Nice layout, no fees, really easy to navigate and find cheap & good places to stay. I never use anything else when I'm travelling"

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened.

            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

            "Used to love this app. But lately more and more bugs seem to appear. For some weeks now we are unable to sync our devices. Always getting the response \"okay syncing devices for [names], sorry 3 things aren't available right now, you might want to try setting them up again.\" Trying setting them up again doesn't solve anything. Next up: We are quite invested in the Google ecosystem. But what I don't get is the nonexisting Android TV integration... How is this going to be solved?",
            "All of a sudden, I can't cast Spotify from my phone through Chromecast. Movie apps work fine, but suddenly I cannot play music, even though I have changed nothing in my settings and Spotify is set as the default player in Google Home. Settings are unintuitive and confusing, and each specific option is so difficult to find that it might take hours of exploring before you find what you're looking for. Please fix this as soon as possible.",
            "Frustrating! I loved my Google hub but decided to upgrade to a hub max. I ask it to do one thing and it does something else. The hand gesture does not work. Multiple problems with streaming. Max tells me I need to link my account even though I have done that. It asks me what I want to play my video on even though I have set the HubMax as my default display. I could keep going with problems that I have googled for help, gone to you tube for help, but can't get resolved. The app needs an upgrade!",
            "Not sure if this is Google \"home\" related or not. But in 2 weeks . 3 of my speakers died. One works if you stream to it. But does nothing else. 2 minis, now have all 4 lights dimmly lit and don't even register to add device. Since this new software update and other updates, things aren't working properly. Been trying to avoid Alexa for years. But at this rate a switch might be coming.",
            "The Google home app is Amazing! You can link cameras, Speakers, Thermostats and more! For example, I have a Google Nest Mini and a Nest Security Camera. I was able to link up both With No CONFUSION! You can also play and pause music on your speaker with just one tap of a Button! You can also take a look at the Security cameras! Keep it up Google! Brilliant App."

            "This has been pretty reliable for a long time, but the information just isn't keeping up. It's a shame really. With so many false review sites, CR is desperately needed. I look for digital thermometer and see reviews from 2016 and a top recommendation of a product released in 2004, according to Amazon. I know there are many things to review and rate but yikes. Covid-19 related products might need higher priority.",
            "It's probably a good app, I just didn't find it useful after installing it and finding out that the two reasons I needed the app weren't offered. Some things they don't review. Wish I'd have known that before trying it out. Edit: it's understandable as to why they can't report reviews based on the things I'm looking for. So I changed my rating cuz of this. Still a good app.",
            "Graphics are fine but the search engine is horrible. Fast food is a selection but only shows fast food breakfast? The search engine shows only luxury, small, and sports cars. You have to go to the categories for the complete picture there. Needs a lot of work.",
            "I do not have a permanent address. So actual magazines are not an option. If I get Amazon Prime I can get the electronic magazine but not the website; if I get the website I can't get the magazine, except through Amazon. Joseph Heller had situations in Catch 22 that coined the phrase. CR why don't you have all digital access? Why are you putting me in a \"Catch 22? Why is your website search so bad? Maybe your web designers are obsolete.",
            "The website is far superior to the app making it completely unnecessary. Plus what's up with the completely out-dated content? It's 2020 and while looking for top rated used cars all I could find was reviews for 2004-2008. :/"

Like say a boss fight every once a while and more part timer you have it's easier because they do damage to and say if you win you get 10% money boost every click. Remember this is just a suggestion. Feel free to actually do this.",

Your game does not need to know all this dev. You can use cloud saves and that is it. You do not need to know what my real name is and where I live.

I love having others to do conversations with but I it would be next level stuff to add that option. Also a private chat option to set up a time to go live and to cover our topic of discussion would be awesome as well. Apart from that, I love this app. Make those 2 pivots and I'll change my review to a 5 start instantly!",
            "LOVE it. If you are craving connection with others, whether you have mental health issues or are stuck inside for covid, this is for you! You can have a lot of really deep, informative conversations with others or just have a quick chat. The biggest improvement I would ask for is having more topics to choose, but I think this could be headed in the right direction.",

My network connection is wifi is fine. I see many Android users have this same issue. I enjoy this app and want to bring everyone I know to it, but not like this.",

You can see who will be working each day and in each department. Shifthound has many features and is very useful. Scheduling is simplified from a management perspective, too.",

            "Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from \"my day\". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!",
            "For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",
            "Redudant and limiting. There should be a way to share specific lists, but keep some private-a \"Honey-Do\"list; to be able to schedule minders for the 3rd level items and further break down tasks; to be able to reorder 3rd level sending completed to bottom; to be able to prioritize which list I want at the top and if I don't use Important, Planned, Tasks, then I want to move it down and pin what I want on top; to be able to set custom alarms, not notifications, for very important things...",
            "Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",
            "Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an \"assigned to me\" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."

I do not like to miss his radio teaching on KKLA radio each day at 15:00 hours (3:00 PM). A premier teacher with intricate but available knowledge of the word teachings. No one has provided me more in depth insight in years and possibly even ever! He not only introduces the explanation of the word but takes you to new places in the word. Places you may never even think you could know! Yet not only will you know these new perspectives but you will expand your faith no matter where you are in your walk. I have studied a bit but this is rare earth, as we used to say. Please I invite you to listen to Bishops teaching and see for yourself. I bet you never thought you could go there!!! I didn't but he takes me every time! I got BIG love for this man and his ability to communicate new and fresh vision to the word of God! Gosh, darn I didn't see that there before!"

The time to get this working properly is now, a lot of ppl looking to for an alternative to facebook.seems to be a lot of things not working yet. Even something as simple as loading a profile pic don’t seem to work yet. I hope you get this rolling soon, as I can foresee a lot of ppl signing up, hope you are prepared. I will give you more stars with updates.",

Your icon doesn't come up as one of the choices that I can share to, so I have to go about sharing in a round about way which is to copy the URL and paste. Today I find that I am not able to copy the URL and paste. I want to bring my friends here. I can see this as a real barrier. Please look into this. I do look forward to moving my Cubbies here. You have the most familiar interface to FB.",
            "I love this alternative to Facebook, but I'll get a notification and when I try to go see it and there's nothing there. There's a few glitches, but I'm anticipating this app being a contender to Facebook. I'm tired of Facebook having a monopoly on social media and I want this app to do well.",

I am tired of Facebook spying on me. They've block me from sending things in a private message if they don't agree with it. You need to get your Tech on this. Also another problem I don't have an option to share to USA life on web pages for sharing, there's no icon for it."

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

            "motivating, fun, exciting and immersive! I adore the detailed audio when incoming zombies or distant gunfire sound as if they're truly getting closer with your pace. \"Letters\" will also be e-mailed to you as you journey through this story. The free version is worthwhile for those looking to enjoy this a couple times a week, since it takes a few days to unlock each episode. Whereas subscription is worth it when you're looking to progress almost daily like myself. I love it!",
            "My favorite running app but... I like it for the entertainment. While the app is much less glitchy for legacy users than before, the distance is way off. I can walk slowly and it will say that I have done a mile every 6 minutes, when I have walked maybe half a mile or less. However, I do love the incentive to run when I have the Zombie chases on, it gets me going and has helped to make much progress.",
            "I love Zombies! Run!! I started running from zombies with the Abel gang in 2018, and never stopped. I only got 2 episodes into Season 1 before I started my subscription, and it has been worth every penny! This is the ONLY app that I cannot think of one single critical comment about. The stories are interesting, the actors are extremely talented, and if the need to find out \"what happened next\" doesn't get you moving, nothing will. Thank you, Six to Start!",
            "I just love this app, it got me running outside for the first time and made me want to go just to hear the next episode! The storyline is great, the app is easy to use and when the zombies chase you, you can't help but sprint 🤣🤣 Wonderful concept and so glad I found it! The other areas of the app like the 5/10/20km running plans are valuable and building up my base is a fun twist too. I recommend this app to everyone, its honestly the greatest motivator!",
            "So I have tried this on 3 different phones and had the same issue. Audio works for about 10 mins and then app goes silent. Have tried with / without music, internal and external player...no luck. As for not looking at app once started...need to remove that statement. Also, no headset start stop. No doubt the OS will be blamed, so uninstalled cause probably no resolve."

There are 2 bus lines on my way to work, one is exress another is local, 3 mins ago the estimate time is 3 mins for the local and 12 mins for the express, during all these 3mins, it's stays like this, but 3mins later it's 3mins for the local and 1 mins for the express. It probably is no big deal for the developer, but I missed the express bus.",
            "it works with 80% success of prediction to schedule... meaning, 80% of the time the bus will be there on the time its predicted (at least for my buses), so very well worth it. i dont think theres a better more comfortable app to use for this. so been using it for years.",

Otherwise it has been great, I'm really enjoying the app! Sub tasks should show their parent in \"Next 7 Days\" and \"Today\", this would be super powerful for splitting a task over several days, it would be a game changer for me!",
            "The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great. Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
            "Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days.",
            "I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
            "Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again !"

Relevant information to the way I trade can easily be found and setup, the app itself is fluid, trades are easy to input, and verifying you want a trade to go through is great. One glaring issue I have is updating the favorites list. Sometimes, the favorites list will not update the stocks I want to add. Other times, editing the favorites list doesn't work; the list will revert back to what it was despite attempts to verify the list was edited.",
            "Not able to even create an account. There is bug in the app which needs to be corrected. It is not going ahead after the birthday input in the account creation. I tried installing it after an year. Still the same.. no improvement.. disappointed...",
            "This app is 100% garbage. Trading values are rounded and thus inaccurate and that is if they even pull back data and let you trade at all. The FAQs tell you literally nothing. It will randomly reset your settings or not let your log in at all. I'll be cashing out, closing my account, and moving to Robinhood. There is a reason that one is so popular.",
            "Not really impressed with this app when compared to the dozens of other investing app. Dough doesn't have any instant funding while waiting for funds transfer. The transfer takes longer than other apps I have used. The interface is annoying and buggy with the app sometimes closing while I'm the middle of looking through stocks. This isn't friendly to investors wanting to make money. This is more like an entry level investment platform that someone with no knowledge of investing will benefit.2/5",

            "Highly unprofessional behaviour. I had booked from 4-5. The expert alotted calls up and say she is available after 5:30 or 6. She also said to cancel the booking and gave assurance that new expert would be alotted for the required slot. When I do that, the slots are shown booked. Why do they accept the requests if they are not available only. It was such a headache for me because I had to go somewhere in the evening and all other salons were fully booked for that day. Frst nd last experience.👎",
            "Used app for first time, horrible experience. Person didn't had understanding of work assigned. broke my new lock and make shift arrangements were done which broke within one month. on contacting housejoy, no help was provided.",
            "It is not giving an option of typing my address manually. The App detects my location correctly but the address that it generates based on my GPS is not correct.. It shows 3 houses far away house-no. I tried to edit the house-no with the floor-no but not able to do it as it is allowing to set my address only via GPS. Allow users to manually type their address as well because at times the manual entry is more accurate than GPS generated house address.",
            "Waste app.. While booking any serive they will show small amount and the techinican who visits your home will ask 4-5 times higher amount which is shown while booking... If you complain about that also there will not be any response from Housejoy.. For just saying there is a problem in AC stabiliser technician charged 900/- and after he lefts I got a message that the charges for the service is 143/- means he as taken 5 times high amount regarding which I have complained for more than 6 times."

            "Great game, its a good way to pass the time. Bit difficult to grasp what to do in the beginning but once you get the hang of it then its great fun. 30/10/2020 Um.... what happened guys? This last update you just did has made this game glitchy.... sometimes i cant log into the game and have to delete and re-install... so far its been done 3 times.... not cool at all. Fix the problem please. Thanks.",
            "The game has very good graphics and it could be a lot of fun to play if it didnt have players that harrassed and bully you constantly, I have only played for 1 week and I needed to quit, my group was constantly attacked everyday for 3 days by rich players. And were harrassed in there inboxes and made to feel uncomfortable. For no reason . Alot of people quit in my group , in the last couple days because of this. I will not waist my money on game, with players like this, I am uninstalling app.",
            "Stuck on loading screen since last update or would give 3-4 stars, but already getting bored anyway just another typical forced to join a group to play online and get attacked by other players and forced to spend real money or wait forever to advance once you get to a certain point type game. But at least they haven't forced ads on players yet like most do.",
            "Another update 2020 Oct 29. Game is a mess. Can't open app. Upon uninstall reinstall, app opens momentarily to find others saying app very buggy. App no longer works. Wow. Very fun UPDATE: Still a fun game. I have no problem spending a lot of money to have any chance of winning. Fine. What I DO have a problem with is that the players are \"bots.\" Support and devs are non-existent. Report a bug (which they have a button for) and get ZERO reply. Sucks. And no fixes. Total BS. Wake up dummies.",
            "Good graphics, nice game really enjoy it ..but the big issue with it is that when you opening it ,it loads for a few seconds and goes out completely and doesn't let you in ..and this happens after a while of playing ,after you've went out the game and want to go back in to play ...had to uninstall and reinstall to continue.... overall it's a nice game but the issue of not being able to go in the game after being out has to be fixed"

            "I use the app to keep track of how long the pumps have been running. It has a timer function, but it doesn't turn the pump off when the timer runs out (app developers, this would be a nice addition). The timer puts an alert up on your phone when time is up... if you're not looking at the phone, you don't see the alert when the timer goes off. It is nice to be able to use the app to discreetly pause/stop the pumps if necessary. The volume gauge is a rough estimate only. Not bad overall.",
            "Beautiful, but Useless. Look the idea is to help you keep track and analyze your milk supply. It keeps overriding the ounces I pump and now it decided to add pumped time for November 2020, and March 2021. It's Oct 2020... Rendering all previous data that may have been correct useless. It also has a timmer feature, but also useless since it just runs out, doesn't notify you and the pumps keep pumping. Everytime you try to delete a session you pretty much have to delete it 5 times.",
            "I have to forget and reconnect the pumps to the app every single time, otherwise it can't connect to them anymore at each pumping session.",
            "The app is functional but not great. It often fails to retrieve session details and sometimes can't connect to the pumps.",
            "In theory a good idea. Buggy and always disconnects from my pumps constantly"

Parents now have a certified record of all child / family expenses ensuring protection for all while eliminating the financial conflicts that may arise. With SupportPay, parents can now focus on what matters most, raising happy, healthy children.<br><br>NOTE: We are not associated with any state or government child support service or agency and we are not an enforcement agency. We provide an independent application for parents to manage child support and share expenses - directly with each other, eliminating the need for the government to be involved in your personal life. If you are looking for the status of your child support payment from the state then visit your state or county child support agency (DCSS) website. You will not find the status of your payment here. However, you can use SupportPay as an independent application to track your expenses and/or payments as well as a method to manage and share additional expenses such as medical, education and child care expenses - which the government does not manage.",

            "The customer support is super helpful & I love the expense tracking. It can be kept for court purposes too! It's helpful for when one of the parties says they didn't get the message or they didn't get the payment. Yes it is $80-$110 (they have a promotion right now) a year but its better then dealing with someone who thinks they are always right.",
            "This is a well thought out app. It can take some time to learn, but it can be learned. The document uploading is in my opinion the most useful features as yet. The customer support is knowledgeable, quick, and cares about the users and their problems. This app has impresses me. I don't usually write reviews, but a good app like this deserves one.",
            "This app has been super helpful in my situation. I regularly use the eCheck feautre and the Merhcant feature to create custom categories. I really like the layout of the dashboard and other sections as well. And the fact that it keeps track of data and documents, plus it can be used in court, adds to the accountability.",
            "I love this app! Many people complain, but I've used it for a year and a half with no problems. I got it because my ex is high conflict & it keeps the emotional abuse down. My opinion is that the negative reviews are from people who are rude to their ex, or are court ordered to use this. It makes our separation easier.",
            "I wasn't sure that this app would actually help my situation, but boy was I wrong! This is my favorite app. Anything you think co-parenting or separated parent will need, this has it. Document uploading, eCheck payments, custom categories. Thank you for having a wonderful, helpful product."

I got to the airport and had to buy new, separate tickets for every step of my journey. The refund section of the app does not work. The company have my money and have done nothing to refund me.",
            "App isn't working now, I think they've pulled the plug and ran away with all the refunds and fees collected.

            "Loved this. I am 42 years and down with severe back pain and a 10 kg overweight. So this app is just perfect for me as I have not yet reached the part where my body hardly moves or I can not sit on floor. But this is absolutely not for senior citizens, they won't be able to do most of these exercises specially those people, who never did it earlier regularly and need to find an app to start. My suggestion, change the target people. Show this app to light workout for beginners.",
            "Like it isn't timed so can go at own pace. Also like the repeated demo with a real person to ensure doing the exercise correctly. Lay out user friendly and right pace for seniors.",
            "Did the developer of this app test the exercises on those 50+, because many of the exercises can't be done by someone 50+ unless they are very fit to start off with.",
            "Not for all seniors. Can't get on the floor.",
            "I'm a senior lady and the last 2 exercises in particular are the hardest. I can't see many elderly and/or disabled people being able to do them. I'm disabled with chronic pain in my back, arms, shoulders and legs, in fact most of my body. I'll keep at it though, and edit my review in a week or so."

I don't do \"enable location\" and there are insufficient towns, no manual location input and particularly in the absence of a spatial search (art within 10, 20 miles etc) so you need to keep changing towns. It would help if exhibitions were shown as you pan around.",

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

If a few of the kinks were ironed out I would definitely give it a 5. It should be a little bit more intuitive as far as signing up a new user and locating the stats. I would definitely purchase books for this app. Any in French... Teachers in my jurisdiction are hungry!",

My 4 year old loves to go through the books and repeats them all the way through.  It's helped greatly in her interest in reading.  The security needs some beefing up.  Any elementary kid can get into the buying screen.  Also it would be nice if you could sync it to a google account or something.",
            "I love the idea but enabling the listen button each time is annoying for my son. Cant it just be at top right all the time? Sometimes the first word doesnt work until u press another word first. 1 letter words hard to activate. Maybe highlight each word when sentence is read?",
            "This is a handy, pleasant app overall.  Things to note:  - Booksy 50 (the book pack) is NOT the same as this app and they do NOT sync together. They are two separate apps. - If you purchase books in the free Booksy app, you must be careful when deleting or redownloading the app. Getting your paid books back can sometimes be a pain. - TipiTap was not responsive at their website, Facebook, through their email, or here when I had an issue. If you want to contact them, Twitter was the best/fastest resource.  Whoever was handling their Twitter account was on the ball."

The last time you gutpys updated two of my cameras stopped working on the app. but after two weeks or so they started working again. But now after the update on the 16th two of my cameras stopped working again. What's going on?",
            "Poor experience in fast forward condition first you need to buy package than you can allow to use fast forward and that also not that great which you paid for cloud package Please put fast forward specifications in SD card also because without this specification no use to find person as soon as possible..... Otherwise this app and product (camera) is to easy to use",
            "Im using network segment15(255.254.0.0) instead of 24,thats why even if we were in the same network with the same gateway, theres always a connecting issue. It would be better if this supports LAN storage as it is more secured and lower cost....I hope theres an update with facial recognition or maybe an update with 3D camera. Unstable playing over LAN when connected to wifi. Do you have a cam version with ethernet port capability? I think it would be better when playing livestream and replay....",
            "This camera works well. Very good clear picture, and has different ways the camera will connect. Alarm and voice works well. In the settings you can turn off voice, and disarm alarm, which are nice features. 4 stars because it needs an option for split screen view, at the top on right side by the X like most apps maybe in the future though . So far this is a good security camera with lighting as well.",
            "Application will not start at all after the update. Only white screen EDIT: I managed to start application by completely removing it and installing it again. Then I got notified to update camera firmware. I did. Camera said that update was finished and it seams that everything went fine (internet and power were stable). Now I cannot connect to camera at all. In application it says \"connecting\" forever on the panel where video should be shown."

I'm not even going to install the unit. Don't need the stress in my life. It's obvious you get what you pay for. These companies ruin hard earned reputations when they cut corners and put out a crappy product. Fire the designers, developers , engineers and boss.",
            "Glitchy. I have to uninstall and reinstall to log in. The reset link doesn't work. As for app function you have to hit test, wait, and hit test again. Connection issues occasionally. When you do have everything set up it works fine until you have to use again. We are moving and this is getting left behind.",
            "Had some issues setting up watering soak cycles and deleting presets, but received a prompt response from email support request with helpful details. App could be a bit more intuitive, but am satisfied with device and functioning now. Time will tell with how this goes, but considering low cost of device, it may turn out to be a good value.",
            "Terrible app. I've tried repeatedly to set up my controller with the app and repeatedly failed. Then, two days after I gave up, it acts like it worked but still won't connect. I reset it and the device connected and is solid blue, but the app still won't let me log in. Meaning I can't set it up to water. Can I just get a web interface? Your mobile developers ain't cutting it!",
            "Great idea, but terrible execution. If the controller is having wifi issues your plants won't be watered. Plus, the app doesn't notify you when it's having wifi issues. I've owned the controller and used the app for over 6 months, and while some issues have been fixed, there's a constant stream of new bugs. I'll gladly pay 4x the price for something that won't kill my plants."

If I use a rainbow ball in conjunction with another booster, regardless of what part of the level I'm at, the game freaks out and closes. When it does this, I have to redo the level again. If this continues, I will uninstall and reflect this in an update.",
            "I like this game because it is very relaxing. I also love the choices it gives you to work with. I personally love modern i think it is a cozy and cute inviorment to live in. I also love the matching game it gives you a way to get money. It is like a win win because you get to design and you get to match and overall i think this game is very good and that is why i gave it a five and if i had one complant it would be for a little bit more choices for the fashion sence. I will have my friends play",
            "Stupid & FULL OF ADS. Initially it was pretty good with not many ads. Now it's gotten so bad that there's not just 1 30+ second ad after every game, but 2 or even 3! It is beyond ridiculous how many ads you're forced to sit through in this game. On another note, it annoys me how the characters have been portrayed. The man looks strong and composed, hands folded across his chest. The woman, meanwhile, always has her mouth open, head bobbing, eyes squinting, looking like a silly child-like bimbo.",
            "I like this game because its direct. I mean other renovating games they ask us to earn stars to complete tasks. And those tasks include stupid ones like call a person, look under the bed, etc. But this only involves renovating and nothing else. No wasting time in listening to the people talking. I hate matching games but I'm putting up with it just because o this game is direct. I simply want a renovating game which doesn't have matching games, which doesn't have any stupid tasks and less talk",
            "I like this game because its quick. The graphics are good (not tiny little triangles squares and circles) Also you don't have to play loads of games to get furniture. The prices are pretty reasonable.so you get through rooms quicker"

            "Very good planner and travel companion, making good use of driving and public transport options as well as providing initial information on destination accommodation and sights. I haven't used the Premium version as I would only expect to use the app occasionally in my home country. However, a few years back I travelled from UK to Southern Italy and this app would have been a godsend for coordinating all the trip information in one place.",
            "I used this app since 2014, when it was tripomatic, to do my holiday sightseeing planning, it worked great. I even upgraded to premium. But now if I want to plan a trip I mostly find on the map \"ads\" to accommodations instead of places to visit with photos and visiting information. Disappointing.",
            "The planner seems to be more than fine. I gave 3 stars as I also have purchased the Sygic navigation and Travel has no integration with it. To navigate the trip I need to navigate to the next point each time. A nice addition to Travel should be exporting to the navigation whole trip with the intermediar points also. Update: this is not a bad review",
            "Ussd this for years. An essential app for every trip. You always find lots of unique things to see and do. The offline navigation with downloaded maps is amazing.",
            "I have used this app since 2013 when it was triptomatic. It continues to have more and more helpful features. I plan itineraries for a travel company by trade and love the ease in planning out my time when I get to play ashore."

            "A good game that my 4 year old boy really loves, ruined by the sheer volume of advertising. I don't normally write reviews. Yet felt compelled to let others know. It's all the time, every click another advert, he spends more time trying to get past adverts then playing the game. Greedy produces have ruined the gaming experience. Shame on you",
            "I had this game for iphone and loved it, id played thousands of levels after purchasing a no ads option. I just installed on android and apparently thats not an option on there. The ads are overwhelming, after every level and i will be deleting because of that, there at least needs to be a no ads option, i dont mind paying for a game, but the non-removable ads in this one definitely kill the fun vibe.",
            "There are ads after every one or two levels and the ads take longer to get through than it takes to play the actual game levels. Uninstalled after about ten minutes. Get rid of the ads and the game could potentially be amusing.",
            "It is not as the ads in other games make it seem and it has a ton of ads I can't even go 15 seconds without an ad showing up and interaptin my gameplay experience.",
            "This is totally awesome 👌 game 🎮 and the controls are very nice but the only problem is sometimes the game hangs while playing 😀 .After all this is great so, I prefer you to download it .You will like it."
