Created to be used with Virtual Reality (VR) glasses in order to experience and understand the way people with low vision see the world around themselves.\r\n\r\nLow vision is a lesser degree of visual impairment than blindness. It cannot be corrected with eyeglasses or surgery, and may cause people difficulties with normal daily activities. It is much more frequent than blindness, although much more unknown.\r\n\r\nMany partially sighted people show no abnormality in the appearance of the eye itself. It is also frequent that a person in some situations may show no difficulty, and in others they require assistance or the use of a white cane.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons, understanding how a person with low vision sees can be very difficult: due to a lack of awareness, because of the different visual defects, because it’s common to find several symptoms in one person, and because the percentage of vision loss may vary from one to the other. \r\n\r\nThis application intends to help understand how people with low vision see, to help them understand their difficulties, and teach them to interact with them properly.\r\n\r\nIt is a useful tool for different low vision specialists (ophthalmologists, optometrists, vision rehabilitation therapists, psychologists, educators), as well as for the affected people themselves and the organizations that represent them.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the aim of the app is to bring awareness about low vision in order to facilitate understanding and improve social interaction for persons with low vision.",

I tried the regular test with glasses on and had 100% vision in both eyes which tell me me my glasses are the right strength. Also the test to see if you have a stigmatism isn't right. It said I have a stigmatism in both eyes and my Son got the same result when he has 20/10 vision which is even better than 20/20 vision!"

Don't waste ur time by installing this app.",

Unlike the usual eye test charts and you can put in the distance you are able to see and hold the phone at this distance which is more realistic. I struggle to get them to look at the eye charts and they like screens though I don't like them using screens! Very useful tool though.",
            "it's great, except, once or twice the icon that indicates which eye to cover didn't switch, although the result was given as though it. had. further, i was expecting greater variety in font size, once I'd hit \"nothing\", a few times.... i cannot comment on acuity, at present. it's potentially useful, but for now, not yet worthy of storage space.",
            "I'm not sure ? I tried all of the images. Each one gave a different result. Mostly in my left eye. My right eye was also different but much closer to the same range. The instructions are simple. So I'm not sure what to rate it at. I'm going to try again using the same imagine each time.adding to my review, 2 weeks down the road. I've kept taking my eye exams . I stuck with the same symbols each time. I believe it to be more accurate this way. I'm giving 4 stars after truly trying it out!"

People often ask, \"what does red look like to you?\" It's impossible to answer, but with this app I can simply show them. NOTE: seems that with the recent Android 11 update on my Google Pixel 2 XL, I can no longer save images from this app to my phone. I get \"Image File Save Error.\" I have checked the apps permission and they are all enabled.",
            "An awesome way to illustrate my perspective to my friends. However, there is a weird bug where the shutter noise overrides the phone's volume setting and makes a loud annoying click. Only \"do not disturb\" silences it. Adding video conversion would be a cool feature addition.",

        "description": "This eye test is designed to monitor a person's central visual field in the most pleasant, intuitive and stress-free way for FREE.\r\n\r\nVision test is useful for:\r\n- Patients with macular degeneration (usually instructed to monitor their vision daily)\r\n- House visits\r\n- Household tests for adults who have doubts if a doctor's visit is required\r\n- Nursing homes\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Random test charts to eliminate boring and repeating experiences;\r\n- Voice controls to help you navigate easier;\r\n- Smooth and intuitive interface with animations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis eye examination is of particular interest to reveal age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which mostly affects adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment for adults over 50 years. Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to pass this test a couple of times each year no matter what your age is.\r\n\r\nThe amsler grid used in this examination is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula (e.g. macular degeneration, Epiretinal membrane), as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain. A particular problem is the age-related macular degeneration.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is made with the best of intentions. The intuitive and flawless design allows you to navigate easily through the application. The voice guidance is provided during the test so that you don't need to move your mobile device near or far to read the instructions but instead you can hear the nice voice guiding you through different steps and actions. The voice can easily be muted and unmuted.\r\n\r\nIn the test, you will be given a small dot in the center of the grid. One should identify if any of the straight lines are wavy, missing or have other disorder. At the end of the test results will show whether the person has problems in central visual field or not for each eye separately.\r\n\r\nMore details about central visual field, macular degeneration, retina, eye examination tests and trainings as well as other eye related topics can be found in our news.eyeexamtest.com blog.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is continuously under improvement so your feedback is appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\n- Take the most comfortable position to relax.\r\n- Have a mild nature light and no glare on the phone screen.\r\n- Wear your contacts or glasses if you normally do.\r\n- Place your phone approx. 50 cm/20 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Cover one eye at a time with your hand.\r\n- Stare at the dot in the center. Do not let your eye drift from the center dot.\r\n- Try to identify if any of the straight lines appear wavy or bent,\r\n- Any of the boxes differ in size or shape from the others, or\r\n- Any of the lines are missing, blurry or discolored.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Languages:\r\n\r\n- English\r\n- Russian\r\n\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO:\r\nWe highly recommend using our Eye Care Plus that allows to pass a more detailed eye examination as well as train your eye muscles for better vision.\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyeexamtest.eyecareplus\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nThis application is not intended to replace optician's regular full examination.

Why can you read this but do not see that ?\r\n\r\nOften that are questions when you meet a person with visual impairment but very often the answer is almost impossible to give. It is hard for one, who has no comparison, to describe what he is seeing and how it is different from what you see. \r\n\r\nWe developed iSee to raise awareness on vision impairments and hope to help for better understanding in what it means to have a sight limitation. \r\nISee is a simulator using the rear camera of your phone or tablet, displays the captured live image and adds one of the most common sight illnesses. The intensity of the sight loss can be regulated. It is possible to chose among Macular degeneration, Retinitis Pigments, Glaucoma or Cataract. \r\nBesides the simulation iSee includes to each illness information on treatments, causes and a description on its impact on the sight. \r\n\r\niSee was developed in cooperation with ophthalmologists. IRIFOR Macerata and the Italian Blind Union in Macerata is working close together with hundreds of persons with vision limitations and the experiences can be found in this application. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Advices and information provided by this app are for personal orientation and no medical advice. Each person experiences the disease differently. Please, when you experience any symptoms, contact a professional physician. \r\n\r\nIncluded Eye diseases:\r\n\r\n- Macular degeneration -\r\nMacular Degeneration usually occurs at people over 60. There are two types of macular degeneration: atrophic (\"dry\") and exudative (\"wet\"). As people age, parts of the retina may deteriorate.\r\nAlthough the cause of this condition is not clear, possible causes and risk factors may include: lack of certain vitamins and minerals, breakdown in circulation to the retina, untreated health conditions such as high blood pressure, excessive exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun, heredity, and smoking.\r\nThe eye care doctor can diagnose macular degeneration during a comprehensive eye examination. Ophthalmoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to view the back of the eye, including the macula. If macular degeneration is suspected, a fluorescein angiogram may be performed. In this procedure, dye is injected into the arm and travels to the eye. Damaged areas become highlighted to help determine which type of macular degeneration is present, wet or dry.\r\n\r\n- Retinitis Pigments -\r\nRetinitis pigmentosa is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the retina. RP causes the breakdown of photoreceptor cells and the patient experience progressive vision loss.\r\nThe first signs of retinitis pigmentosa in affected children are identifiable by a doctor as early as age 10. In most cases, the disorder is linked to a recessive gene, a gene that must be inherited from both parents in order to cause the disease. But dominant genes and genes on the X chromosome also have been linked to retinitis pigmentosa. In these cases, only one parent has passed the disease gene. In some cases, a new mutation causes the disease to occur.\r\n\r\n- Cataract -\r\nA cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye leading to a decrease in vision. They may affect one or both eyes and often develop slowly over time.\r\nCataracts are commonly appearing while aging. They may also occur due to trauma or radiation exposure. In some cases they also can be present from birth or occur following eye surgery. Risk factors are diabetes, smoking, extensive exposure to sunlight, and alcohol. \r\nEither clumps of protein or yellow-brown pigment may be deposited in the lens reducing the transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye.\r\n\r\n- Glaucoma -\r\nGlaucoma is the name of group of several diseases that damage the eye’s optic nerve and can result in vision loss and blindness. However, with early detection and treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.",

With this app you will have an own eye doctor for your eye care!\r\n\r\nLike any other muscles in our body, the eye muscles also need regular exercise in order to keep them healthy and strong. We all know that doing things like swimming, jogging or going to the gym keeps our bodies fit. But did you know that you can exercise the human eye as well? With an eye training or a simple vision therapy? Or with this eye app? \r\n\r\nWith this application you can discover how fast and easy it is to improve your vision and preserve your eye health by doing this 6-7 minutes eye training every day! You will also instantly feel your eyes refreshed after every training and it can also be effective before an eye test.\r\n\r\nEye Doctor (Eye Trainer) is a very user-friendly application. You only have to start the training by one click and the built-in voices will manage you through all the 12 steps so you can easily complete the eye training. Moreover there are figures indicating the correct method of doing every step! \r\n\r\nIt is also possible to pause the eye training for a while or jump to any other step you would like to do if you need to interrupt one of the exercises.\r\n\r\nIf you completed the training you can easily share it on Facebook!\r\n\r\nThis eye app can be used as a vision trainer or a vision therapy for eyesight recovery. You can achieve from slight to even serious results in your eyesight recovery with our vision training which contains carefully picked exercises (like moving your eye ball). This is your own eye doctor!\r\n\r\nThe training can also be useful reducing the symptoms of numerous eye disorders (eye problems) like myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism or eye straining. It is also useful if you do the training before an eye test (eye tester).   \r\n\r\nTips, warnings and further information about each steps are included in the Help. \r\n\r\nStart using Eye Trainer today! For improved vision and healthy eyes.  \r\n\r\nThe PRO version contains 9 full trainings like eye massages, a color blindness eye test or trainings reducing the symptoms of many eye disorders. Try it today!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Health is Wealth\" - and this is true for the eye protection or the eye care as well. The human eye needs frequent eye treatment, so it is recommended to do the vision training (or vision therapy) every day for suitable results at your vision improvement. Eye muscles should be trained often for winning your eyesight back (eye test). You will see, it will be like one of the eye games.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout our eye: \r\n\r\nEyes are organs that detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons. The simplest photoreceptors in conscious vision connect light to movement. In higher organisms the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals.\r\n\r\nVisual acuity, or resolving power, is \"the ability to distinguish fine detail\" and is the property of cone cells. It is often measured in cycles per degree (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles.\r\n\r\nAn eye handbook might help you for more info about the eye (or eye tracking).  \r\n\r\nPro version is like an eye magic app with 8 new trainings including dominant eye recognition and an eye color blindness test! An eye quiz with exciting eye illusions will be added later!\r\n\r\nc62bedc511",

            "Oh gosh!!! I passed both tests! I've really been wondering before about what it means to be a colorblind and if it really affects someone who's eyes are usually exposed to a cellphone's screen or that of a laptop as myself which made me think that I might have gotten affected somehow, but with this app I just confirmed that I'm perfectly clear from all those doubts!!! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!!!!",
            "My Father an Optometrist gave me a test like this in 1964. He said I was colorblind now my last day of my 68 th year. I find out that I am not completely colorblind. My brother took the test and he scored worse than me. Your app may be improved if you define \"line\" Wiggly is ok. Versus line as a straight line. 68 y",
            "Besides some spelling errors, it asks if you see a line and there obviously isn't one. But at the end it's like \" wrong, you should see a wiggly line here\". In geometry a line is defined as a STRAIGHT connection from point A to B. If you want me to look for a WIGGLY line you need to put that as an answer I can select. There is a distinct different between a line and a wiggly line.",
            "My all answers are not correct.But where I lost is because being skeptical about the name of colors or patterns.Else everything went well and quite complacent about it. One can fail the Colour blindness test just not because deficient in recognization of colour but also due to not sure about the name or correct information.So thats why one should have to be well equipped with the knowledge just before actually apperaring for the same in most concern places like jobs,etc.",
            "i took the test without and with color correction glasses and scored nearly normal with the glasses. (I have know i am colorblind for the past 65 years) the glasses make colors 'pop'. This test allows me to counsel my grandson and advise him that color blindness is who we are, it is different, not a defect."

            "Versatile and helpful, this app packs almost all the features that I need, plus several unfamiliar exercises which, nonetheless, are easy to do and quite effective. I am guilty of leaving it unused on my phone for a while, but now that I have started using it daily (max efficiency, 500XP mode), I feel like there's some improvement already in a week or so.",
            "To the developers, Nice app. Really helpful. Just a few things I'd like you to look into: 1. There is no pause button during workouts. And if BACK, HOME or lock by mistake, and then return, the 1 min timer gets restarted. Some workouts don't work properly altogether after this problem. 2. To activate any plan, we need to click on the SETTING button. However, the SETTING button of the DRY EYE PLAN is not working properly.",
            "Love the exercises. Unfortunately the Learn part doesnt seem to work properly. Visual acuity gets stuck displaying an object or letter (no questions or feedback) , Eye quiz and Accomodation say to swipe for next question but nothing happens when I do that. Kaleidoscope feature works. I remember these features working. I have a huawei p20 lite with android 9",
            "I wish the exercises reflected realistic daily routines. I wake at 5am normally, and 10a-3p is more late morning/afternoon. Broaden the time restrictions on the compiled exercises, please. I would be inclined to use the app way more.",
            "the exercises are nice and well put together. However, I can't judge their effectivness as the app \"reminders\" don't work, so I often forget to do the exercises on time. If it gets fixed, not only will I give it 5 stars, but will look into buying some of the plans."

            "It is very useful to work on. I was really in need of this type of visual acuity digital chart moreover, it has all the testing chart which is needed in refraction and eye examination.",
            "It wants your email address. There is a loud annoying ping every time you swipe to different screen. The chart defaults to logMAR, which is fine for me but might not suit everyone. No AMSLER grid or colour photos (not obvious to me). Very little thought has gone in to designing the app, an opportunity wasted. I think the positive reviews were probably posted by friends of the developer.",
            "**WARNING: SCAM** Unbelievably bad. Cumbersome, non-intuitive UI. The developer thinks YOU are complete moron who will pay $85 for basic graphics. If had a couple of hours spare I'd be able to throw together a product far better than this, and ld just make it free. The quality is surprisingly poor even for a free app, especially the Ishihara colour plates. I will keep looking fora $0.99 option - likely find a higher quality product. $85 for this?!? Gobsmacked.",
            "Great app. Really the only app that contains almost all the tests I need in my practice. And changing inbetween them is easy and smooth. Also, the remote control function is so helpful. The only problem I found is that it takes time to get the way to change and control the chart. You really need to add some instructions or help windows to show the users every test in included.",
            "I have been waiting for an Android VA chart app for years. Thank you for a great product. It worked beautifully at a recent charity mobile clinic I participate in, and I plan to utilize it frequently in the years to come. Great app!"

I tried to add my son, paid the 4.99 for the subscription then found out he needed separate account. I hope the membership on my account just adds another year. I added a membership to my son's account. It shows me in the history I purchased it but it still says expired in the app. I need to contact customer support when they open.",
            "Using Pvt to track progress of trying to reduce myopia. Seems consistent between measurements and with recent eye exams. It can't get enough confidence because my eyes will be up to 0.75 diopters better after a day outside. Overall pretty useful for experimentation.",
            "App works as advertised. Takes a couple of trial runs but then is easy. It took longer yhan i expected. Cannot wait to see of my new glassed correct my eyesight adewiately.",
            "Very interesting product. With Covid lockdown meaning I couldn't get my eyes tested, this seems to be a good solution. The measurement process takes a little bit of getting used to as you need to hold the phone still and put the eye cup in exactly the right place, but once you have the technique, it's really quick to do. Looking forward to ordering my first pair of glasses from the measurements I've made!",

            "So far so good. Just did my test yesterday and just waiting on my test pair of glasses with the vision number I got from the app. If they are accurate to my current prescription then will try an update this review with how that turned out. As for the happ itself, don't have any complaints. Everything went really well during my testing and the app was very helpful walking me through the whole process so never and to do any prep before testing.",
            "Website states can be used by wearers of bifocal lenses. It's true, IF you already know your add numbers. Customer service told me I can have that checked at the optometrist office. True also, IF I hadn't bought the product to skip a couple of trips to the office. Having half a prescription isn't any better than having no prescription. The app works good if you are a single vision wearer.",
            "At first it was very difficult but got much easier to use.",
            "The instructions were easy to understand (though aligning my eyes with the VisionCheck device PROPERLY took a little doing). But as they said, the tests got easier as you went along. EyqQue was most helpful in learning about my eyesight, and I would recommend it to anyone who has vision issues, or simply wants to check on their vision status.",
            "Surprisingly easy to use. The instructions from the pre test video and during the exam make it a very comprehensive tool. Once you've taken your inital test you can compare them to your previous runs. That being said at first you may encounter some trouble ( I have a really near sighted right eye) so I tried placing a bright object to focus on during the exam to get my eyes to properly focus, once this is done, the exam is a breeze and you can identify the lines no problem. Highly recommend."

My mobile device security app warned me this was a low reputation app (their words not mine) as it may take pictures at any time and may run in the background unbeknownst. Uninstalling. Finally, the launches a browser to a glasses website after measurements estimated.",
            "Honestly, it's pretty accurate! Tried finding out my glasses prescription and it's the same as what the optometrist gave me. The PD result varied but was only off by about 0.5mm. Useful if you lose your prescription but only vaguely remember what it is, or only remember part of it.",
            "Easy to use. Like the voice guided instructions. I did it three times and got the same result. I did it by hand first and the results are 2mm apart. I trust the accuracy of the app. Thanks for offering this service for free.",
            "Very disappointing. I compared the PD measured by the Optometrist and my wife, it was off by 3-4mm. I bought the premium version ($7.99 wasted) to get the PD off my glasses (it doesn't). The RX was completely off too: Actual (OD -1.75 sph, +0.75 cyl, 100 axis; OS -1.50 sph, +0.50 cyl, 98 axis). Result (OD -1.00 sph, -0.75 cyl, 5 axis; OS -1.00 sph, -0.50 cyl, 5 axis). PD actual 57.5mm, results of 60, 61.5mm. Don't rely on this for obtaining your current prescription because it can't."

It allows practitioners to grade patients against 16 sets of images and covers the key anterior ocular complications of contact lens wear. The conditions are illustrated in five stages of increasing severity from 0–4, with traffic light colour banding from green (normal) to red (severe), providing a straightforward and efficient aid for the optical professional.\r\n\r\nAvailable in 17 languages, OptiExpert™ enables practitioners to control what is shown to the patient so they only see the conditions and severity that is relevant to them. A visual representation of their condition also helps patients understand the importance of their ECP’s recommendations, such as upgrading to a silicone hydrogel contact lens to improve clinical signs of hypoxia or the importance of adhering to contact lens wearing schedules.\r\n\r\nAdditional benefits of the app include the ability to securely store images of the patient’s eye condition - facilitating easy comparison to other images on the scale to aid accurate grading. Practitioners are able to add their own comments following each patient evaluation, allowing a comprehensive record to be compiled of each individual’s condition and any treatment prescribed.\r\n\r\nOptiExpert™ is an educational tool.

Now I have to keep turning it back on again and again. I need this to work correctly for me. I do alot of political campaign work and train via teleconferences on many late nights. What is happening or causing Blue Light Filter to behave this way?",
            "I think that his app is great!OK I'm not a pro..I hope it works(I think they do research&stuff,pple must test BEFORE showing it to us!)THE COOL THING IS:on some TV shows apps,the image is still SOO NICE,that I don't see a huge difference,4 the TV show!(/movie,if U prefer movies before going to sleep. But I think it depends on the channel/app,cause some change a lot,some DON'T(still very nice)How great is that!I tried few apps w/blue light filter before,but it always changed the TV(in a BAD WAY!)",

            "I've had this app on my phone a year now and enjoy using it very much. I find the exercises quite useful and relaxing as I'm on the computer roughly 12-to-16 hours daily at home. It has reduced eye fatigue and improved my vision significantly. A very useful tool with adjustable schedule and exercises for multiple daily use. I highly recommend it.",
            "Very useful! I'm someone who's been to a few eye doctors and this feels right.",
            "When I relax myself and read the instructions and then do it. My eyes fell refreshed. This may not work for everyone. But I noticed that while looking at my devices I very seldom blink my eyes or move my eyes around, I just steady stare. But this APP needs to give me an option choice, if I want a pop-up to remind me to exercise my eyes. And then let me automatically return to what I was doing.",
            "Even though some comments says that we can't read what is written while you're exercisesing it vibrates I tried it the first time and I love. 5 star💗💗 I feel refreshed every time I use this application"

I could even see faces in cars, except those with dark tinted windowscreens. I couldn't see the 3D image in the app. Maybe one day I will.",

Unfortunately, it seems to no longer work and constantly crash, I hope the issue gets resolved quickly.",

            "I like that this can let you schedule when it works but I don't like the fact it colors your screen. I have Screen Filter to turn my brightness down past what Samsung allows, that app DARKENS your screen, that's it. Simple. I LOVE IT! The only reason I needed to switch is that that app is so simple, I can't schedule when it runs. I CAN do that with this one but with so many it these, it makes your screen RED even when set to \"daylight\" it's still colored a little and I just want dark, not color.",

I'm hoping to redownload it later but until that glitch is fixed I can't even have the app on my phone."

            "This is by far the worst eBook app I've used. If I switch to a browser to look up more information about something, it crashes when I switch back maybe 80% of the time and it loses track of where I was, so I have to scroll down and hope that I recognize where I was. I can't change the brightness of the screen while using this app. It always cranks up the brightness to full, so I'm blinded if I try to read in bed at night. I've reported crashes probably 20 times, but nothing gets fixed. The last update to this app changed the logo...great work guys. Its not like these books are inexpensive. Please fix your app.",
            "I have so many issues with this app that I won't remember everything. First of all, the app never remembers what page I'm on. Extremely frustrating to have to navigate through the table of contents each time just to find the chapter I'm on. Second, why is the default view images? When you open the app, it should go to a page of text, not a list of images in that chapter. Third, the app crashes immediately on my tablet unless the page format is set to horizontal scrolling. Also can't highlight."

The instructions are clear, and straight forward to follow and the test is easy to take/administer. My only gripe is that, it would be good if one can administer tests  continuously to different individuals one after another without the need to remove the phone from front of the EyeQue Insight device:  move the big red Done button to the bottom, make the pupil distance selection function use only the bottom part of the phone screen. These app improvements would greatly help the utility of the device for VA measurement."

        "description": "Take care of your eyes!\r\n\r\nThe application will allow you to form healthy habits for your eyes.\r\n\r\n⚠️ EYES PROTECTIONS\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigation by the famous British oculist, the number of people suffering from myopia has increased by 36% compared with 1997, when there were no smartphones, and mobile phones began to come into use. If the progression continues, then by 2035 more than half of the people around the world (55%) will have poor eyesight.\r\n\r\nSmartphones and tablets cause much more harm to eyesight than computers. Of course, the reason lies in the diagonal of the screen. To see what is written on the tiny display of a smartphone, you have to bring the device too close to the eye, and this negatively affects the concentration of vision and contributes to the destruction of the macula, the eye area that allows a person to distinguish small details.\r\n\r\nThe main thing to take care of is the distance from the smartphone to the eyes. The smartphone screen must be placed 30 cm from the face.\r\n\r\n★ HOW DOES IT WORK?\r\n\r\nThe application checks the distance from the phone screen to your face. If the distance from the screen to the face is closer than you configured, the phone screen will lock and ask you to remove the screen farther. After you fulfill the request, the screen is unlocked.\r\n\r\nThe triggering distance depends on the model and camera characteristics of your device, but you can adjust the triggering distance for eye protection yourself. Launch any application and bring the phone close to your eyes. Wait up when the protection triggers and evaluate the distance. If it is insufficient or exceeds the norm, adjusts the sensitivity in the application settings.\r\n\r\n⚠️ EYE PROTECTION AGAINST THE BLUE LIGHT OF THE PHONE SCREEN\r\n\r\nBlue light - a part of visible light with a wavelength of 380–780 nm, directly affects the biological rhythms of a person, the cycles of vigor and sleep. Phone screens emit blue light and its excessive exposure is especially dangerous for the eyes, causing symptoms of digital visual fatigue, eye damage, and behavioral disturbances. As noted in the report (Harvard health publications), blue light may even be associated with the development of certain types of cancer (possibly as a result of a decrease in melatonin levels).\r\n\r\n★ HOW DOES IT WORK?\r\n\r\nThe night mode filter changes the blue radiation (harmful to your sleep) of the screen to warmer tones. The principle of operation is based on overlaying filter overall windows. A color temperature below 3500K will improve sleep quality and allow you to read at night in comfort, which can have a beneficial effect on sleep quality.\r\n\r\n⚠️ Application features\r\n\r\n• Eyes Protection - helps you keep your device at the correct distance from your eyes, which helps you create healthy habits for your eyes.\r\n• Pre-installed blue light filters - use one of the pre-installed filters to reduce the effect of blue light on your eyes.\r\n• Automatically turn on filters - set a timer to automatically turn on the blue light filter at night.\r\n• Filter intensity - allows you to adjust the intensity of the glow of the device screen.\r\n• Reduced power consumption - allows you to reduce battery consumption on most devices, by reducing the intensity of the glow of the device screen (relevant for AMOLED screens).\r\n\r\nCheck out the subscription price: https://eyespro.net\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\nIf you have any issues or questions, you can always contact our support team: support@eyespro.net\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\nDrawing on top of other applications - required to apply a blue light filter.",

            "It's a really good simple App, issue is personally my eyes are still strained. I have this App plus the blue light filter on my phone settings on. Fo two weeks now. My eyes iched still to the point where now my right eye is swollen lol but ja, nice App. Just not strong enough for me cause I use my phone way too much at night in the dark reading and watching YouTube. Not an App targeting this kind of aggressive phone user but if you won't use your phone much at night then sure get this App.",
            "Fantastic addition to my Android phone. Diminishes blue light and gives peace of mind that eye strain is being limited. Does dull screen brightness but the relief of headaches and tired eyes is worth it. Though it's set to automatically start after reboot, it still doesn't and I have to remember to manually start it every time. That's the only little disadvantage. Highly recommend Iris mini!",
            "Great. Miravision Bluelight defender at Blackview is too weak; and Eye Protection in Android 7 is totally useless (no difference between switched on/off). But Iris is great. As well as PC Win version. It maybe could have settings, the same as Iris micro for PC, but it is setted/calibrated well in the fixed settings. It is app which I was waiting for for long time.",
            "Good somewhat, doesn't crash, but lacking customization which really destroys this app for me. On Android 10 it doesn't filter on top consistently leading to some rather harsh blue light exposure when using the task bar or any overlays. The app itself has one setting, on/off OR, show notification. That's it. It's dumb simple but twighlight beats it by a mile, or ten.",
            "Holy poop. I stare at a monitor, phone or tv screen like 14 hrs a day. My eyes ache all the time at varying degrees. I install this app and I dont feel my eyes any more. Awesome app. 10 stars. Life changer. One suggestion. When screenshoting, make it so it screenshots under the overlay if its possible."

Im starting to see what i assume is whats referred to as 3D vision, its quite bizarre and hard to explain to someone who isnt amblyopic.

The increase in cases of myopia in children in recent years is alarming and MYOPIA is even being referred to as the epidemic of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nOne way of preventing the appearance of myopia in children is Eyesapp which follows the recommendations of experts in terms of time, distance and visual exercices, complying with rule 20-20-20. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\n1 - Install the app.\r\n2 - Create a parental profile by simply entering your email and password.\r\n3 - Create as many user profiles as needed.\r\n4 - Set the session time and let Eyesapp protect your family's eyes.\r\n5 - Eyesapp works in the background, continuously controlling the distance between the eyes and the screen, it will interrupt the activity when it is less than 30 cm until the safety distance is recovered.  \r\n6 - Every 20 minutes our fun robot will activate a rest period with the aim of resting your eyes. During this period, the user will have to take their eyes off the screen, perform blinking exercises to moisten the eye and focus on lenses at a distance of approximately 6m (20 feet) to relax their vision.\r\n\r\nEyesapp functions : \r\n\r\n- Control of the distance between the user's eyes and the screen.\r\n- Controls usage time and recommended rest periods to avoid visual stress and digital eyestrain.\r\n- Records the evolution of the use of the device.\r\n- Create unlimited profiles for each family member. \r\n- Provides usage data both in distance and time for each profile. \r\n- Visual exercises for children that help prevent myopia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYOPIA AND SCREENS\r\n\r\nMobile devices (mobile and tablet) are becoming a key element in everyone's life.

Otherwise often the exercises are skipped for later with a thought of just having started using the phone.",
            "Good idea, but limited options. Short breaks are spaced max 30 mins. I only want a short break once an hour. Long break is max at 80 mins. I want a long break every 3 hours. I'd be happy to pay the $2.69 for premium if it had the features i needed. Uninstalling and I'll keep looking.",
            "Overall good but I dont want this to appear when screen is locked. There is no point in doing that. It should only show up when Im using the phone. Also Im ok with banner ads but video ads is just too much hence im uninstalling. Thanks.",

I think who ever made this app, the biggest cheater. Nothing is telling me. It's don't remind or helpful. Please don't purchase by buying. It does nothing wrost app."

One reqyest: Can you make the FOCUS training type have a level where the lines are thinner (like in MULTI II), on a white background, and moving to the smallest possible size? The moving farther and shorter is relaxing, but it can additionally challenge the eyes if the lines are thinner. Thank you! *I cant read korean*",

Changed review to 2 star.",

Whenever i want to unlock my phone, i see no filter light applied on the lock screen it's always the same as before.... i shall only rate the app to five stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟only when the above problems are solved.",

            "1.In the previous version the notification was directly a full-screen popup,but now a small popup notification showing skip and show appears.This is of no use, we can't press the \"show\" button each and every time, we NEED a DIRECT FULL SCREEN POPUP notification after the timer period. atleast give both the options for user to choose. 2. Check out BREAK TIMER APP for windows u will get lot of ideas to customise this app. PS: I am using asus zenfone max pro m2 mobile with stock Android 9 version",

I looked into the 20-20-20 rule and found this app (its competitor didn't seem appealing) and the pain has since subsided. Dropping my screen periodically to stare out of my window is also pleasantly meditative. I've set a 40sec eye break every 35mins. I'd add 1 more star if the app didn't buzz when my screen is off.

Постоянная работа с компьютером, неправильное освещение на рабочем месте или даже привычка читать лежа приводят к переутомлению глаз и нарушению в работе глазных мышц.

Так зачем доводить до очков и контактных линз, когда можно вовремя принять необходимые меры? Выход прост: загрузите бесплатное приложение iКулист, которое позволит вам быстро, легко и в удобное для вас время проводить диагностику своего зрения с помощью общепризнанных тестов. Все они имеют детский режим. Это особенно важно, так как маленькие дети попросту могут не понимать, что с их зрением что-то не в порядке. И если не выявить это на ранней стадии, ухудшение зрения скажется на всей их последующей жизни.\r\nНачать работу очень просто. Запустите приложение, расположив устройство на расстоянии вытянутой руки. Следуйте указаниям программы. В конце, согласно результатов ваших ответов, iКулист выдаст свое заключение. Если состояние вашего зрения хуже нормы, обратитесь к профильному специалисту.\r\nРазумеется, стоит понимать, что сама программа - всего лишь инструмент, позволяющий отслеживать изменение в состоянии вашего зрения. Точность результатов может зависеть от многих факторов, в том числе, и от вашего оборудования. Поэтому iКулист никогда не заменит живого врача.

It can be hereditary, but may also occur because of eye, nerve or brain damage or due to exposure of certain chemicals. But we can usually come across with myopia and hyperopia caused by exhaustion, reading or working from wrong distance, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Duochrome Test is made with the best of intentions. The intuitive and flawless design allows you to navigate easily through the application. The voice guidance is provided during the test so that you don't need to move your mobile device near or far to read the instructions but instead you can hear the nice voice guiding you through different steps and actions. The voice can easily be muted and unmuted.\r\n\r\nFor each test you will be given a letter on two different colors to identify on which color you see the letters more clear or blurry. The randomly picked test charts will make sure you don't have a chance to memorize the provided numbers as well as answer positions so easily if possible at all. This important feature will make sure you are never bored passing this test. Also when used in offices or universities the persons passing this test will never be able to fill correct answers just because they have good memorization skills.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the test results will show whether the person has myopia or hyperopia or not for each eye separately.\r\n\r\nMore details about shortsightedness and long sightedness, eye examination tests and trainings as well as other eye related topics can be found in our news.eyeexamtest.com blog.\r\n\r\nThe Duochrome Test is continuously under improvement so your feedback is appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\n- Take the most comfortable position to relax.\r\n- Have a mild nature light and no glare on the phone screen.\r\n- Wear your contacts or glasses if you normally do.\r\n- Place your phone approx. 50 cm/20 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Try to identify on which color you see the letters more clear or blurry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Languages:\r\n\r\n- English\r\n- Russian\r\n\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO:\r\n\r\nWe highly recommend using our Eye Care Plus that allows to pass a more detailed eye examination as well as train your eye muscles for better vision.\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyeexamtest.eyecareplus\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\n\r\nThis application is not intended to replace optician's regular full examination.

I know with my iPhone, I was able to screenshot without the iPhone's default filter affecting the screenshot. Can you please rectify if possible? 3) Also, an ad keeps coming up every few clicks while I'm in the app. Can you please fix this?"

In fact it has got much worse gradually over time, it now happens more frequently. When it shuts down my phones standard brightness settings reactivate which is far too bright for me.

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",

        "description": "Using phones or tablet for a long time leads to eye strain and affect your sleep, Screen Filter is a free app used to reduce blue light by adjusting the screen to natural color. Shifting your screen to night mode can relieve your eyes strain, and your eyes will feel at ease during night reading. Also, Screen Filter will protect your eyes and help you sleep easily.\r\n\r\nScreen Filter is good for reading at night, gaming or any long time usage\r\n\r\n⭐️ Features:\r\n\r\n🔸 Easy to use, just one tap\r\n\r\n🔸 20 Filter color to select the most comfort for your eyes \r\n\r\n🔸 Brightness bar to adjust the filtering level from 0% - 100%\r\n\r\n🔸 Notification to quickly enable or disable the filter\r\n\r\n🔸 Widget on the home screen\r\n\r\n🔸 Small size\r\n\r\n🔸 Save battery life\r\n\r\n🔸 Support phones and tablets\r\n\r\n🔸 Support 15 languages\r\n\r\n🔸 No creepy permissions\r\n\r\n⭐️ Permissions:\r\n \r\n⚫ Draw over other apps\r\n\r\n⚫ Internet: used by Google AdMob\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n🔴 In first use please make sure to set device brightness to 15% at least, then enable the filter and set your settings.\r\n\r\n🔴 Please turn off the filter before installing other apps or taking screenshots.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore tips to protect your eyes:\r\n1️⃣ Limit screen time when you are not working. It is impossible to avoid digital devices in the workplace, but you can reduce the amount of time you spend on electronics when you are not working. Digital devices often provide a passive “escape” from reality that seems enjoyable, but it can be a poor use of your time and can just increase eye fatigue and muscle strain.\r\n\r\n2️⃣ If you use your devices at night, download a blue light filter app. There are several free apps in your App Store that will put a filter on the screen of your smartphone or tablet to reduce glare at night. This will help reduce eye fatigue.\r\n\r\n3️⃣ Try not to use your devices directly before bedtime. Overexposure to blue light can cause restlessness and insomnia. Set a limit of turning off your devices at least one hour before bedtime and charge your devices in a different room so you are not tempted to turn them back on.\r\n\r\n4️⃣ Blink, blink, blink. One reason that we are more susceptible to dry eye when using electronics is that our blink rate is reduced significantly.  Put a post-it note on your computer screen that says “Blink”! Blinking more often will keep your eyes moist and refreshed.\r\n\r\n5️⃣ Get regular comprehensive eye exams. There is no substitute for an eye exam by a licensed specialist. Schedule regular eye exams to ensure your vision stays clear and healthy. You can also talk to your ophthalmologist about prescribing protective lenses with blue light filters to reduce eye strain.\r\n\r\n(Source: https://yoursightmatters.com/tips-reduce-hazard-blue-light/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy:\r\nhttps://ehlbdev.com/PrivacyPolicies/apps/ScreenFilter.html\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Us:\r\n◼️ Visit: http://ehlbdev.com\r\n\r\n◼️ Contact Us: ehlb.dev@gmail.com\r\n\r\n◼️ Check out our other apps: https://bit.ly/2AN9fQK\r\n\r\nThank you for using Screen Filter 😊",

        "description": "￭ App Description \r\nThis app uses stereograms to help improve eyesight.\r\n\r\nThere are two functions that affect eyesight—eye muscle function and brain function.\r\nEye muscle function controls what we generally call eyesight, and it is the ability of our eyes to focus on what we see. The brain function that affects eyesight is the ability of our brain to recognize and visualize what we see physically. In order to improve eyesight, you need to not only strengthen the eye muscles, but also increase the ability of your brain to perceive visual images.\r\n\r\nIn 3D Eyesight Recovery, by looking at a 3D stereogram, \r\n- you can strengthen brain functions by focusing the eyes on a 3D image, \r\n- at the same time you can use eye muscles that you normally do not use,\r\n- and by switching from the walleyed method to the cross-eyed method, to opposite ways of seeing, you exercise the eyes.\r\n- Additionally, the stereograms make it fun to continue exercising the eyes.\r\n\r\nIn other words, using the app in this way will give you the four benefits above at the same time. You will have fun while providing your eyes with good exercise.\r\n\r\n￭ Instructions for Use\r\nLook at the stereogram using the walleyed method and the cross-eyed method, one after the other. Use this app regularly on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n￭ Walleyed Method (diverge) \r\nInstead of looking at the picture, focus on a point further ahead of the picture. If you continue to look far ahead, the two eyes you see in the upper part of the picture will look like four eyes, and then the two eyes on the inside will start to move closer together until they become one. If you move your line of vision to the picture, the flat picture will look three-dimensional. If this is your first time using a 3D stereogram, you may be surprised when this happens. It will be difficult at first, but once you get used to it, it will be easier, so do not give up.\r\n￭ Cross-eyed Method (converge) \r\nIn this method, you look at the left side of the picture with your right eye and the right side with your left eye. Unlike the walleyed method, you adjust the focus to a point closer to you than the picture. Place a finger between your eyes and the picture and look at your finger. The picture is behind the finger so your eyes will naturally see the opposite side of the picture, so maintain that line of vision and remove your finger. It requires some practice, but as you gradually adjust your focus, the picture will begin to appear three-dimensional.\r\n\r\nLooking at 3D stereograms is exercise, so your eyes will get tired. Please refrain from using this app for extended periods of time so as not to tire your eyes.",

Moreover, memory usage is also low.\r\n\r\nWhat is BLUE LIGHT & How does it harmful?\r\n\r\nSmartphone screens emit bright Blue Light so you can see them even at the sunniest times of day.\r\nBut at night, your brain gets confused by that light, as it mimics the brightness of the sun.Using smartphone in night cause inability to fall asleep\r\n\r\nBlue light belongs to high color temperature, it’s very short and visible wavelength between 380-550 nm for circadian regulation.\r\n\r\nHow does blue light damage the eyes?\r\n\r\nExposure to blue light inhibits the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influence circadian rhythms and cause inability to fall asleep.\r\nScientific studies shows that blue light imposes serious threats to retinal neurones and causes age-related macular degeneration(AMD)\r\n\r\nIn night Blue light causes the brain to stop producing melatonin, a hormone that gives your body the \"time to sleep\" cues. Because of this, smartphone light can disrupt your sleep cycle, making it harder to fall and stay asleep - and potentially causing serious health problems along the way.\r\n\r\nThe Melanopsin photoreceptor in your eyes is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light (460-480nm) which suppresses Melatonin production - an important hormone responsible for healthy sleep & wake cycles and body regeneration.\r\n   \r\nBlue light filter is used to reduce blue light by adjusting the screen to natural color. Shift your screen to night mode can relieve your eyes strain, and your eyes will feel ease during night reading.

            "I've tried many OCR apps (image to text converter) and none of them came close to what this app produces. Although it is still not perfect yet (which is mainly because of infinite handwriting styles), at least it doesn't produce gibberish like the other apps. I hope the algorithm keeps improving and it would be great if you could add speech for other language texts too.",
            "Have been looking for an app to transcribe my handwritten notes to editable text for a while. Just downloaded this app after reading a positive review. The said OCR is by no means perfect, but then neither is my handwriting and so far I am actually pretty impressed. I like to save an image of the page to OneNote and then copy the transcribed text next to it. Would be great if I could setup a macro to do both in one go.",

Ads are annoying but never that bad, and the very empirical way the text is transcribed is much appreciated. 5 stars for functionality, overall 4.7 because ads",
            "Top of the line, excellent for small receipts and business cards. Good for books but you might need two or three takes per page. I couldn't test it properly for handwriting during the very limited trial time allowed. Overall the development of this APP is marvelous, excellent work!",
            "This app has been a very useful tool. I'm so grateful for the intelligence put into making it. God bless you guys. Edit. Now you can't use this app without subscription. It gives you a trial period, after which, you have to subscribe to use it. It's been good while it lasted. Goodbye, I'm uninstalling now."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

        "recentChanges": "Thanks for using Calm! This update contains multiple bug fixes and performance improvements. As always, you can expect an original Daily Calm every day, new music and Sleep Stories every week, and new Meditation programs every month.",
        "comments": [
            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

Wish a coloured Little Owl icon appeared in the notification bar, as some other blue light icons do. Great effort by developer though, this app would have taken so much work! And it's FREE!

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

        "description": "Welcome to Eye Reliever, the app for the eyes!\r\n\r\nDo you stare at a screen all day, either for work or just on your own time? Do you get dry eyes, eye strain, headaches, or blurry vision? Any or all of these symptoms after long periods of screen time are called Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). Even if you don't have any symptoms of CVS now, as we all stare at screens more in this Digital Age we are increasingly at risk to have these problems.\r\n\r\nBut here's the good news: healthy screen habits can reduce your risk for CVS. To that end, the 20-20-20 Rule is a great rule-of-thumb to help your eyes. This rule says that, when using a computer, phone, or tablet, \"Every 20 minutes look 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. And blink often.\" Sounds easy, right?\r\nUnfortunately, the truth is that it's difficult to remember to take these regular breaks. We invariably become engrossed in what we are doing, whether it's checking e-mail, texting, writing reports, or playing a game. That's where the Eye Reliever app provides an easy solution. This app has a custom-made looping clock that will track the time for you! Just hit the Start button and listen for the alerts. The app will tell you when to take a break with a brief alert sound, and then 20 seconds later another alert lets you know when the break is over. It's that simple!\r\n\r\nSo how does the app work? By following the 20-20-20 Rule, the goal is to prevent dry eyes and eye strain. Let's discuss these separately:\r\n1) Dry Eyes - We typically blink our eyes about 15 times per minute, but studies have shown that this rate drops by more than half when we stare at computer screens. We become unblinking zombies, and you probably can relate to that feeling of how your eyes feel after staring at a computer for a long time. Decreased blink rates and incomplete blinks reduce the quality of the tear film coating the front surface of the eye. As the tear film degrades it evaporates more quickly, which leads to the burning, gritty irritation that characterizes dry eyes. The Eye Reliever app reminds you to take regular breaks and blink your eyes fully and often so that your blink rate never gets into the \"danger zone.\" Think of this like snapping out of the screen-zombie trance.\r\n2) Eye Strain - Computer, phone, and tablet screens close to a user's face (usually 50-60 cm) are a near object that require increased effort for our eye's focusing system. Inside the eye is a muscle that encircles the lens; when we look at a near object, this muscle flexes to change the shape of the lens to make that object clear and \"in focus.\" Like any muscle in the body, it gets tired after extended use. If you stare at a screen for hours on end it's like putting that muscle through a long workout! This is where the Eye Reliever app can help. By taking regular breaks to look away from the screen (at least 20 feet, or just close your eyes) you allow that muscle to relax back to its resting state. By using this app to take breaks through the day the goal is to prevent eye strain, fatigue, and headaches from happening as your workday progresses into the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThat's a quick introduction to how the Eye Reliever app can help you follow the 20-20-20 Rule. Finally, it's worth mentioning that this rule is recommended by both the American Optometric Association (AOA) and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO).

            "Lot of customisations are required for this app 1. Instead of just head notification there should be an option of pop up full-screen notification 2. The pop up screen should be given an option to change the colour of the screen as well as text 3. There should be an option to customise the time of work as well as break, people can take a break of more than 20 seconds of required 4. Just check out Break timer app for windows and you can get lot of customisation ideas",
            "Love it. So many similar apps just have a 20-minute timer, which continues counting down (often in an obnoxious ever-present notification) and continue counting even if your phone is turned off! This is the first app I've found that resets the 20 minutes if you turn off your phone screen. This makes sense because if your screen is off, you're obviously already taking a break from it! The one improvement I'd like to see would be an option to blacklist certain apps, so that the timer is paused (or at least notifications hidden) when that app is on-screen, and/or when an app is in full-screen immersive mode. Things like Waze, Google Maps, etc. or full-screen movies shouldn't be interrupted by eye breaks. I wrote an email to the developer and they responded very quickly that they'd like to include these ideas in the next version of the app!",
            "ten seconds of installing and I'm already disappointed. this is the third 202020 app I've installed that has been unhelpful or buggy. how am supposed to read grey text on a grey background? update: it never went off. what a waste if time i might as well set an alarm instead of dealing with these broken apps.",
            "Worked for the most part for the first day or so, but then it suddenly stopped alerting me. Very frustrating!",
            "It didn't seem to work. Plus, you can't even see how long it will be until the next notification."

        "description": "Protecting your eyesight improver is one of the most important things you can do to help maintain your quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe leading causes of blindness and low vision are age-related diseases such as macular degeneration, cataract, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.\r\n\r\nBlue light filter 2021 is used to reduce blue light by adjusting the screen to natural color. Shifting your screen to night mode can relieve your eyes strain, and your eyes will feel at ease during night reading. Also blue light filter will protect your eyes and help you sleep easily.\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Reduce blue light\r\n- Adjustable filter intensity\r\n- Save power\r\n- Very easy to use\r\n- Built-in screen dimmer\r\n- Eye protector from screen light\r\n- Make sure you are in a comfortable position\r\n- Make sure that there is no glare on the phone's screen.\r\n- Place your phone approximately 40 cm/16 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Close one eye at a time\r\n\r\nTake care of your vision. With this program you can test your vision at home. It can't replace optician's regular full examination or advise of ophthalmologist, but with this vision test you may discover that your eyesight deteriorates and you need to visit a doctor.\r\n\r\nDuring the test you will see different objects. Try to identify shown object. The sequence of objects is random. That prevents learning the sequence and guessing the answer.\r\nHere are some helpful tips to help you avoid vision loss from these age-related eye diseases and other problems:\r\n\r\n1. Find out if you are at higher risk for eye diseases.\r\nBe aware of your family's health history. Do you or any of your family suffer from diabetes or have a history of high blood pressure? Are you over age 60? Any of these traits increase your risk for sight-threatening eye diseases.\r\n\r\n2. Have regular physical exams to check for diabetes and high blood pressure.\r\nIf left untreated, these diseases can cause eye problems. In particular, diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to vision loss from diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and eye strokes.\r\n\r\n3. Look for warning signs of changes in your vision.\r\nIf you start noticing changes in your vision, see your eye doctor immediately. Some trouble signs to look for are double vision, hazy vision and difficulty seeing in low light conditions.\r\n\r\nOther signs and symptoms of potentially serious eye problems that warrant immediate attention include red eyes, frequent flashes of light, floaters, and eye pain and swelling.\r\n\r\n4. Exercise frequently.\r\nStudies suggest that regular exercise — such as brisk walking — can reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration by up to 70 percent.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nThis application is not intended to replace optician's regular full examination.

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

But in bees vision of your apps, red is just red. I think, that's really not happens with them. Best off luck. We need a beeter app on it from you. Thanks after all.",
            "Fake, I know what all the animal's vision looks like and I can guarantee you it doesn't look like what the app portrays. A cats vision is based off of grey, blue, and green colors. They get confused with reds and pinks and see them as grey. If a cat looks at something purple, it will see blue since red + blue is purple. The colors that pop to a cat more, are colors like orange. Its sort of like a color blind person's vision. Snake vision is based off of heat and cold.",
            "This app is so cool I want cat vision because I never knew that cat vision is so cool but it might ruin your life because you can get a little confused of who or what you are looking at in school or in work or in any kind of places that are in puplic",

They let you unlock the pro version if you do a few things like share the app etc but I have done so and I still don't have the pro version that's why I'm rating it lower than I'd like edit: like I said I did do all those things. The app simply did not unlock pro version like it should have.",
            "Cool as heck!!! Downladed to see in cat vision, but this has viper, dog, elephant, etc. etc. I amnalso sharing this app with a bunck of friends as this is real instructive, and usefull."

Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts. Then, when you sign in, you’ll provide your username and password as usual. Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\r\n\r\nEnroll in our beta program!

            "This app is awesome if you forget your passwords frequently or want to add an extra layer of security.. The downside is if you change your password and do not have another way to verify your account (send a code to email or phone number) then you're locked out. Make sure your contact preferences are set before linking your account! Also I have noticed the app doesn't link a lot of services; just Facebook, Microsoft, and Google accounts. I'd like to see more accounts able to be linked.",
            "Amazing app, I really appreciate how easy it is to backup your information so when U get a New Phone, it is so much easier to reinstall with all your info. Let me say one thing, without that backup, it is a BE'ATCH to get authentication up⬆ & running again with all your compatible apps! It is very Time Consuming without that Great Backup Feature!!! My only downfall, I am having big problems with PayPal... it is Never the right Code... WHY❓ It is driving me insane & it is really a problem for me❗",
            "Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works perfectly for Microsoft accounts, and is acceptable for others. I can't have all the codes showing at once, which means an extra tap each time I go to use the app, and I'd like to be able to customise icons for accounts to make it easier to spot the one I'm after. Other than minor niggles, I'm good.",
            "I have no choice but to use this app for my organization, but recently it began requiring me to \"unlock\" the app. I had no idea how to do this so I had to Google for an answer. Turns out you have to use your mobile PIN or biometric to unlock the app. I feel like my phone PIN has been compromised and provided to Microsoft. Unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the usage reporting that is enabled by default that I discovered when turning off this unlock feature. Sorry Microsoft, I do not trust you.",
            "I recommend this application. It is convenient to keep your account security verification code secure. When you login, it ensure that no one will login to your account without your permission. I also love this app more than google authentication. You can backup your info link with your email. It is very good when compare to other authentication app."

            "motivating, fun, exciting and immersive! I adore the detailed audio when incoming zombies or distant gunfire sound as if they're truly getting closer with your pace. \"Letters\" will also be e-mailed to you as you journey through this story. The free version is worthwhile for those looking to enjoy this a couple times a week, since it takes a few days to unlock each episode. Whereas subscription is worth it when you're looking to progress almost daily like myself. I love it!",
            "My favorite running app but... I like it for the entertainment. While the app is much less glitchy for legacy users than before, the distance is way off. I can walk slowly and it will say that I have done a mile every 6 minutes, when I have walked maybe half a mile or less. However, I do love the incentive to run when I have the Zombie chases on, it gets me going and has helped to make much progress.",
            "I love Zombies! Run!! I started running from zombies with the Abel gang in 2018, and never stopped. I only got 2 episodes into Season 1 before I started my subscription, and it has been worth every penny! This is the ONLY app that I cannot think of one single critical comment about. The stories are interesting, the actors are extremely talented, and if the need to find out \"what happened next\" doesn't get you moving, nothing will. Thank you, Six to Start!",
            "I just love this app, it got me running outside for the first time and made me want to go just to hear the next episode! The storyline is great, the app is easy to use and when the zombies chase you, you can't help but sprint 🤣🤣 Wonderful concept and so glad I found it! The other areas of the app like the 5/10/20km running plans are valuable and building up my base is a fun twist too. I recommend this app to everyone, its honestly the greatest motivator!",
            "So I have tried this on 3 different phones and had the same issue. Audio works for about 10 mins and then app goes silent. Have tried with / without music, internal and external player...no luck. As for not looking at app once started...need to remove that statement. Also, no headset start stop. No doubt the OS will be blamed, so uninstalled cause probably no resolve."

(we are able to share only one document at a time from the app.) And next point is 2. give us an option to reorder the pages and mark the number on the page. 3.if we select one filter for an image, it should automatically select the same filter from next time.",
            "I like this app, it's the best scanner and really easy to organise. I didn't give full stars because there isn't an option to edit the name, or edit the documents. Like scan a few more, or delete a few once you have saved it onto the device. If I make a mistake I have to rescan everything. Nonetheless, I am still using this app because there are no ads and it's a quality scanner!",
            "It's a nice app, especially if you have an outlook account. When you save it, it saves directly to your account after you log in once, and you can also choose what to save it as (pdf, jpeg, etc. . .). The only thing is, if you have bad lighting, sometimes the scanner won't pick up the edges of your paper. Which is a given for any scanner, but if you're in a rush it can cost you time. It doesn't have pop up ads like some other scanners I've used so that's also a plus.",
            "This is an amzing app. If we click a photo for scanning from any angle, it automatically makes the photo clear and straight. I could have given 5 stars to this app, if there could be one more feature in it. Today I had to scan the images of my test paper and by mistake, I forgot one page to scan. So I scanned it at the last thinking that *there will be an option to reorder the pages in a correct format*. But I wasnt able to reorder. Please add page reordering feature in this app. Thank you.😊",
            "I couldn't find a proper pdf creator and was in desperate need of one due to my exams. Them I found this and I am so very grateful that I did. Works just fine and captures the document from whichever angle I click. Only one thing, today I forgot to rename the file before saving it. And then I couldn't find any option to rename it. So I had to click the pictures of the pages again. If there is a renaming option, please help me find it but if not, that's an improvement you must make."

        "description": "Protect Your Eye Before It Is Too Late\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know that the computer is only one cause of discomfort for contact lens wearers? Have you ever found your eyes are often dry and irritated when wearing them? All these happen because of bad habits in caring for your lenses normally developed in a group of new contact lens’ users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProperly caring for your lens and following the guidelines for your type is important in protecting your vision and ensuring your contacts are comfortable to wear. See if you’ve been making these following mistakes that could be ruining your contacts and possibly harming your eyes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first mistake is that Cleaning Your Lenses With Water. Your eyes are very sensitive and can easily become infected when you do not clean your lenses properly. The lens develops a build up of deposits that can irritate the eye. Lens cleaning solutions will break down the deposits and disinfect the lens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, water and homemade saline solutions are not clean enough for cleaning contact lens because they can contain micro-organisms, chlorine and other minerals that can damage the lens and harm your eyes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless you are wearing disposable lenses you must clean your contacts after every wear.

Since he installed your app on my old tablet + the one I just purchased.. my eyes aren't as tired, painful or as worn thanks 2 this app.Excellent. Can honestly say I've been using this app for about 3 months and its never given me a difficult time. I get frequent headaches and my job has me looking at a screen all day, so when I use",
            "Blue light filter is Easy to set up and use and works amazingly. Much more preferred over the built-in blue light filter in my phone. Much more control over the filter temperature and dims the screen further than one could normally. Rarely has ads and is extremely unintrusive.",
            "Blue light filter is absolutely great application! Because i always use my phone at night and the light from my screen is unease my eyes.. but now I switched to this night mode and it's felt so warm . I hope that you can make more options on this app in future. Highly remanded.",
            "Blue light filter is very good application. I am hypersensitive to light and couldn't use my phone for more than half hour without this app. I had tried a few similar apps before finally finding this one and there was always a good reason to remove it. 🥰",
            "Blue light filter helps to decrease the light effect displayed on the screen of mobile and tab. You will not feel tired after using the blue light filter. Its help alot. Highly recommended to all of you as its help to protect the eyes. Must try it."

Now I am in a dispute to get my money back that should never had been taken. They suck and I actually rate them negative 10 stars !",

            "It does what it should, respects your privacy/security and is very light. This is the best blue light filter app I have found so far. It does NOT ask for a ridiculously high amount of unreasonable permissions and is really light, causing no impact on the performance of the device. Also, it has all the features needed for the job.",
            "Reduces brightness too! It lets you filter blue color and also allows you to choose other colors to dim/enhance. The best feature is how it dims the screen. I often check my clock in the middle of the night, and the low brightness allows me to go back to sleep right away! Great app, light, and you can set a timer to turn on/off.",

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

            "It's a very good app, but the photo editing options are less. It would be very helpful if there more editing options especially in the colour option. Also, saving the pdf is taking a lot of time. If the time for saving is reduced it would be very helpful. Other than this, the app is great. I can smoothly share assignments using this app. There are no ads in this app which is great! Overall it's a good app but it could be made better by adding some more editing options.",
            "Good app. But this app tends to lag at times. Please make the generation of PDFs faster because it takes a lot of time and because of it, I could not submit my assessments on time. Though the copies were checked, but I had to listen to warnings from teachers. Please make the generation faster. Otherwise it is a very useful app and is handy too.🙂🙂🙂",
            "Finally we have a phone scanner that works about as well as a flat bed scanner! I've tried a few of these types of apps in the past, and they usually had issues. But this one seems to have hit the bulls eye on everything. The auto-detect borders almost always works, the adjustments are easy, the file size is reasonable, the touch-up/edit features work very well, and it doesn't erase your entire scan if your screen turns off because you had to step away for a second (like DropBox does). No complaints about this app so far!",
            "I'm using this to scan my answers to exam questions, then i make them pdf and send to my instructor. This is the best because I can select different filters for better look and legibility. When I pick a filter, I can shoot photos back to back without stopping and it will turn all of them to my selected filter. Also, it has auto-detection for documents. When I direct my camera to a document, it understands the context i dont even need to shoot or crop, it does everything by itself. Super useful",
            "my main issue with this app is that it cannot pick up each section of a certain document consistently, e.g I'll scan a document and half of it is very light and difficult to identify, while in reality it is just as dark as the other half of the page, though this may also be partially attributed to background lighting. nevertheless, this app simplifies processing and downloading scanned documents and for me, is more effective than a standard camera."

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

This app contains high-resolution basic clinical testing tools in one convenient location, and is reasonably priced compared to their printed optometry counterparts. These tools are very useful for screening purposes, but are not necessarily recommended for final diagnosis. There are no advertisements, unnecessary text, and each tool automatically adjusts to an appropriate brightness. Rock-solid performance, a minimalistic interface, and snappy responsiveness ensure efficiency while interacting with patients. A quick reference category is useful for classifying conditions such as high cholesterol, diabetic retinopathy, and hypertension as well as converting values for contact lens fits.

        "descriptionHTML": "Professional Clinical Tools for Android is a professional mobile toolkit for practitioners such as optometrists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, medical doctors, optometric technicians, nurses, EMTs, medical assistants, and other healthcare providers. This app contains high-resolution basic clinical testing tools in one convenient location, and is reasonably priced compared to their printed optometry counterparts. These tools are very useful for screening purposes, but are not necessarily recommended for final diagnosis. There are no advertisements, unnecessary text, and each tool automatically adjusts to an appropriate brightness. Rock-solid performance, a minimalistic interface, and snappy responsiveness ensure efficiency while interacting with patients. A quick reference category is useful for classifying conditions such as high cholesterol, diabetic retinopathy, and hypertension as well as converting values for contact lens fits.

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

Moreover,  memory usage is also low.\r\nAre you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?\r\nAre you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? twilight may be a solution for you!\r\nRecent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\r\n\r\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour.\r\n\r\nThe twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.\r\n\r\nGet more from twilight\r\n1) Bed reading: twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading. Especially as it is able to lower the screen backlight far below the ability of the backligt controls on your screen\r\nDo you feel the light of your mobile screen is too strong?\r\nDo you feel your eyes fatigued after watching the phone screen for a long time?\r\nDoes the glare of the screen make your eyes uncomfortable when you play phone in the bed at night?\r\nDo you feel your vision is blurry after long-use phone?\r\nAll of these problems are caused by the blue light that emitted from the phone screen. Which will bring you eye strain and vision loss if you looked at the screen for a long time without rest.\r\n\r\nNow, with this application, you can easily get rid of the blue light.\r\nWe have these advantages:\r\n- Heavily reduce the blue light to relieve eye fatigue and protect your eyes;\r\n- We have 5 different filter colors for you to choose: nature, red, brown, dark, yellow; \r\n- You can dynamically adjust the filter strength;\r\n- Easy to use, one one button to switch on/off;\r\n- Stable, no force close; \r\n- It's Free!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- easy to use;\r\n- can automatically set default brightness settings in Android to the minimum;\r\n- restore default brightness settings after stop the app;\r\n- keep the screen on while the app is running (optional);\r\n- amazing blue light filter to help you have a better sleep (optional)\r\n- supports dimming the transparent navigation bar in Android 4.4 and higher;\r\n- extra-content: auto-enable & disable feature and one-click widget",

            "2 things happened to me. First is when I started playing on a different device, I came back to this one and all my stuff is gone, also when I purchased gold, the money went out but the gold never came, I've restarted the app, I even did the purchase 3 more times, all three times it withdrew but never gave me the gold, and now with all of my tanks and everything gone. I don't even want to play the game anymore",
            "This is the game where graphics and themes are awesome but same time their technical staff area is worst . They will keep sending you apologies ,give you some gold ,medals etc but they won't be able to restore your credits . Don't know if opponent use cheat codes or not . You will lost around 10k + credits , in a single match and that to the lower opponents . I have send them so many emails but till date they haven't resolved this issue .",
            "2 main issues, the new update doesn't allow the \"collect x amount of supply crates\" mission to work meaning I'm missing out on gold, and there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of silver earned from supply crates, making it much harder to level up tanks. Also, not sure what they mean by \"in game prices are now lower\" as I've seen no change in prices whatsoever. Tank upgrades still show the same price as before and buying anything for gold or money is still the same price.",
            "Great game so far easy to level up good game play great graphics events don't overwhelm you with the need to keep up pvp is optional it has plenty of options for strategy play challenging goals down side is it needs more content it has a place that said (coming soon) it has been some time and it has not been filled perhaps the devs need to install an alliance option in that spot with a leader board come on guys you have done this good keep going",
            "Great game, 1 problem I met though on my Huawey P9: Phone's display doesn't fit the entire game display, mostly the right side, therefore I cannot tap on the right arrow in \"depot - Blueprints\". I gwess this can be fixed by adding a display size option in settings wich I didn't see."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

In this update we improve the call blocking experience for users on Android 10 (“Android Q”) and higher: incoming calls that you wish to block will now be blocked completely, and not forwarded to voicemail! You can enable this behavior by setting Hiya as your default caller ID app. Please let us know of any feedback regarding this change. We also squashed some bugs and ensured things are running smoothly overall.",

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

            "I'm not sure why people are having so much trouble with this app. I love that I'm able to quickly scan old family pictures and share them with others in Google Photos. It's easy to scan the photos, and even if you do tilt your phone, you can adjust the corners easily afterward. I've had a lot of success scanning hundreds of pictures already. Thanks for the great app!",
            "Well . . .! I am having a fair degree of success unlike some other reviews. I reduced glare by repositioning the photo relative to my light source. Have had this app for several months but only used it today for the first time on my new phone which has a good macro camera. I note scans are saved to phone, not external card, why not? Seems to overwrite my preferred camera save location so I have to jump through hoops to then transfer files to external card. Not so good 🙂",
            "The sreps the steps taken in order to Scan are more frustrating, than they should be. Holding the camera to the four corners of the photograph \" without tilting the camera\" allowed the while holding steady was frustrating if impossle with a smart phone. The resulting images were very poor. I tried just using the stocked functions that came with my androids camera and got easer shots with sharper images. I'm sorry guys, I feel generous giving it 2 stars. You're google you should be No. 1 !/",
            "First time use was okay. Then it began not get the scan. You have to move the phone to the four circles to complete the scan. An you only have about 30-40 seconds to do. Which is difficult since your not supposed to tilt the phone. Was unable to find any settings to increase the time frame or adjust the scan time. I am looking for another app that is easier to use.",
            "Terrible quality scans of photos. I got much better quality and higher resolution by just taking a picture of the old 4x6 photo with the camera on my phone. Great idea but poor execution. Hopefully it improves with time because usually I love stuff by Google."
