Thank you so much :) My 2 cents: It would be awesome if there was a speech option to read all the text aloud and each word could be highlighted as it was read. As is, I think I will need to be with my mom to help her navigate the menus and games. Simplicity of big photos with the words on the main page is perfect! But once you click \"math\" the second page should be just as clear and simple (could use symbols +×÷=). Thanks!",

He has a very long term recovery ahead, and this app looks like it would help, but I also have to consider his feelings.",

The encouraging voice is to childish and the whoka word it says is very annoying. Please make this so it is geared for adults. Thank you.",

            "We've been trying for a while, but my 2.5 year old is not interested in trying to repeat the words. I'll likely cancel after the first year. Suggestion for the app developers: In the activities where the kids are teaching a new word, you should add a picture of the item in the corner of the screen while the kids say it. Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",
            "Kept seeing ads for this, so I downloaded it! Started the free trial before I decided to buy a subscription, and so glad I did! I couldn't even get a single activity done. There was no sound, the screen kept freezing and the app keeps force closing. Waste of time.",
            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",

            "I like the app a lot since I'm a speech therapist my self. But there's only one downside. I made the donation and got full access, but after I record my voice when I play it back it sounds like cracking, breaking.... it's not a good recording feature. Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",
            "Most stupid app ever seen. This app doesn't deserve one star. Its a waste of time and data. After downloading 47mb, it still want me to connect to internet before it works. Even with the internet connection it keeps saying cannot connect to the server.",
            "Nice app. Paid the subscription for the full version and found it easy enough to record audio and pictures. Big issue though is that it needs internet access to open the app. Big turn off not being able to use the app at all in offline mode. If this was fixed would consider reinstalling and updating the score.",
            "This helps my son learn to say words by attaching a picture and hearing it say that word. I had trouble getting it to work at first, but after contacting the developer, they helped me fix that problem. Thanks!",
            "Since I've shown my son this app, he opens the app and goes through the menu and attempts repeats the words by himself, without me having to sit and practice with him. Really easy for him to use."

When I finally realized I was being charged $37 US per month I figured out how to canc it through Google but was told there is a no refund policy. I did not use the app after the trial period and think I should get my money back. Apps make it easy to use but difficult if you are trying to unsubscribe or cancel.",
            "I believe the best feature of this help is the videos of kids are actually kids. They don’t sound bossy as an adult would seem to a kid with autism. Since they’re peers to my daughter, she gets encouraged to imitate them and learn from them. We’ve seen the improvement in weeks. She sounds better day by day and the app is obviously beneficial but also fun at the same time enough to keep her focused without feeling like lectured."

In 50% din cazuri nu merge sa le dea drumul la destinatie pentru ca nu exista nici o indicatie ca se afla in locul potrivit. Iar locul potrivit nu este definit corect. Ma chinui si eu in foarte multe cazuri si nu merge, pur si simplu. Am dat 100 de lei sa ma enervez.",

I could be great if it acually worked but it seems as if it did not fully download. I only have maybe 1 out of every 10 pictures on the flashcards. Most videos do not seem to be available. PLEASE FIX!! Ok so after reading other reviews I uninstalled and reinstalled app. Works fantastic now. Would be helpful if they would mention that this seems to be necessary for app to work properly.",
            "It would be great. But I purchased the full version and 60% of the flashcards are blank and say error when you tap them. Memory match freezes a lot Not worth the $20 Also individual letter sounds would be amazing",
            "I would give this app 0 stars if I could, this is a rip-off, be very aware of the \"sale\" it makes you think you are unlocking all the letters for 19 dollars and some change but they only unlock one letter, so if you want to unlock all the alphabet be really to spend OVER $500 dollars, they got me with almost 20 dollars so I'm wondering how many more people are like me falling for it.",
            "Highly recommend. I have used this app both for helping with articulation speech therapy and for kindergarten phonics with my son. It was invaluable in both instances. It is comprehensive and easy to use. Thanks for a great app!",

            "I'm too old to figure this out.... Need something that lets me use the keyboard to type and then read that out loud. Maybe have a library of phrase I've input.... Communication outside of my computer is too tedious no matter what.",
            "This app has been a life-saver; we use it to support our communications with our child on the autistic spectrum. The app in itself has to be personalized, and it is NOT easy.. It is time-consuming to get the personalized images (although they have an extensive generic image bank) up, as well as the pronunciation you wish on specific names or words. And, it is nearly impossible to transfer a profile between android devices. Yes, the app could be better, and it is a shame there is no more technical support offered for it, but I am giving it five stars because it is free, and it has been a massive help to us. Thanks!",
            "I found this yesterday and have been playing around with it-I have 18 years experience working for children who have execptionalities. This is a wonderful app for anybody who may need a voice at times but do not have professional supports in place yet. My son has found it easy to navigate and loves that I was able to personalize the labels. The only issue I've had so far pertains to rearranging the pictures, they didn't stay where I put them.",
            "Trying numerous augmented communication apps for my daughter and this one was the closest to what she use to have on the ipad when the device died. Awesome app. Very easy to set up, a lot of setting options to customize for the needs of the individual and it does not matter how long she pushes the button, it will say the word. Speech can be a little odd but this app gives you the ability to use other voice apps to change the sound. After trying quite a few, this is the one which fit all my needs. Will be donating money to the developer as soon as I can. Great job and thank you so very much!"

            "Very good game! Thus, for language it is important 1.

I would add a possibility to add \"to\" or not. Would be also nice to vary a quickness of a pronounced word as some kids may not be able to get all sounds. It will be also nice to change as color of a word which is pronounced to focus on it and create a link between receptive and written.",

To date, thousands of users have completed over 110 million exercises using Constant Therapy. \r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n\r\n•        Practice speech, language, cognition, memory, reading, attention and comprehension skills anytime, anywhere\r\n•        Choose your recovery goals and we’ll deliver personalized tasks to help you get there\r\n•        See your progress in real time on your performance dashboard\r\n•        Access a library of evidence-based exercises developed by neuroscientists and clinicians \r\n•        Get the most out of Constant Therapy with one-on-one help from Customer Support specialists \r\n•        Try before you subscribe with a 2-week free trial\r\n•        Pair the app with cognitive and speech therapy you’re already doing in the clinic (even add your clinician so they can monitor your progress)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Science Behind Constant Therapy:\r\n\r\nConstant Therapy was designed by scientists at Boston University, and has won awards from the American Stroke Association and AARP. The clinically-proven app is recommended by speech language pathologists, neurologists and occupational therapists.\r\n\r\nIn a recent study of post-stroke rehabilitation practices published in Frontiers in Neurology, outcomes were compared among 3,686 patients who used tablet-based therapy at home independently and those who completed the same therapy in a clinic under the guidance of a clinician. The study found tablet-based home users mastered skills in a shorter time and practiced therapy more frequently than clinic users. Nearly one third (29%) of users who made gains were 71 years old or more, and the oldest user was 97 years old.*\r\n\r\nUsing Constant Therapy\r\n\r\n- Try before you subscribe with a free 14-day trial\r\n\r\n- Users can choose from two subscription plans: $24.99 per month or $249.99 per year.\r\n\r\nContact Us\r\n\r\nEmail – support@constanttherapy.com\r\n\r\nVisit Online – https://thelearningcorp.com/constant-therapy/\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy – https://thelearningcorp.com/privacy/\r\n\r\nTerms of Use – https://thelearningcorp.com/eula/\r\n\r\n\r\n* Study published in Frontiers in Neurology, “Comparison of Therapy Practice at Home and in the Clinic: A Retrospective Analysis of the Constant Therapy Platform Data Set,” may be found at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00140/full\r\n\r\n** Constant Therapy does not provide rehabilitation services and does not guarantee improvements in brain function.

            "Problems for people with dimentia or Alzheimers... It is NOT appropriate to ask them how well they are remembering things, understanding things, etc.as this app does with the user. Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

        "description": "www.speech-therapy-apps.co.uk \r\nYouTube video\r\n https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtsTBfKOs_sgzu06K9CceFg \r\nThis App is designed for children and adults with speech sound difficulties who are receiving Speech and Language Therapy. It is a great way to practice sounds which have been targeted by the Speech Therapist.  The app is full of engaging pictures, fun exercises and games.  This encourages practice and results in better progress with speech.\r\n https://www.facebook.com/pg/speech.therapy.apps/photos/ \r\n\r\nThe Speech Therapy app was developed in collaboration with Kate Biss, Speech and Language Therapist. (http://katebiss-speechtherapist.co.uk) \r\n\r\nSpeech therapy articulation app 1\r\n- contains 7 sounds ( b,d,f,g,h,ch, j)\r\n- 485 words\r\n- price for all sounds is 5.49 GBP  \r\n\r\nSpeech therapy articulation app 2\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pmqsoftware.speech.therapy.uk2 \r\n- contains 7 speech sounds (k, l, m, n, ng, p, r)\r\n- 545  words\r\n- price for all sounds is 5.49 GBP  \r\n\r\nSpeech therapy articulation app 3\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pmqsoftware.speech.therapy.uk3 \r\n- contains 10 speech sounds (s, sh, t, th, the, v, w, y, z, zh)\r\n- 478 words\r\n- price for all sounds is 5.49 GBP  \r\n\r\nSpeech therapy app for children: articulation and pronunciation exercises. The App can also be used with adults to work on articulation, speech and memory.\r\n\r\nSpeech and Language Therapists will find a selection of vocabulary which progresses in levels of complexity.  The target words are carefully selected to represent differences in word position, sound complexity and word structure.  The app also features a useful ‘repeat and record’ facility.\r\n\r\nThe App contains interesting photographs and illustrations across a variety of topics.  The pictures include common objects, nouns, action words and describing words.  These are an excellent resource to support vocabulary development.\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n-  These exercises cannot replace therapy sessions with a Speech Therapist. Using the app helps with daily home practice, making practice fun and motivating.  It is important for a family member to be present and support the child with their practice.\r\n\r\n-   Before starting these exercises, clients must be able to produce the sound in isolation and in simple syllables.  The exercises and games will help to develop the use of the sound in more complicated words.\r\n\r\n-    If you are not sure what to do, check with your Speech Therapist.",

I hope to use this with my nephew, so haven't tried it yet but I have heard good things about talking boards and this looks great! Thank you for offering a free version.",

            "An absolutely wonderful program. I purchased it for supplemental speech therapy for my wife who had a severe stroke, which seriously effected her ability to speak and recognize written words. The flexibility of this program is perfect. She can choose to hear and see descriptive cue words simultaneously. This alone has advanced her skills 10 fold ! Not to mention her favorite part, which is adding her own favorite photos along with text and auditory cues ! Outstanding feature ! She absolutely loves the program and how it empowers her to work at her leisure, focusing on the skills which she needs, but cannot fit into the 2 Speech therapy sessions allowed weekly. I highly recommend this app. For the price, we couldn't be happier.",

When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",

            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

It is a great way to practice sounds which have been targeted by the Speech Therapist.  The app is full of engaging pictures, fun exercises and games.  This encourages practice and results in better progress with speech.\r\n https://www.facebook.com/pg/speech.therapy.apps/photos/ \r\n\r\nThe Speech Therapy app was developed in collaboration with Kate Biss, Speech and Language Therapist. (http://katebiss-speechtherapist.co.uk) \r\n\r\nSpeech therapy articulation app 1\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pmqsoftware.speech.therapy.uk1 \r\n- contains 7 sounds ( b,d,f,g,h,ch, j)\r\n- 485 words\r\n- price for all sounds is 5.49 GBP\r\n\r\nSpeech therapy articulation app 2\r\n- contains 7 speech sounds (k, l, m, n, ng, p, r)\r\n- 545  words\r\n- price for all sounds is 5.49 GBP\r\n\r\nSpeech therapy articulation app 3\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pmqsoftware.speech.therapy.uk3 \r\n- contains 10 speech sounds (s, sh, t, th, the, v, w, y, z, zh)\r\n- 478 words\r\n- price for all sounds is 5.49 GBP \r\n\r\nSpeech therapy app for children: articulation and pronunciation exercises. The App can also be used with adults to work on articulation, speech and memory.\r\n\r\nSpeech and Language Therapists will find a selection of vocabulary which progresses in levels of complexity.  The target words are carefully selected to represent differences in word position, sound complexity and word structure.  The app also features a useful ‘repeat and record’ facility.\r\n\r\nThe App contains interesting photographs and illustrations across a variety of topics.  The pictures include common objects, nouns, action words and describing words.  These are an excellent resource to support vocabulary development.\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n-  These exercises cannot replace therapy sessions with a Speech Therapist. Using the app helps with daily home practice, making practice fun and motivating.  It is important for a family member to be present and support the child with their practice.\r\n\r\n-   Before starting these exercises, clients must be able to produce the sound in isolation and in simple syllables.  The exercises and games will help to develop the use of the sound in more complicated words.\r\n\r\n-    If you are not sure what to do, check with your Speech Therapist.",

        "description": "This educational game for kids trains speech and logic. It is best for children ages 4, 5, 6 and 7 years old.\r\n\r\nEach of the tasks presents a sequence of pictures on the screen that together tell a story, yet the pictures get mixed at the start of the round. The child has to put the pictures back into the correct order and tell the story these pictures display. The game effectively trains the ability to speak in complete and meaningful sentences as well as to come to logical conclusions based on observed facts. To place the pictures in the correct order, children need to first establish causal, temporal, spatial and other logic relationships between the smaller pieces and demonstrate a rather high level of abstraction. Examining pictures itself trains attention and concentration.\r\n\r\nAsk your kid to tell a short story or in some way explain why the pictures should be in that order as well as what happens on the pictures. Each story has a beginning, then some development, and finally an ending. All the pictures are realistic, colorful, and aimed at young kids.\r\n\r\nThe game offers tasks with 3 levels of difficulty:\r\n1. Easy - sequences of 4 easy pictures (for example, 1. whole apple, 2. bitten apple, 3. half-eaten apple, 4. apple core)\r\n2. Medium - sequences of 4 pictures which together make a small story with a simple plot\r\n3. Hard - sequences of 5-6 pictures with a longer plot where the child needs to establish temporal and causal relationships",

            "This a great app developed by an amazing speech therapist!! Her methods have worked wonders for my twins and this app is a great supplement for at home/on the go practice. Not to mention the kids get really excited to \"do their words\" now! My only concern with the app is that test results don't transfer from separate devices for Android users. If there was some sort of log in and out feature for the app, I believe the entries could be saved on any device the app is used on. ☺️",
            "What a rip off, the 'phrases' and 'sentences' are literally the same for each word in the set of sounds. For example, if you do B sentences it will be 'Bob will beg for a big banana', and then 'Bob will beg for a big ball'. Saying the exact same sentence with one word difference is ridiculous. Don't buy.",
            "I signed up for the free trial and couldn't hear any sound. I then subscribed for a paid version even though I still had the free subscription, and still no sound coming out from the app. I sent a mail to you yesterday about this and I haven't gotten a response. It's getting really frustrating!!!!",
            "The One-minute Articulation app is an all in one speech app. It introduces vocabulary, allows the student to practice and test fluency of words and word phrases. As a parent it gives you a clear understanding of where your student is verbally and how to help your student communicate.",
            "A very fast, simple and easy yet effective way to train children to say and practice their sounds correctly. My kid loves to see her results and all the sounds she has done! This is a fabulous way to teach speech to children!"

        "description": "Train your brain to listen carefully with this professional speech therapy app. Three activities help you with understanding sentences, following directions, and improving language processing. If you’re looking for a speech therapy app for adults with communication and cognitive impairments that takes understanding beyond single words, this is the app for you. \r\n\r\n** Try for FREE by downloading Advanced Language Therapy Lite **\r\n\r\nAdvanced Comprehension Therapy will help you find where comprehension breaks down, then help you build it back up with 3 classic speech therapy activities targeting sentence-level listening and reading comprehension.\r\n\r\n1) IDENTIFY the picture that matches the sentence, increasing in syntactic complexity. Start by finding the picture that matches a sentence like “The baby is sleeping.” Work up to finding “She is given a gift by him” from closely related pictures.\r\n\r\n    • 12 levels of difficulty for understanding sentences with 730 unique trials\r\n    • Listen, Read, & Both modes to focus on auditory, reading, or total comprehension\r\n    • Includes those tricky pronouns (he/she/they), indirect objects (to her, to him), reversible sentences, & passives\r\n\r\n2) BUILD a sentence by focusing on each word & how they all fit together.

            "Wont open comes to a page saying not found then loops back to google play Update contacted Google for refund, Google said contact developer. Developer says contact google. Thanks for the run around on an expensive non working app.",
            "Very supportive and responsive support. App has an easy to use UI for communication and seems to be quite customizable. The PIN function to restrict changes to settings is very useful. It does install all images locally but that also allows the app full functionality even when not connected to the internet. The app comes with multiple different page layouts on installation, and has the ability to create custom pages as well. However, I did have to explore myself the various settings and options available in the app, and how they changed the functionality and interface of the app. The degree of customization is great, such as custom buttons with personal images and sound recordings for true personalization of expression but these options can feel a little overwhelming for those that are unfamiliar with AAC apps or communication apps in general. Some sort of in app onboarding to help new users customize the app to their communication needs where new users can view the default page types/layouts easily when they first start the app, and a help/guide function or library explaining the different options available to users as far as customization and control goes would be very helpful. If there is a manual included in the application, it is not easily located. Otherwise, this app suits our needs perfectly, and I would definitely recommend this app.",
            "Wonderful speech app and incredible customer service. We've been using Proloquo2go for years and with each new version it is increasingly difficult to use, NO customer support in the US, and is so ridiculously expensive. Our school recommended TalkTablet and we are so much happier now. It has been a breath of fresh air. So much easier and more intuitive to use. No comparison. And the fellow we called at TalkTablet with some questions, before and after purchasing was outstanding 5*",
            "I am a community support worker who supports many people with speech difficulties of different types. This app is by far the best app in versatility, usability, and price. Customer support is the best that I've found, you accually get to talk to a real person if there are any questions which have been far and few in between do to the extreme user friendliness of this app. I can't say enough good things about the creater of this program, it has changed many people's lives.

        "description": "Designed for individuals on the Autism spectrum who are non-verbal or have minimal verbal skills due to a motor speech planning disorder such as apraxia.  \r\n\r\nChildren with apraxia of speech have difficulty planning speech movements of the tongue, lips, palate and jaw (articulators), hindering their development of verbal speech.  \r\n\r\nDoes your child have challenges with everyday activities such as:\r\n\r\n- Blowing their nose\r\n- Spitting out toothpaste \r\n- Mastication and Pocketing food\r\n- Imitating or making sounds  \r\n\r\nThis app utilizes the highly effective concept of video modeling and auditory cues to promote awareness of oral structures, coordination, muscle grading, tone, chewing, the swallowing of food and saliva and speech clarity; eventually working towards students gaining the ability to speak for themselves. In clinical trials, the VAST videos have been highly effective in increasing a child’s ability to attend to a communication partner’s mouth in the natural environment.\r\n\r\nThe VAST Videos are organized into 4 categories: Syllables & Sounds,Functional Activities, Oral Kinesthesia and Sensory Integration. All activities are designed to:\r\n\r\n-Promote awareness of oral structures and articulators\r\n-Increase speech clarity\r\n-Improve coordination, proprioception, tone & muscle grading of articulators\r\n-Encourage skills for functional activities that include blowing, sucking, chewing and licking\r\n-Increase awareness and ability to swallow food and saliva, while decreasing pocketing of food\r\n-Promote carryover from therapy to home\r\n\r\nThere is a growing amount of clinical evidence that suggests motor speech impairments such as apraxia are a significant factor in hampering the development of verbal speech in children with autism.\r\n\r\nTraditional Motor  Speech Therapy will have students watch a therapist say a word or syllable then repeat the activity (usually X10).  This technique does not usually work well for people with autism due to the challenges with making eye contact or looking at a person’s face.  It is difficult to see how the articulators move when the ability to look at the face is fleeting. \r\n\r\nThe videos in this app make it possible to effectively demonstrate pre-speech and functional motor movements without the challenges of face to face interactions - students with autism may intently watch these videos, free from the distraction of personal interaction.  \r\n\r\nVR GOGGLES\r\nTo decrease visual distraction and focus attention on a desired task, use VAST videos with VR goggles. This increases an individuals perceptual load to relevant information and decreases irrelevant visual/auditory information that may be distracting.\r\n\r\nRESEARCH\r\nVideo Modeling is an Evidence Based Practice (EBP).  A significant amount of research has shown video modeling to be rapid and highly effective not only in teaching new behaviors, but also in generalizing and maintaining these behaviors as well - particularly when using multiple videos showing the same skill across people.  Video Modeling involves the individual or child observing a videotape of a model engaging in a target behavior and subsequently imitating that behavior.\r\n\r\nMIRROR\r\nThe optional mirror feature promotes oral motor sequencing and self-monitoring. Using a mirror while practicing speech sounds and oral motor movement can provide visual feedback to help individuals improve their muscle coordination and sequencing for speech production. \r\n\r\nThe video feature can be used to capture a video of the student themselves producing the target sound or activity. Visual input can be an important source of feedback in remediation of developmental apraxia of speech. Individuals should focus on how to produce the target sounds/movements from a model and then observe and monitor their own attempts by using a mirror/video/camera.",

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: K is an all inclusive app that teaches you how to say K and then how to teach and cue your child how to say the sound. We will then walk you through how to systematically practice K in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say K correctly in the word \"cave\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices K by saying \"kick\" while playing soccer, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say K\r\n~Tips on how to teach K to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say K and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say K correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online K flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying K\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on K for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for K even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

Writing Therapy also has a built-in cueing hierarchy to give \"hints\" on each level, making the exercise one step easier to allow success on each trial. A virtual set of letter tiles makes therapy go faster with more repetitions in less time. \r\n\r\nYou can add your own words and pictures to create completely customized spelling lists! Learn to spell names, places, or words related to each user's needs. \r\n\r\nThis app features clear photographs, iconic graphics, and a clear male voice in 5 languages. Users will benefit from the trial-and-error format and self-selected cues for learning these common words with graduated activities that will grow with them as they develop or improve. \r\n\r\nSettings allow limiting the length of the words, selecting capital or lowercase letters, designating which of 12 categories are presented, and choosing how letters are selected. For users with difficulty dragging, an alternative tapping access method is available. Speech-Language Pathologists, family members, and teachers can recommend the appropriate modes and levels for each user and receive e-mailed reports of results (ready for professional progress notes). \r\n\r\nWriting Therapy is another powerful app in Tactus Therapy Solutions' professionally-designed Language Therapy suite of speech-language therapy apps.

My two year old loves this app and within a week learned most of the words. I love the fact that it is great to use on ipad, vibrant colors, and it is great quality. I think this might be the best app I downloaded in a while.",

My 2 year old loves it.This is a great virtual picture book that has nice colourful illustrations/pictures that are in both English and in our case Spanish.Since we are bilingual family. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a bilingual app for children!",

            "I love this app! My grandson absolutely loves playing this, there are so many learning tools in every game they have. If you want a great learning app for your littles I highly recommend Wonster Words, my grandson has been playing this app since he was two, he's now three and still loves it!",
            "This was much better when we first got it, 2-3 years ago. We have paid for the app. Biggest issue right now: I am really disappointed with the pop up request for a survey which you can only get rid of by agreeing to be redirected to a web page. You should be able to press around the box to get rid of it without being redirected but can't. My daughter is too old for it now, but my son still enjoys it. However, I think it now has LESS educational value than when we first got it and I am considering deleting the app. There are better apps out there if you want educational content. This is an ok app if you mostly want to distract the kid while they MIGHT learn something.",
            "Unimpressed; I see little educational value in this. I did the 7-day trial subscription, and all I see is repeated shape-matching - you don't really have to listen to the sounds or anything; it's just matching shapes. It basically just gives you an outline of a letter, you drag the matching letter to it, then it gives you another one. Am I missing something?",
            "This app is a fun way of learning soo many things especially phonics, alphabet and so on. This is so good my kids loves it a lot. They can't have enough of it at all times. Thanks to the developer 🤩🥳🤩",

        "description": "People with memory impairments can become worried when they don't remember where they are or other important information. They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\r\n\r\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information.

Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

Strengthening this essential skill can improve reading, concentration, memory, attention to detail, and speed of processing. \r\n\r\nTwo powerful modes help brain injury and stroke survivors with left neglect improve at home while also helping occupational therapy (OT) and speech therapy (SLP) professionals to efficiently assess for right or left neglect and provide more effective treatment.\r\n\r\n• Use the Test mode to determine if and where a visual attention deficit exists.\r\n• Use the Practice mode to train scanning by finding targets in order.\r\n\r\nSee how it can help – download Visual Attention Therapy Lite for FREE!\r\n\r\nCancellation tasks just got better.

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

This app describes how to say J and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice J with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say J correctly in the word \"Jeep\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices J by saying \"juice\" during meals, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say J\r\n~Guide on how to teach J to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online J flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach J to your child.\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying J\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on J for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying J!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "I absolutely love this app. It is beyond any other \"so called\" educational app. This is so intuitive and really engages my kids. I have a child with exceptionalities as well and she is able to navigate, understand and learn the concepts. I love how the content is tailored to the age of the child. My son is able to learn more advance subjects by changing the age. The best part is that there are ABSOLUTELY NO ADS and it is free!!! I highly recommend this to all parents.",
            "I am absolutely in LOVE with this app! It has the best learning material and no ads. Perfect!! I was looking for something educational for my 7 and 4 year old, and this is the only one I will ever use for them. It's perfect. Seriously deleting all other learning apps and games because this is the only one they will ever need. I can't believe it's completely free and no ads. Thank you so much for making this amazing app free for my children and helping them learn. I am so greatful!!!",
            "My little niece loves it! Everything is VERY clear, easy to understand, fun and really helps keep their attn while learning! NO ADS and NEVER boring!! Can't believe this is a FREE APP!!! KAK doesn't give kids the answers, they have to actually figure things out (and learn), which is wonderful! The fun (sometimes silly) songs and educational stories are great!! There's constant positive reinforcement, throughout. If they get an answer wrong, they're encouraged to keep trying. EXCELLENT APP 👌!!",
            "We love this app! It's one of my son's favorite things to do on his new tablet. He calls it his \"learning\". I do wish you could track progress through the regular Khan Academy (as he has an account there), and there's definitely a need for more to do offline. We like to use this in the car or while we are out for very long periods of time, but he is getting bored with the small bits he can do offline. Otherwise, this is a really great app, overall.",
            "Picky 4 and 6 year old enjoyed the challenges. Most of the time, I have to remind them to try the apps but not this one—they voluntarily uses it. The user interface of the app of a thumbs up too. It's easier for parents to find a subject and see which topics from their list hasn't been opened yet because it shows a check sign once you're done with a certain topic."

            "I'm not a huge game player... But I like the fact that it doesn't have intrusive ads, and that you can progress through the game at a reasonable pace without hitting any paywalls either. The levels range from easy to somewhat challenging. Although I think some instances I'm still figuring out the rules. ;) I also like the sounds in the game. It's very satisfying. The fish are cute/funny too. I keep the music off though. Lol I really have no complaints about this game. It's fun!",
            "Very Addicting, Very Frustrating The game is cute and a great way to kill time. The explosions and completing levels are extremely satisfying, and I find myself playing for hours at a time. I'm not upset with the whole pay to play thing, as I get it, it's the way these apps make money. But some of these levels can take DAYS to win, and it's like, why am I spending so much time on this? What am I gaining? I just saw a review of a guy who's been playing 4 years to get to level 3K and I'm like nah",
            "Not as advertised! I downloaded because of a facebook ad that looked interesting but was disappointed by how misleading that actually was. I only found out once downloaded that it's basically a glorified candy crush game, with the ad I saw being only a mini game you can sometimes play. They tried to make it interesting by using the coins you earn to decorate an aquarium. But that's not even close to what I was looking to play so after about 10 minutes it was uninstalled due to boredom.",

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: B is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say B and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice B with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. So, I created a not so shiny app that will actually help your child. In order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say B correctly in the word \"border\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices B while playing and saying \"ball,\" carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say B\r\n~Tips on how to teach B to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online B flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying B\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on B for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying B!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

For only $2, you will have everything you need to practice speech therapy for SH at home.\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: SH is a comprehensive app that describes how to say SH and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice SH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say SH correctly in the word \"chef\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices SH by saying \"shut\" every time he/she closes a door, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say SH\r\n~Tips on how to teach SH to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online SH flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning and reading at first. Then, you just have to carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying SH\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on SH for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying SH!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

        "description": "Speech Therapy: N\r\nDoes your child have trouble saying N? We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nN is one of the first sounds a child learns how to say. When he/she doesn't say it correctly, it can be frustrating! To ease this frustration and provide parents with all the tools they need, we created Speech Therapy: N. Speech Therapy: N is a comprehensive app designed by an ASHA certified, practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say N and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice N with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say N correctly in the word \"north\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices N by saying \"nighty night\" while playing house, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say N\r\n~Tips on how to teach N to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online N flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying N\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on N for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying N!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "Great for those idle moments at the various jobs I've worked. It's a fun twist of a platform runner type of game. The different gun sounds are also quite entertaining. Not to mention hearing \"HEADSHOT\" the way the game does it is satisfying. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something complex, but other than that I enjoy it.",
            "Honestly, I got bored of this after a while so I deleted it, but I hot it back today and it's just how I remember it. It's a pretty fun game. It's simple but fun. Turn in airplane mode if you don't want any ads but you won't get any skins or free guns. Other than that I'm done rating for now. All in all I think this would be a good download for you",
            "Not a bad game. There's quite a few ads, but that's expected from a free game. Gameplay is repetitive but still fun. My issue is with updates. It's been months since there has been an update to story mode, hideout, or gun skins. There hasn't even been new guns or outfits to unlock in the weekly challenge. It's just hammers to unlock, which is pointless when I already have the hideout built completely.",
            "The game is very fun. The ads are reasonably spaced out, about one every 2-3 levels. The gameplay is fun, and you are able to pick how you want to play. The different guns don't have that much of an impact on the difficulty, allowing you to pick your favorite gun, regardless of how much damage it says it does, because everyone except the occasional boss goes down in one hit.",
            "I like the looks of it, but all the movement is automated. The only thing you do is tap the screen when your laser gets on the targets. If I controlled more of the game, I'd like it better. But the concept and art is on point."

THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",

            "I love this game.its great and very fun. Please return this game back to when we could play it without data. I want to be able to play without data. Thank you. This game is best cooking game i have ever downloaded, but we are playing with money, (data) that's why am giving it 4 stars. Otherwise i ought to give it a 5 star. Please look into my request. Thank you.",
            "My favorite game that has actual goals to reach. I never put money into the game. There is a mini game you can win gems to help with upgrades and ads if you want to get extra coins, but are not required to play. It's definitely challenging. I do dislike how some upgrades won't help you at all get three stars on some levels though. So, there is a requirement for certain upgrades to win a level with 3 stars...but you won't know until you keep upgrading everything.",
            "The game is addictive, no doubt. Everything is very good, loved it. Giving a 3 coz it takes a lot of diamonds to pass a level and there's no such source of earning them. Playing a level over and over again because you don't have enough diamonds to update is totally frustrating. If you want us to pay so many diamonds for things so at least let there be a good source to earn them.",
            "Fun and challenging levels that test hand-eye coordination as well as cognitive acuity. Some of the restaurants have similar foods, but the builds are always fun and creative the further along you get. The only downside is the number of diamonds needed to upgrade and progress. Tech support has been fantastic. I lost my progress in 2018 and deleted the game out of frstratio. 2 years later they were able to restore my account. Thank you!",
            "The game is nice,i have to give that much to the developers. The issues i have with the game-the only reason i rated it 3 stars-,is that it is data consuming.You need data to do virtually everything in the game. Firstly I downloaded the game with data,then to play the game you have to connect to the internet at all times. And as if that is not enough, after acquiring enough coins and gems to buy a new restaurant, you would still need to connect to the internet to download its contents. NOT NICE"

I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt.

            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",

This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

            "1.A good game but you can't go further because for upgrading very last tier car's u have to use a lot of money no problem in that but if we participate in other race I just got very low money as compared to money I spend to upgrade car's.😑😌😬 2.It is like compulsory to buy in game money from INR or USD if u don't buy in game coins,gold's etc. You can't be able to move further and upgrade all the cars in the game it's like impossible 😤😤",
            "Game seems like it would be decent but it is unplayable. The game won't let me do a single race or ranking race. It worked fine for the first 30 mins or so after install but now won't let me play either of those two modes which are the primary modes I'm the game.",
            "At first few minutes , I played and it's fine . Then , after 5 minutes , I can't play on street racing mode and ranking mode . What happen ? I mean , the loading really slow and i think this is a problem . You guys might wanna solve this small issue",
            "Good game! WELL IT WAS UNTIL I DOWNLOADED THE UPDATE NOW ALL I GET IS RIPPED OFF!! RACED VERSUS MODE AND GOT THREE DEEP IN REWARDS AND JUMPED ME BACK TO THE BEGINNING!!!! AND WHAT'S WITH THE CARS IN VERSUS MODE MY CAR CAN BE 100 OR MORE STRONGER THAN MY APPONENTS AND I STILL LOSE!!!! DOESN'T SEEM WORTH THE EFFORT!!!!! ONLY THING TO DO IS UNINSTALL AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE SO SAD GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE DOWNLOADED THE UPDATE LESSON LEARNED!!!!!",
            "All over best game , but only one problem that when i play event mode it say to turn on net , but when turn on my net then also event is not coming . So please correct event mode in the game."

            "Nothing really works, unless it's a function that entails you giving them money. Never an issue, there! But, the biggest turn off for me is the PvP arena. There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

        "description": "Speech Therapy: R\r\n\r\nR, the dreaded R! The R sound is one of the most difficult sounds to pronounce in almost any language! Many children have difficulty saying it correctly, but don't worry! We are here to help your child today.\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: R is an all inclusive app that teaches you how to say R and then how to teach and cue your child how to say the sound. We will then walk you through how to systematically practice R in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say R correctly in the word \"rake\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices R by saying \"more\" while playing blocks, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say R\r\n~Tips on how to teach R to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say R and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say R correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online R flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying R\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on R for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for R even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!<br><br><b>What&#39;s Included:</b><br>~Explanation on how to say R<br>~Tips on how to teach R to your child<br>~A video showing exactly how to say R and explaining common errors<br>~A variety of cues for helping your child say R correctly<br>~Word lists<br>~Picture Flashcards<br>~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level<br>~Online R flashcards<br><br><b>What you can expect:</b><br>This app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! <br><br><b>Who should use this app:</b><br>~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying R<br>~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover<br>~Children who have been working on R for a long time!<br>~Children who don&#39;t qualify for speech services for R even though they have trouble saying the sound!<br>~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips<br><br><b>Who made this app:</b><br>This app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don&#39;t always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. <br><br><b>Enjoy!</b><br><br>This app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "Best Way strategy game I would give it 5 stars, if not for this few things I wish the developer would add very soon 1. A way to vote out a clan leader: some leaders can't access their game accounts anymore. So they begin afresh, but resuming their leadership role becomes impossible, so they and clan members are force to abandoned clan cos of inactive leader. Please make it easier to change leaderships in clans to save clans 2. Please include clan battles and gold sharing. Thanks",
            "I like the game but if you could just buy the game and pay for updates i think i would spend money. The way its set up its like a never ending nickle and diming. And whoever pays gets more advantages which isnt really strategic so much as pay to win. Also, i feel like im playing a computer many times even when it says im playing wifth or against another person... i dont know. Also, it doesnt take much strategy for someone to sit in their base and develop a nuke (sPaCe StRiKe) and just blow U up",
            "Great game once you get to level 7 where skirmishes are avaliable this game is a real rts but its not for a casual player as game play is slow do you need time to invest. This is a pay to win and things are expensive but you can also invest time and get the things another (research) production queue would be great devs also but please don't miss out on this game its very good once you get into it. Thanks",
            "Game doesn't load after its open, I am done waiting and unsitalling it right now. I used to love this game a lot but now this issue has killed the vibe, i would appreciate the developer team to fix it as soon as possible. Really want to play it again Just because of this issue i have given it 1 star",
            "The game is good and the graphics also.. but for now i just give a 4 star.. i wish that you can fix a minor problem that i encounter like sometimes the troops dont know where to go when i ordered them.. they just walking to somewhere dead end area."

            "Good exercises. However, the note names should be independent from the language of the interface. I cannot select English as the interface language and \"Do, re, mi, fa, sol, ...\" as the note names. English should serve as a language between the cultures. Therefore, the app is not ideal for me, as I learn music in the Romanic system. I will give you five if you correct that. French is not available.",
            "It's a great and versatile app, only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes it's a little glitchy when adjusting settings.",
            "I really liked this app. But somehow today it's giving me wrong answers which defeats the purpose. Hope it'll be fixed soon",

Its a game to kill time. I love it sooooooooo much👌👌😊😊 its better than other games and its name is also very very good. It contains new bottles and new stuff.I vl always give it 5 stars Regards Maiyra Narang",
            "I really love this game. Never gonna uninstall it. Super-Realistic graphics, (as the name itself says, 3d), the outdoor one is really cool. There are no bigs, but the ads are bugging. Otherwise, its the most awesome game around and I have suggested all of my friends to install it. Keep it up 👍👍",
            "It's fun and really a good way to kill some time. U don't have to face any ads when u don't play it with ur internet. But, the thing which is annoying is an ad pops up even when u didn't on ur Wifi. About the game itself, like an ad to buy a premium/ VIP or something... Which contains new bottles and stuffs like that. I tried closing the ad but every time I finish the stage or die (in the game), the ad shoves up. I'd really appreciate if u could fix it. Still gave it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "Bottle flip 3D it is such a good game it's like it's so addicting but there is one downside to it there's no way that you can like play together cuz me and Avery like to play and we wish there was a way that you could like do it together or there was a leader board or scoreboard or something just so that we could know if you are good at the game and there's not a lot of ads and I really love this game so please can you like make a bottle for 3 2 or can you make a upgrade ☆☆☆☆☆♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ good job!!!",
            "It is a good game but way too many adds! AND level 63 is in possible to beat I think I tried it about 26 or even more times. 😡 My advice don't waste your time and data on the continues for levels in the 50s or 60s. 🤔 Hopes this helps people who have read this information 😁 bye peeps! 👋😎"

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "Hey its ya boi Gary I have been playing for almost 2 and a half years and this game is just fine.. the only \"bug\" is losing connection.. if you read it it can tell you if you are haveing connection issues or it is your opponent.. The new powers are. well new. they tweak them and sometimes completely change how they work so if you dont like them tell them why.. dont cry about it And lastly, i was extremely bored and looked at the 1 star reviews.. think before you post",
            "My favorite game on Google play. I play this game constantly while I have wifi. I bought the club arena pass (at half price) a while back and I thoroughly enjoy playing in the double income arenas. I only buy games MAYBE once a year on Google Play. If you're a fan of BTD and you're wondering if it's worth it, I think it is. You can either get it for it's regular price or check back when it's half price.",
            "Love this game. At the beginning it can be tough until you unlock all of the towers but once you get the hang of it it is a really fun and competitive game. My brother and I play against each other to see how far we can get without dying (our record is level 54) I would absolutely recommend this and have recommended this to friends. Best free game and it is not pay to win which is a bonus",
            "it's an amazing game, I am a competitive person and this makes the game even more enjoyable... at the start it is difficult but once you get all the towers and get a lot of the upgrade tiers the game is so much fun. I also like the game because of all the strategy involved. and that's why I rated this 5 stars but it deserves 10 stars!",
            "Its a great game! But i also think they should add a mode where you have a set amount of money, say, 200k and then have like speed bonanza and old school and stuff luke that for different modes in thus mode... And then try and defend to a certian round, And then there are special buffs, say all towers's cooldowns are reduced to .0001 or something idk just random and then the buffs could last the whole game... I just think that this would be a lit addition to the game. cya! 😎"

It is NOT just a simple game where a child practices saying sounds while naming pictures. Instead, this app is a tutorial. You, the parent, will first learn how to say S and then how to teach and cue your child to say S correctly. Next, we walk you through how to systematically practice S at the syllable, word, sentence, and conversational level. We provide game ideas, flashcards, and explanations of what you are doing and why. \r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say S correctly in the word \"snake\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices S by saying \"yes\" while eating at the dinner table, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say S\r\n~Tips on how to teach S to your child\r\n~The difference between lateral and frontal lisps and how this affects practice\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say S and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues on how to help your child say S\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Syllable level practice guide\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Photo Flashcards\r\n~And more!\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect: \r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas.

To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

        "description": "Speech Therapy: CH\r\nDoes your child have trouble saying CH as in \"cheese\"? We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: CH is a comprehensive app that describes how to say CH and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice CH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say CH correctly in the word \"chipmunk\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices CH by saying \"cheeseburger\" while eating dinner, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say CH\r\n~Tips on how to teach CH to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online CH flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning and reading at first. Then, you just have to carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying CH\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on CH for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying CH!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

            "I love this game and play along...I would rate a 5 but they could do a better job with explaining things...and having races that would help finish the cars you have ... I am stuck because I can't get components...",
            "Pretty good game and it's not completely pay to win. Only big issue for me is recently it won't load me into the game. Only fix I've found is uninstalling and reinstalling the game for it just to work for a few hours. Only started a few days ago so hopefully it gets fixed. It first started when I customized a car and it kicked me out. EDIT - Changed to 5 stars because the issue got resolved and no longer does it.",
            "This is a fun and exciting game. But my frustration comes from the inability to get some cars needed for events. Everytime there is an event, it requires me to purchase the car with an asinine amount of money. The game doesn't even afford me the option of spending in-game currency to purchase these elite cars. My only options are spending $20 for 1 car or trying to get it by the rare imports which is impossible. The only key you can use to get a car is a gold key and even then it only component.",
            "After playing this game for a couple of months, I started to enjoy it, playing 20-30 mins each day up until I could not get into my account, every time I tried to get my save data from the cloud it would just start a fresh one. Contacted support, and the reply was\"we are aware of this issue, wait for the next update\"2,3 weeks later still no update,I will not wait months on end just to be able to play a game. The good thing is that I didn't spend any money on it or I would have regretted it."

If not, you might want to skip this app! If it were'nt for all the ads, I'd give the game 5 stars.",
            "Overall the game is good, but dis game is also an ad vector, so it wont stop giving you ads after everytimw u completed a course, even worse its a 15 second ad, can you shorten the ad by removing vungle ads they suck at making ads, i would rate it 5 stars if it werent for ads, and i developed a secret technique: Just disable wifi and mobile data so it wont give you ad now i dont need to pay to remove ad mwehehehehemwehehehehe u cant stop meeeeeeeee >:)",
            "Absolutely amazing and addictive game. I love playing this, but there is one small problem. The thing is that the levels are very hard so if hutch could just make the levels a bit more easier that would be great! The controls and the gameplay is awesome. Overall I LIKE THIS!!",
            "I really like this game. Its interesting to play. But I have problem when I try to do challenges it works perfectly fine. But when connection is lost. At the end of the race it loses my 1st live and asks me to do the whole race again. Please fix it. So that I won't lose a single live. It happened to me 6th time and I lost all lives and have to pay gems to continue. Please fix it. Or I will delete this game. Thank You",
            "This game was fun at first, and I tried it again because of that, after giving it 3/5 stars. I was about to give it 4/5 stars when I reconsidered. The scam of this game is they give you difficult-to-control vehicles and make it nearly impossible to get anywhere without struggling against your machine to get upgrades. Nice work Mattel: Now everyone knows what Hot Wheels are good for. May you and your families Race Off the road, you strategically illiterate schmucks."

            "Game play is fun. However, I feel like they don't do a good job of matching up teams, and the fact that it costs so much for decent weapons. Gold rewards should be higher, and weapon costs should be reduced. I shouldn't have to play for 2 years to earn enough gold to purchase a decent weapon. *update* Since posting this things have changed a lot. The crates that cost 5 gold are finally giving me something other than my 5 gold back, matches are more evenly matched as well.",
            "Weapon upgrade method is good after new update. But what seems to be human hands moving from the ground is not good at all. Because it's against the game being real. And the weapons damage rate is very high. There is little chance of recovery. Control is a bit difficult. And the sounds are unbearable. Over all the game is much better.",
            "This is a great game except for a few major issues which are: 1) the game play is glitchy and not smooth, 2) your aim is constantly getting thrown off if the enemy so much as moves an inch, so you end up missing most of the time, 3) the aim help is no help whatsoever, and 4) every time you are hit or an explosion goes off near you, your gun is thrown around which just compounds the aiming problem. I dont understand what the problem is because Modern Strike Online by Azur has no such issues.",
            "I love this game. I've been playing it for so long and I really appreciate the effort they made to make it more balanced and fairer overall for free-to-play players. But the problems is there supposedly is a gmail that supposedly listens to players' suggestions, critics and problems but I've never got a reply regarding my matters. I really hope that the developers can fix that issue otherwise this game is a must-play and is so enjoyable. I still really appreciate it if I get my problem fixed. ty",
            "I must edit my review to better reflect the real issues this game has. The main issue really isn't that it's pay to play, it's not. It's the match making. The match making causes under upgraded and developed players to be thrown into combat with waaaaay more upgraded players. I like the upgrade system, but perhaps ditching it for a tier based system would work best. Or perhaps adapting the upgrade system to a tier based system would work best. In this way, you can then match make by tier."

            "SO. MANY. ADS. An unreasonable amount in a way I have not experienced with any other game. While I recognize ads help with revenue this feels like it is specifically designed to manipulate you into buying the game (in app purchase options so this is extra annoying). Even if there was an option to watch an ad to have the game be ad free for half an hour that would be a less infuriating option. I even put my phone on airplane mode with no wifi and ads still got through. Uninstalling immediately.",
            "I really like and enjoy the game. I usually turned off my WiFi while playing to avoid watching ads every level so the ads doesn't bother me that much. But I just noticed that for example when I only got one energy left and my phone was lowbat, after I turned it on, I was expecting that my energy was full since I usually turned off my phone for like 2-3 hours while charging, but when I turned it on and I launched the game, my energy remains at one, so please fix it.",
            "im a fan of cooking games and I like this game so far....I like that every time a new restaurant is open it starts from an easy level.. so I don't get bored..unlike the game I use to play that it gets harder and harder that I am unable to play it.. so Im hook with this cooking madness..🤩 I just hope energy and gems are more afordable like 5 pesos? I think I would have bought a lot and spend more if thats the cost.. its better than nothing right?",
            "It's really fun there's not to many ads you don't have to spend money to do a good job or pass the levels and it's easy, I just don't like that if you pass the levels you can only replay them three times otherwise it's fun and addicting 😅♥️💜💗💙❤️ people keep saying there's too many ads but that wasn't a problem for me, I don't get very many ads",
            "Deleted the game for a while. Downloaded again and it ran fine for a while. Now on level 1160 it took my diamonds again. Instead of 3 customers that was supposed to be on there it only gave 2. Now have to wait a while again to get more diamonds. Finished the daily quests and got a no burn item. I guess will delete again cause y'all can't fix the problems. I will not spend real money on a game that can't play right so I know it will just take the real money and not give the right items too."

            "Awesome game! I've played it on the xbox 1 360 and play station 4 and this version for android is just as good! Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

            "Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game, and Sonic as a whole. But this \"free\" version is unacceptable. Far too many ads. This replaced the version I paid for years ago, which doesn't make any difference because the restore purchase button takes me straight to Sonic 2. Can't even find the paid version. Game 5/5, port 0/5 until restore function is fixed (this has been an issue for well over a year)",
            "It's a fantastic adaptation of the game and I would give it 5 stars if not for: - Scrap Brain zone act 2 is broken and loops back to the start of the level -- is this by design? It doesn't allow me to finish the game! - Even though I purchased the game I keep getting one add every time I open the app - I need to be online to play the game - come on man this would be amazing during long plane trips!",
            "I LOVE SONIC but this port aint the best i would rather play and emulated version and when ever i try to use debug it pauses the game i mean come on sega what the hell if this was fixed it would get a big five stars but still i love this game and i hope this bug is fixed PLEASE SEGA FIX THIS!!!!!",
            "One of the best ways to play the original Sonic the Hedgehog. Controls are surprisingly good for a phone port and widescreen definitely enhances the experience. Only problem is that achievements are a bit iffy; it says I got the chaos consiour achievement even though I only have three chaos emeralds. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints.",
            "Not exactly a good experience. Saw three ads from the time I opened the game to the time I made a save & an additional two once I selected start. After the two ads, totalling over a minute, the game crashes, & process repeats. I could see enough ads I'd see from playing Sonic Forces for a week in just half an hour of trying to load a game. The controls are also really funky, making the game over twice as hard as it should. I'm disappointed, I expected better from one of my favorite franchises :/"

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

        "description": "Speech Therapy: T\r\nIs your child working on saying T correctly? If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: T is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say T and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice T with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say T correctly in the word \"taco\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices T by saying \"teeth\" while brushing teeth, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say T\r\n~Guide on how to teach T to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online T flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach T to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying T\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on T for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying T!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "This game is amazing. I really like this game. All of ships is good. And we can make our ship more powerful only with flag. I really enjoy this game. But one problem, the class division of the ships is unfair. Alsace, H41, and montana is too strong for King George V, Bismarck, Iowa, and Missiori. Why the ships that are known to be weaker than ships that never existed?",
            "Great game but if ur gonna have an upgrade on there, y'all should upgrade every item that is present. Not just 2 and it shows 3 things you could upgrade. Need that looked in2. Another thing is it needs more stages and less cost on the ships and there upgrades . And is there any way the developer can make it where's the repair items are a lil less than 40gold.goes for the other 2items as well. With the time ratio being so long to countdown that should be fixed as well please. Thx u",
            "The game quite enjoyable, in the beginning it was so hard since you'll always almost lose a match. A litte trick to reduce this is maxing out one ship, i maxed out royal sovereign and master it and use it to grind (offline is easier). You could obtain all of the ship without spending money at all, but it is based on luck. I've played the game extensively for the first three days and got the chance to open gold container and what do i got is the montanna, the best high tier battleship. Good game.",
            "Gameplay is fine. Progression is slow. Developer needs to add TEAMCHAT, or VOICECHAT w/teamchat. Can't organize the fleet, can't call out tgts to combine fire easily without giving your tgt to the opposite team. This game could be five stars easily. But it needs additional communication options . And a clan/guild system w/ the ability to load onto the same team/game would be a nice add on feature for a future update.",
            "Great game, after 3 yrs, got to level 181, over 10 K kills but got bored and moved on to another warship game. Maybe I'm missing something, but having fleets and alliances would be good. Also, campaigns, even bombarding shore installations...Have enjoyed playing, but wish it had more options for battle.AGAIN, ADD SHORE INSTALLATIONS, along with a decent tutorial for carrier ops."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "It's a dorky 2 d game. But I love it. I play it with my kids. Also toooooooo many ads! I am annoyed to have to watch ads to earn coins to buy upgrades. There should be a way to earn enough through the game. What if I pay$ 3.99 for no ads? How will I earn coins and extra power in the tournaments? I hope the developers of this game get stomach cancer. You think that's harsh? Try literally wasting hours of your life watching all these ads.",
            "Game is great. I have no problem at all with the actual game, HOWEVER, the thing that brought this game down from what could have been a four or five star, was the ads. The moment you open the game, there is no way you won't see an ad. Win a battle? Watch an ad. Loose a battle? Watch an ad. And yes I get that you can spend money to remove ads but a lot of players are freebees, and that really narrows down where you are getting revinue from. Please do something about the ads.",
            "I like the game, but the ads make it unplayable. An ad after every two shots, often before and after every game, and randomly in the main page. Plus you have to watch an ad to actually receive any rewards from playing. I decided to purchase the overpriced ad removal to be able to actually enjoy the game. DO NOT DO THAT!! It does not actually remove all of the ads. You still have to watch an add after every single round just to receive any rewards. This game is not pay to win, its watch to win.",
            "the game is a lot of fun although there is a warning right now there is a lot of ads on this game I would recommend playing with the signal off for such as Wi-Fiso if you don't want to get rid of the fads do not play with Wi-Fi on although it is still a very fun gametank stars is the best game I've ever played that is why I rated 5-stars I would rate it 10 Stars if there was a such thing",
            "When I first played the game I was super happy! I loved the theme and the easy controls! I am not giving it 5 or 4 stars, though. First, sometimes when I got out of the game and then came back the game wouldn't work, and that's not all. The only way to play again correctly was to UNISTALL the game! WHAT THE HECK?! I lost all my progress more than THREE TIMES! Second, because I am not done, there are WAY TO MANY ADS! Every 1 to 2 minutes an ad appears! If it had less ads..."

        "description": "An educational app for kids ages 2-7 featuring games, stories, and cartoons. Learn your ABC’s, letters, numbers, sizes, colors, and shapes! Learn to read by syllables and count! Develop emotional intelligence, logic, and reasoning. Doesn't that sound great?\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about early education for your kids? At which age is it right to start learning the alphabet? Zebrainy is an educational game where you can find all sorts of learning games for kids, no matter how old they are.\r\n\r\nZebrainy will help you to develop kids’ memory, reading skills, matching abilities, concentration, and creativity. It is not a simple ABC game for toddlers; you will find 1st-grade math material, shapes and colors vocabulary, drawing and coloring tasks, “English A-Z”, where each letter has a short cartoon with new words every time.\r\n\r\nOur team consists of professional teachers, scientific consultants, composers, and very talented artists. All these people go the extra mile when it comes to quality.\r\n\r\nGet your toddler ready for school! With ABC games, it will be much easier for your child to learn the alphabet and start reading than in tedious preschool lessons! The colors used in the app develop their imagination, perception, and attention. It's a fun learning game for boys and girls both! If your child is 5-6-7 years old, already knows numbers and letters, pre-school and kindergarten are over, don't worry! The app can still come in handy!  Math and reading are essential not only in the 1st grade, and it is highly recommended to revise the information with a child from time to time. \r\n\r\nWhat the difference between Zebrainy and other educational games for kids?\r\n- It helps your baby to fall in love with drawing, reading\r\n- In just 2 month toddlers will know shapes and colors\r\n- It takes just nine months for your kid to complete the full course preparation for school (you can start in kindergarten or even earlier)\r\n- It is easier to communicate with a kid after using the app\r\n- Multiple coloring tasks will improve your toddler’s imagination\r\n- The app doesn’t separate games for boys and girls \r\n\r\nThe main advantages of Zebrainy: \r\n- It takes into account your child's abilities, gender, age and flexibility of mind\r\n- Kids get awards and a collection of artifacts \r\n- At the end of the day, kids can watch educational cartoons \r\n- In the menu, parents can check the achievements of their children\r\n\r\nThe list of skills except for preschool learning:\r\n- The ability to set and achieve goals\r\n- Navigating in a strange environment,\r\n- Making decisions quickly\r\n- Communicating with others and making connections\r\n- Analyzing different information, and coming to the right conclusions \r\n- It is an educational challenge, so your kid will never get bored\r\n\r\nWhich features differ Zebrainy from the others?\r\n- Artificial intelligence creates a unique program for kids and toddlers due to their activity and age\r\n- Alphabet learning (composing each letter with round elements help develop fine motor skills and visual memory)\r\n- Cartoons and interactive educational processes make it more than simply an ABC game for kids. It answers different needs in every stage of growth.\r\n\r\nSince this is a toddler learning game, it can be used if your baby is 1, 2, or 3 years old,  and it is also a great educational app for preschoolers 4-6 years old, and even 7-year-old first graders! It is a scientific fact that kids perceive everything from birth. So all the commands in the game eventually will form a base for further successful education. We guarantee that your baby will be learning safely and at the correct level.\r\n \r\nYou can send any questions or suggestions to support@zebrainy.com\r\n \r\nPrivacy and Access Policy:\r\nhttp://zebrainy.com/privacy-policy/\r\nhttp://zebrainy.com/terms-of-service/",

Please refund my payment as I cancelled within the day. Thanks.",

Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",

Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",

            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "Terribly pay to win. Everything about this game is unbalanced. And it's daily missions aren't a quick couple minutes here and there to complete they take hours. This developer needs to learn the place of this style of game, its not one that you should be expected to sit down and play for hours a day, rather a few minutes here and there.",
            "I was really enjoying this game however there are a large number of issues. Once you get to level 18+ everything takes to long to upgrade. Parts needed to upgrade ships start to get to high and it becomes boring doing the same daily missions to acquire the parts. All the missions I currently have in progress I'm unable to go further with as I need to upgrade ships to the right power. Can only purchase one pack then it's removed and replaced with a more expensive option",
            "The game, and especially its publisher, sucks. In no case do not install the game to get reward in another game, because the promise of a high reward just a lure. Publisher just increase install base in such manner. The game itself has no originality in terms of gameplay and aimed at the donation, the donation and once again the donation. In my case for reaching level 15 was just an excuses from support you have not completed the task, you are free to walk .. (ticket #8682186 from ironsource)",
            "Be aware that if you play this game it is set up to be pay to win. You can do ok till about level 30 - 32 then it is so difficult to upgrade anything with out buying expensive packages in the store. ($20-$100) The game has no power balance so your at the mercy of anyone more powerful than you. There is no addressing griefers as they spend the most on the game so it grows difficult to advance or do events at times being constantly attacked by ships you can't damage at all. Just don't bother.",
            "Downgraded my review. I have been playing since June of 2019 and this game is definitely a pay-to-win game. The mechanics of the game are pretty easy one you get the hang of it, but you will never get a way without paying $$$$...it's not even that there are micro transactions, it's that they cost $50, $100, and one or two $20 thrown in there. Clearly the developers are making bank as they are large number of players who are level 30 and higher with super strong ships that can be got thu paying."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "I like this game, but a few things I don't get! 1) I have the most points in the Regulation races and am still lying between 9th & 11th in the overall table. 2) When you watch an advert to gain Gold coins, where does the coins go? There is no indication! 3) Why does mine and every other player show there wins as 0 wins, as I have won at least 8 regulation races and about 3 Ladder races! 4) The hot lap, says to race against clock, the clock doesn't start? SORT THESE PROBLEMS OUT!",
            "Overall good game that doesn't require a \"pay to win\" strategy. Great customization tweaks for performance.. Would like to see qualifying rounds for starting position. The endurance races are a little ridiculous, 400 laps can take 3 hours and you've lapped 2nd place 5 times by lap 20. Also AI doesn't seem able to pit and repair cars so in longer races your racing against nothing but slow flaming balls of fire after 10 laps. But issues aside still haven't found a more fun racing game.",
            "I like this game but I wish if the other drivers were smarter instead of just crashing into each other, also I wish if the drivers would stop in the pits because it would just feel more realistic and it's weird watching yourself passing a car half destroyed and on fire. They should add more features like that and make it more realistic. Over all I like it though",
            "Preety good stock car racing game. The controls are better than nascar heat. But what I dont like about this game is that there are no cautions. Also I would like to see more tracks that Nascar currently runs on. Lastly I would give this game a rating of 5 stars if they improved the performace of AI and add a option to add friends.",
            "This is a great game. I would give it 5 stars IF the starting lap was fixed. The cars that arenin the top 3 pos at the start are already about to lap you (i have one of the fastest cars and its still incredibly hard to get back up top). I would love a mechanic to do an actual starter lap instead of using luck to hope the top cars crash"

            "I find the piggy bank mechanic of this game terrible. It makes you feel like you made a mistake, just because you guessed the wrong word to start with. I can not recommend this to anyone but preschoolers, because it is terribly unrewarding and feels like a chore, not a game. But then again, you probably don't want a game with in-game purchases for your preschooler.",
            "Nice app, first time to play. I like it so far..jogs your mind..word memory training .. I'm editing my review here..ads are too much to handle, I think I will have to uninstall..also the game has some kind of bug that freezes at a certain level and you can't go forward although you have enough points to go to the next level!",
            "Love this game!! Ngl though, I don't like the new update with the \"Hippo bank\" and the fact that I have to remember to collect gems after 25 words or else the next ones won't count.. And I already miss being able to see how many words I can get out of one round before I proceed. Idk if you guys care but please do consider bringing back the previous wordcount in some way!",
            "The basic game idea is kind of fun. Unfortunately you end up watching just as much ads as you play the game after a short while. I've played in swedish and there are a lot of words in the swedish language not recognized by the game. Also the game design seem kind of lazy as my phone runs hot playing this while other, more advanced games, keep it nice and cool.",
            "There are many games of the same concept and this has to be the lowest effort of them all. Low quality wallpapers and sounds, common words don't even make it to the crossword and ads are 50% of the gameplay experience. Also you have to be nuts to price 13 hints for 5 dollars. I can literally buy a top notch game on playstore that has a lot more effort and care put into it for that."

Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything. Nothing works and I cannot log in. Deleted app now.",

Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",

The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",

I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",

Like if your like me, you don't mind the ads, but my problem is that I heal the same patients over and again when I come back into the game. But good game overall. I really like your game Pepi Wonder World.",

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",

Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken.

            "Very fun game, but insanely expensive. Want to play single player? You have to pay for it. Want to upgrade your multi-player? You have to pay for it. Then there's the battle pass, premium pass, and thats not even getting to the pop ups after every game spamming you about other deals you can buy. The devs have something here, for the 1%.",
            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",
            "The game was great. Addictive. I am free player and been able to reach to lvl16 but the pain is to constantly watching ads. I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack. But still lots of fun. However this is definitely a pay to win game. Want you obtained Max rank all your characters you cannot continue to advance the upgrades without spending money"

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

The repetitive nature of it is stimulating and rewarding because he feels like he is doing work. But he knows what to do and it isn't overwhelming. I thought that he would find it too simple because his favorite game is Minecraft, which is very challenging. But the music and graphics really strikes a chord.",

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",
            "I LOVE IT! omg i love the mini games, i'll say, THIS IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE! so many things that you can do omg i love everything in this game! specially the events, even the ads bothering me, it's okay. thank you outfit7! i'm looking forward for the future updates! (more activities and games please! thank you so much) 😻🤍",
            "Ok, this game is interesting, BUT! I have some few complains........ When tom grows, he isn't cute at all! And when his emoji level is down, he simply gets angry at me at a certain age. When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "I get sick of trying to explain this to game manufacturers, but 30 sec ads are a thing of the past. All you get is people uninstalling your game and complaining about the ads. Now a game with 5 or 10 second ads will get played and you will subject the player to a lot more ad time. How can you be smart enough to write a game but not be able to figure that out? Uninstalled.",
            "MORE ADS, LESS PLAY This is a pretty fun game but it's sadly riddles with ads. If you skip an ad for a reward, you're met with an ad anyways. That's cheap. Don't be cheap. I would love to see your company implement higher ethical standards when it comes to things like how often you subject your potential buying customers with ads. Right now it's about 10 seconds of game play VS. 120 seconds of ads. If you treat ppl better, they're more inclined to micro pay",
            "Pretty entertaining. However, the ads are excessive and what really irritated me was the coin math wasn't correct. If you watched an ad for a certain amount of coins, you did not receive that amount of coins. It was way less, sometimes a few thousand less. Something that basic shouldn't be wrong in a game. Very irritating.",
            "I wish I could give this a 3.5. Sounds are great, game play is fun, coins are useful and there's always a fun little \"3x coins! Watch this ad!\" Ads aren't a huge issue since you can turn your wifi and data off. I believe more detail on uniqueness should've been done, and more add-ons like bombs, or something that you get further on other than skins that makes the game continually fun. All in all, game is a fun time waster :)",
            "I like the game, pretty nice here, you get more people, fight other armies and bosses. And that is it. But the reason I gave 3 stars, Because 2 reasons. 1: The ads here are terrible. You just keep getting ads everytime you complete a level. 2: There is this weird bug where when I go to next level, this black screen kinda looking things keeps appearing and disappearing on my screen, and whenever that happens, it ruins my advantage of winning. Please fix this annoying glitch, Devs."

The most u can win, even in 1st place, is like $450 & that's if u watch an ad. The car I have now cost me $150,000. Had 2 watch many ads lol. 😄 U can buy $$, but that's cheating.🤥 I do really like this game, but PLEASE MAKE NEW TRACKS FOR US! This GAME is 2 GREAT not 2!! MUCH LOVE & HAPPY HALLOWEEN! ☠🎃👻",

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "The first one before update was very good and excellent. After update whole the game has changed and getting gifts only stars is usually boring. Before that we gets not only stars but also something like 🎀 ribbons. After failing the challenge there is no backup which demotivate player. The game mode story I didn't like at all and challenges are so easy. In the game now the time has came to give some videos otherwise game Will be so much boring. Mission is getting difficult to complete.",
            "Cannot even play the game after I've updated it. I'm forever stuck on the rewards page every single time I run the game. After I've opened the 3 chests, I tap no thanks and another round of rewards keep coming back. This keeps on going and I never get to play the game. Please fix this.",
            "Wow game.. it is so cute actually.. but I don't understand that if we are saving those people then why they are falling in the water or just thud on the ground.. funny game but I am enjoy playing it.. I love to poke the guy with arrow rather than saving him.. Ha Ha ha !",
            "Good game, the mission page went blank with no more updates, but still good cleared everything i could in the game need more new content",

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "The app is one of the best apps out there but the update has not been great at all. It does not give you an option of the voice you really prefer to listen to. At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "This game is AMAZING, however there are a heap of things that make it just 'Good' for me. First of all, there are so many ads! It's taken too much of my internet. Secondly, Premium and other in game purchases are waaaaayyy too much. Thirdly, there are lots of little in game glitches. For example, sometimes I can shoot straight through my enemy and out the other side without it taking any effect. Also, for me online PvP has always been locked. I don't know why. Overall though, great game, enjoyed",
            "I don't normally download mobile games because of how bad they've gotten but this game is certainly on the better side of them. My only problems are you're pressured to buy their premium membership a ton, and there are a bit too many ads, (but you can always go offline for that) and a lot of the characters are only for Premium members. Overall it's a pretty well-made game, I like the references in it; I'd say it's worth the time.",
            "in my opinion, this game gets 4 stars. Dont get me wrong this game is REALLY fun and addictive but the amount of bugs and glitches is crazy like (when the bot shoots a impossible shot) and, the member thing is very expensive in my opinion. but the worst thing about this game is the VIP I used one of the ppl u get with it. Once and it didn't work I got a head shot it didn't work and I was disappointed bc I payed yea plz fix it :D",
            "I have 3 problems. The first problem is the game keeps getting stuck everytime I play it and the second problem is everytime I enter the game it goes back to apps. The final problem is while I'm playing in z days it gets stuck n says the game isn't responding. I'm also pretty sure your game almost gave my phone a virus. It's an awesome game but I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend unless you want your phone to get a virus. Please fix these bugs or i will delete this game.",
            "It is a great game really... but it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I was on the verge of winning a legendary cup when it exited my game and brought me to my home screen. It's not like it used to be. Update the game or else it will suck."

Love this app 😻",

            "Great game, lots of fun. Just like Game of war, mobile strike, and all the other games like this though. Fully pay to win. People spend hundreds of dollars a day and then a handful of whales makes all the kingdom rules and do whatever they want. You can spend thousands of dollars and then wait a month or 2 and be obsolete. Unless you can afford dropping 10-20k in the next year, find another game. F2p will dump thousands of hours into this game only to be dominated and crushed by bullies.",
            "Leave this one alone. 2 years into game. Most expensive game ever. It's just to expensive. Ive put a few 1000 $$$$. In the last month alone around $800 into this game and cannot compete. The developers are money gouging. The game has no enjoyment any more. If you do not spend big you will not thrive. And the cost of healing troops is phenomenal. Do not attack or let others attack you, it will send you broke. Dominated by Asian players.",
            "Decided to download after seeing hundreds of this game's ads, and instantly became addicted. This game is easy to pick up and hard to put down because of the fact that, unlike similar titles like Clash of Clans, this game constantly gives you a feeling of accomplishment and progress through everything you do. Rarely is progress slow either, it's a steady climb of power from the moment you start. Also, people in alliances ACTUALLY help eachother grow and everyone can contribute. 10/10.",
            "I love this game. Much more involved as far as team work goes. That's what I like most. THAT, was two years ago. Now whales have taken the game. If you are not willing to spend time (like 2years) playing mostly if not free. Then stay away! There are actual people here who have spent over 10k USD just to be huge. You don't own the game. They can pull the plug any time they choose. And you gain nothing. I am quitting after playing a loyal and honest game. Those qualities will get you nowhere.",
            "The game is good but some little things can be added to make it better. Also alliance members should be allowed an option to give arrows of resistance. it takes to long to get to the last age. And it should be easier to get legendary commanders like Richard the 1st. They need to work more on the game. It should not take 1 year to get to 10 million power, this game out last your device. It should only take 2 months to get to 5 mill not 9 months. Also your verification system is very annoying. 👍"

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: P is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say P and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice P with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say P correctly in the word \"pony\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices P by saying \"pants\" while getting dressed, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say P\r\n~Tips on how to teach P to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online P flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying P\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on P for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying P!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

As far as I know, Unlimited ability to watch videos to get food/coins so you don't have to wait to advance your equipment. Hardly any forced-to-watch videos and I think those are only 5 seconds. Optional videos for upgrading items are 5 to 30 seconds. Most are nearer 30 but a surprising number 15 seconds or less.",
            "Love the controls, upgrades. I have played a ton of archery/shooter games and this is the only one I have stuck with. I love that you can switch between archer types(thrower, archer&wizard) the new \"craft\" feature is great! Makes it even more interesting cuz u can upgrade/improve all gear. I just wish it was easier to get craft material and I would like more items available for archers. Thanks and great work",

I feel that the player becomes more weak rather becoming more powerful as per the weapons that I purchase.. it looks like even after taking advanced weapon, the player is still weak as before.. as the number of enemies increases. .",
            "Here's the problem. 1)The loading between campain or character choice are far take Long to load. 2)Sometimes the arrow weapon or thrower weapon didn't hit the target even if it touch it,it just pass pass through the enemy. 3)After we die we can't use gems to revive ourself instead it came after 4 or 5 time we die in the campain or endless mode.4).Sometimes when we craft some javelin the damage decrease how? It cost 4000 to craft and the lvl and damage decrease.THE GAME IS FUN AND SPENT OUR DAY",
            "Pretty fun. One of the better phone games I've played. Not perfect from a fair, competitive standpoint, but that's not what they're trying to be. Kinda stupid for them to limit how much you can play the game with the \"supplies\" system, but whatever; it's their business."

            "I shot archery for real when I was young and my back was good. So far, this is my favourite app for archery. I like the shortness of the ads; you are not greedy! Also, the gameplay is easy and the targets are interesting. Oh, and a voice telling how many points you get from each arrow is nicely unusual. You guys are so good, can you maybe make a variant where we shoot only at a \"professional\" type target with a # of points needed for each stage? I never gave 5 stars before to anyone.",

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

            "The entire game is a \"pay to win\" nightmare... It is designed to artificially limit your progress in as many ways as you can think of. You cant upgrade your units without \"shards\" which are completely random. Worse, there is also an insultingly low \"daily gold limit.\" Gold is also required to make any upgrades. Worse, if you try to fight without leveling up, you will actually LOSE all of your hard earned progress. THE ONLY WAY TO WIN THIS GAME, IS TO NEVER PLAY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!",
            "Normally I don't like these types of games (auto battlers), but this is actually the first one that I've enjoyed. The game has quite a bit of strategy to it and oozes quality. The monetization system is questionable of course, it's pay-to-win and that is why I will not spend any money on it (I would happily have had the game as a premium title instead) and the game will get old quite fast for me because of that. But for now it is quite fun.",
            "Its a expensive game and you will not win if you never pay that why i notice. The winning rate will totally drop and you will done nothing once you stop spending. Gain no experience as well when loosing in the season pass. They will give just a star for wagon which will take 4 to 8 hours. You will enjoy playing at first but will loose interest in the long run",
            "Great game, I've been playing for a couple of months now without spending a cent. Quite playable without paying, although progess is slow after reaching certain level. Good variety of units but simple enough to relax and enjoy. Also you choose if you want to watch adds for resources. My only complaint is that, lacking resources, it is difficult to upgrade units, and therefore change strategies, once you are at a certian level. But overall a great game!",
            "Update fail. Game now crashes immediately after the 1st splash screen. Anyway it's just a cash grab. The now rampamt \"battle pass\" last barely a week & doesnt grant enogu to be worth buying even if it lasted a month or more like most others do. No real strategy, just whoever buys the most, wins & no real game as combat is entirely automated."

            "The bad; pin action is lacking and seem to be glued to floor. Wobbling pins rarely fall. The good; the ball action is quite good for the most part although speed control doesn't seem to be an option. Getting the ball to hook is a challenge as once released there is no control like other apps. It's very different from most apps in that everything is available from the start. The alleys and choice of balls ready to play. The music is different for all the alleys and mostly very nice listening.",
            "Reducing my rating front a 6 start to 2. Ads, the address have become nasty, obtrusive, annoying. I play this game far less nose than in the past because all the ads play sound and I found this out the first time in an environment where my phone should have been very quiet. What changed, greed in sure. This same shirt of thing is happening with all kinds of apps and it's really causing me to rethink what things I need and those I don't.",
            "Notice to all gamers if you want to play the games you have installed on your devices without having to be bothered by ads turn off your mobile data before you start the game and the game will play fine and the ads will not get through, no more ads ever. Its enough to have to pay for the use of the device we should not have to pay for the ads also, enough is ENOUGH!!!!!!",
            "Such a bad game because there's too many ads, when you aim left or right it goes the oppisite direction and the graphics are so bad in this game such a silly bowling game, other bowling games are way better than this one, Im uninstalling this game because it sucks👎👎👎",
            "Great game it's fun and time consuming but it would be better if you can add more colors to play with and more design and there is A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF ADS so it's awsome also you should add a computer mode with different difficultys it's a fun game I recommend it for everyone"

Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

People play games to get rid of boredom, but if the game they are playing gives them boredom they are more likely to delete it and find something else. [I know reviews for plants vs zombies-1 is outdated... still]",
            "The game itself deserves a 4.5. However..... there are way to many commercials. Especially during the middle of a game. There are many times during the same game that the only way you can complete a level is by using a booster. Every time you use a booster you have to watch a two part commercial. The game, ...... for now is entertaining enough to put up with the commercials, but eventually my frustration level will make me uninstall this game.",
            "Extremely nostalgic and I love the concept I've began to get addicted to it again <3 but I'd have to say the PC version was way better and sometimes it doesn't save my progress and I saw a review saying they lost all their progress so I'm about worried but other than that it's a 5 stars!! I honestly think the original is the best in my opinion :>",
            "Great game. Probably one of the best ones I played. Credit to PopCap for making this. Sadly EA felt like making a 30 second ad everytime you start a round, end a round, restart a round, enter the zen garden, exit the zen garden and the list goes on. EA is trying to shove in ads everywhere possible. Would give a 5/5 but EA wants more money than they already have so milking money out of people is something we all know EA for.",
            "I wish that the almanac section would be in the main menu. I wish the game would be a little bit faster, I guess? I hope that in the next update, there would be survial (hard) just like the original game in PC. And lastly I hope that if you finished all the achievements and/or levels of the game, you'll receive a gold trophy or something, just like in the original one. I hope you'll notice my complement. Despite that, i still love this game a lot.❤️"

I am not paying my monthly subscription until this is fixed on your side.",
            "Very nice app I don't know singing but this apps sound is loveable and just ossum sometimes the sound of the music helps to sing the next line .when somebody first time install the app the app gives the option of the duet with singer and with the actress ,it helps totally energetic anybody to sing the song .I a teen aged girl ,I love sing different types of songs ,I look for some thing that can help me to sing the song ,then I communicate with my friends and I know that this app is just ossum.",
            "5 stars, much better than Smule in my opinion! The people are so nice, and getting VIP here is so worth it! A bazillion songs to pick from, each one is amazing quality! Thank you for this awesome app! I will add, this app is hard to wrap your head around, but it took me about a day to figure it out.",
            "This app is indeed for singing but sometimes if we wanna sing the songs we like why do we need to become VIP. Can't we just sing without paying money. Coz to become VIP we need to pay. So sometimes it's very annoying. But this app is good too. I have nothing to say more but please remove the VIP system to select the song. It is so frustrating.",
            "I have no idea what happened.... The song lyrics have been cut like a lot... And usually there are a report button but I cant seem to find it at all and I believe that you take it out... So please please fix it... I love your app, i been using this app for long time already! Please do something about it"

            "It's good game dont get me wrong, it's a little pay to win but it's really fun once you get into the grind. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got cold heir out of a hite heroes with gems thing and I screen shot it to and left the app to show my friends but when I came back into the app I didnt have him. Can i get my cold heir back IGG?",
            "They make updates which make the game worse e.g when you evolved your hero you used to get a magical circle now it's some triangle trash. There's not much I can say apart from bring the old magic circles back. Also they hand out serveys for rewards but don't allow you to copy and paste your account code 4 some reason. Update this plz its a simple problem to solve.",
            "I really like this game,but sometimes i really always logging idk why im not full storage,i have 16GB and idk why this is happening in my cellphone but tnx qlot IGG games i still loving and playing this game but i dont like in this game i always loggong and quiting automatically,But i will always love this game but i will rate thia only 4 sorry IGG but i st8ll love your games..",
            "I love this game, but what the actual F. Lost connection? I spent 3 hours on a base design. 4 bars wifi. Perfect connection. All that base progress is gone. That's just absolutely stupid. Graphics/gameplay are great tho. But seriously fix the connection issue, cus it's really time consuming for me to waste my time on lost progress."

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: G is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say G and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice G with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say G correctly in the word \"gorilla\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices G by saying \"go\" while playing cars, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say G\r\n~Guide on how to teach G to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online G flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach G to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying G\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on G for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying G!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

            "Loved the game for a long time, for years.. Love the graphics and all. Compared to other racing games its way better. My issue is that eveything is all about money now, you gotta pay to advance. It wasn't the case before. There were some in game purchases before but nothing like it is now. What made it enjoyable, and what makes me want to always play, is that I may not purchase everything to get ahead. I just wish it was like it was before...",
            "I love the graphics and all the different modes that there are...really good game...tho I would put the multipling earnings with ads...that can give users the option of doubling the credits or the same amount of fusion coins... example: you got 1000 credits on a race...you get the option of multipling them, so you get 10,000(1,000x)...soo that we also have the option of instead of only double earning credits... Also fusion coins...buy we get the same amount we would get if it was normal credits.",
            "Very disappointed! I thought the latest update was the best update since they have included the high frame rate settings on my ASUS Max Pro M2. The game was very smooth at 60fps and I didn't encounter problems or glitches. But after I opened the game again the settings for high frame rate was gone. The cost of upgrades is already so expensive, at least give us a chance to enjoy the game @ 60fps.",
            "I don't think making a comment is going to change anything, but I will go ahead and vent a bit. This game is fun, but super expensive. Like, all the cars in S class cost tokens all of a sudden. What happened to plain old credits? Sure, the prices were exorbitant, but there was some silver of hope. With these ridiculous token prices, how are those of us who cannot/do not pay to play make any progress? And how does one even go about earning a decent amount of tokens? Honestly.",
            "Latest update reduces value of original currency to ZERO. You spend all this time earning it, now it's worth NOTHING. It has been replaced with a currency introduced a few updates ago. AVOID AT ALL COST!!! The game is decent. It's just Gameloft that SUCKS!!!! If Gameloft makes the game, find a different one. It will be better in the end!!"

Finally completed the last level. Took forever! Please add more levels! UPDATE: It's been a couple of months now since I finished the last level. Mind you, I don't know when the last level was actually completed by boom bit, but I keep getting updates for all of their games, but no new levels. Give us some new levels, man!",
            "The game is good, but very repetitive - just like the ads. You basically have to keep doing the same level over and over to earn enough coin to upgrade your car enough to pass that level. I paid to remove the ads as they were REALLY annoying. Even when you pay to remove the ads, you still get ads trying to get you to pay more money to unlock vehicles. I completed this game with the 2 cars that come by default within a few hours. Just waiting for new levels to be added. Not sure they will though.",
            "While my son I enjoyed playing the game, the ads can be a little bit ridiculous but I do understand it's a free game but still. I'm glad I didn't pay $299 for the no ads because there's not enough levels, with that said level 11 the vertical jump with the mountain yeah that can go to hell. I like a hard game but if I'm ready to throw the phone that's when I quit playing a game. only reason I will keep it is because my son likes playing it and he wants to unlock the rest of the free cars.",
            "Phenomenal Game but its very clear its unfinished. Level 11 is definitely meant to be a cash grab. Its 10 orders of magnitude more difficult than all the levels before it. Then level 12 is the final level. You can beat it over and over but the \"next level\" is always just the same level 12. Also, the ads are horrific!",
            "Heavy on ads, and level 11 designed to being in the revenue by being nearly impossible so you just watch a ton of ads or cough up the $$, but that doesn't solve how hard the level is. It also has some kind of memory leak that requires a hard close every so often. Otherwise it can generally be fun to play."
