Suggestion for the app developers: In the activities where the kids are teaching a new word, you should add a picture of the item in the corner of the screen while the kids say it. Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",

            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",

See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02708290. \r\n\r\n• Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises designed to last for 10 years\r\n\r\n• Used by over 1,000,000 children with language delay\r\n\r\n• Best Autism App on the Healthline’s list\r\n\r\n• Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Farsi, and Chinese.\r\n\r\nMental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with language delay and autism. MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n• Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.\r\n• Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.\r\n• Based on Pivotal Response Treatment that targets development of response to multiple cues. \r\n• Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time\r\n• Identify colors, patterns and sizes\r\n• Integrate objects into a unified picture\r\n• Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front\r\n• Time prepositions: Before/After\r\n• Passive verb tense\r\n• Subject / Object\r\n• Reading and Writing\r\n• Numbers and counting\r\n• Arithmetic\r\n• Logic and reasoning\r\n• Mental perspective taking\r\n• Mental mathematics\r\n• Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun\r\n• No Wi-Fi necessary\r\n• No ads\r\n\r\nMITA develops your child’s imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child's ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \r\nThe verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\r\nMITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. MITA exercises can be used by children with language delay, ASD, PDD, intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), Down syndrome, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as a supplement to conventional speech therapy.\r\n\r\nMITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J.

This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0002). See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04108290.  <br><br>• Adds 15 New Games. <br><br>• Activities organized into 50+ games.  ",
        "comments": [
            "Very good game! Thus, for language it is important 1. To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered. I have to change a level back manually at each session, because I am sure that my child does not remember a name of an object, but got the program algoryth using visual clues.",
            "My child using it for 10 months and his improvement is really grate. Very useful app for autistic child like my son.",
            "My 3 year loves using this app. It has definitely helped us.",
            "It helps my 6 year old. Great app.. 👍After a few months of use, the challenge is keeping him interested as he now rejects doing this... For variety, can pictures change? Like plants? Thanks..",
            "4 stars as a start. As the parent of a Autistic child, your \"app\" is challenging, easy to comprehend by the child, fast, with continuous flow of activities per letters.. THANKS, for this DEVZ. More power to you, & GOD bless you!!"

            "I like the app a lot since I'm a speech therapist my self. But there's only one downside. I made the donation and got full access, but after I record my voice when I play it back it sounds like cracking, breaking.... it's not a good recording feature. Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",
            "Most stupid app ever seen. This app doesn't deserve one star. Its a waste of time and data. After downloading 47mb, it still want me to connect to internet before it works. Even with the internet connection it keeps saying cannot connect to the server.",
            "Nice app. Paid the subscription for the full version and found it easy enough to record audio and pictures. Big issue though is that it needs internet access to open the app. Big turn off not being able to use the app at all in offline mode. If this was fixed would consider reinstalling and updating the score.",
            "This helps my son learn to say words by attaching a picture and hearing it say that word. I had trouble getting it to work at first, but after contacting the developer, they helped me fix that problem. Thanks!",
            "Since I've shown my son this app, he opens the app and goes through the menu and attempts repeats the words by himself, without me having to sit and practice with him. Really easy for him to use."

The only messages that I got were from fake prostitutes. Yes, you read that right - fake prostitutes not even real ones. They pretended to be in my city but knew nothing about it and wanted me to wire them money. Sure...",

Amazing 1 best thing: I forget my passwords and asked Customer Service, just a few minutes received a reply, told me how to reset it. Very happy addressed this issue. I would recommend this app to family and friends as it is really good",

            "I'm too old to figure this out.... Need something that lets me use the keyboard to type and then read that out loud. Maybe have a library of phrase I've input.... Communication outside of my computer is too tedious no matter what.",
            "This app has been a life-saver; we use it to support our communications with our child on the autistic spectrum. The app in itself has to be personalized, and it is NOT easy.. It is time-consuming to get the personalized images (although they have an extensive generic image bank) up, as well as the pronunciation you wish on specific names or words. And, it is nearly impossible to transfer a profile between android devices. Yes, the app could be better, and it is a shame there is no more technical support offered for it, but I am giving it five stars because it is free, and it has been a massive help to us. Thanks!",
            "I found this yesterday and have been playing around with it-I have 18 years experience working for children who have execptionalities. This is a wonderful app for anybody who may need a voice at times but do not have professional supports in place yet. My son has found it easy to navigate and loves that I was able to personalize the labels. The only issue I've had so far pertains to rearranging the pictures, they didn't stay where I put them.",
            "Trying numerous augmented communication apps for my daughter and this one was the closest to what she use to have on the ipad when the device died. Awesome app. Very easy to set up, a lot of setting options to customize for the needs of the individual and it does not matter how long she pushes the button, it will say the word. Speech can be a little odd but this app gives you the ability to use other voice apps to change the sound. After trying quite a few, this is the one which fit all my needs. Will be donating money to the developer as soon as I can. Great job and thank you so very much!"

The motion method detects small movements from you just holding the device. Waving over the proximity sensor is another method that optionally extends the timeout. The tilt angle method allows the display to stay on when propped up, even when you aren't holding it. You can also choose to have the display stay on while using certain apps, while charging, or while on a call (display still turns off when you put the phone to your ear).\r\n \r\nTime screen out quickly to save battery\r\nYou can choose the screen timeout when no keep-on rules are actively keeping the screen on. If the screen isn't being kept on, it should time out quickly to save power. The timeout can be even shorter when the proximity sensor is covered (in-pocket or face down). You can also set a separate timeout for the lockscreen.\r\n \r\nMore information\r\nThe settings are highly customizable to your taste. Fine-tuning of parameters is locked in the free version. Please upgrade to premium to fully unlock these features and support future development! KinScreen is continually being improved based on user feedback and feature requests.\r\n  \r\nKinScreen is designed to be as efficient and battery friendly as possible. It uses little CPU and RAM, and sensor use is highly optimized. However, the proximity sensor may use considerable power on some devices.\r\n \r\nKinScreen will not interfere with any other apps that already keep the screen on since it never actively turns it off.\r\n \r\nThe status bar icon changes based on if KinScreen is keeping the screen on, timing out, or timing out more quickly due to proximity. Inside the app, the colored statuses at the top give you even more insight into what KinScreen is doing. A green status is keeping the screen on, a red status is timing the screen out, and a yellow status would be keeping the screen on but there is another rule preventing it.\r\n \r\nTo calibrate motion sensitivity, please set the device on a very stable surface, tap calibrate and wait 10 seconds for KinScreen to automatically fine tune the motion sensitivity for your device.",

            "I have a Samsung Note 8, and its screen settings limit 10 minutes of inactivity maximum. That makes it difficult and frustrating when I'm gaming with an emulator and gamepad. Kinscreen is fantastic because it will leave my screen on all day while I'm gaming or just dont want to constantly unlock it with my password. Settings allow for it to not turn off in certain situations or use a manual toggle to just stay on all day. It also shows the angle the phone is at with a motion sensor. Excellent!",
            "It's perfect for my wallet case: closed - screen off, open - screen on, with great control settings. I'd used another app for years, but lost a few features when I recently upgraded my phone. After using KinScreen for about a week, it's done everything I was hoping it would. I just tweaked a couple of settings (after realizing how I wanted it to work) and I'm very impressed. Thanks, guys!",
            "Update: I did follow the advice of TEQTIC and it is working like a charm now. Thanks! I've tried many similar apps but Kinscreen beats them all. The only problem I'm experiencing now is that randomly the app stops working. The app is 'on' but doesn't what it is supposed to do and the icon in the notification bar is gone. Once I open the app it works fine for 1 or 2 days. This is since a day or 5. Could it have something to do with Android 10 which I downloaded a week ago? Something in settings?",
            "I love KinScreen. On my Moto Z it works great. On my Moto G8 it won't let me set the screen display time in settings. It keeps changing it to 10 seconds. Both phones have the same KinScreen settings. I don't want the display turning off that fast. Teqtic do you know what's up?",
            "Perfect replacement for old Screebl app ehich is no longer supported and no longer working on new devices. All that I needed is covered by this app and after writing to dev team with new suggestions they seem open to new ideas which is refreshing. Worth every penny so far."

Also, and this has happened more than 3 times, it would say I still have to hit a few more cans but there are no cans left to hit. Please fix this. It's very frustrating esp for the harder levels when you're so close to winning.",
            "There are alot of ads running and is very pathetic.. Its like not playing the game but watching the ads.. As i have downloaded it just to watch the ads. Not Worst but it is more then that..",

To date, thousands of users have completed over 110 million exercises using Constant Therapy. \r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n\r\n•        Practice speech, language, cognition, memory, reading, attention and comprehension skills anytime, anywhere\r\n•        Choose your recovery goals and we’ll deliver personalized tasks to help you get there\r\n•        See your progress in real time on your performance dashboard\r\n•        Access a library of evidence-based exercises developed by neuroscientists and clinicians \r\n•        Get the most out of Constant Therapy with one-on-one help from Customer Support specialists \r\n•        Try before you subscribe with a 2-week free trial\r\n•        Pair the app with cognitive and speech therapy you’re already doing in the clinic (even add your clinician so they can monitor your progress)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Science Behind Constant Therapy:\r\n\r\nConstant Therapy was designed by scientists at Boston University, and has won awards from the American Stroke Association and AARP. The clinically-proven app is recommended by speech language pathologists, neurologists and occupational therapists.\r\n\r\nIn a recent study of post-stroke rehabilitation practices published in Frontiers in Neurology, outcomes were compared among 3,686 patients who used tablet-based therapy at home independently and those who completed the same therapy in a clinic under the guidance of a clinician. The study found tablet-based home users mastered skills in a shorter time and practiced therapy more frequently than clinic users.

            "Problems for people with dimentia or Alzheimers... It is NOT appropriate to ask them how well they are remembering things, understanding things, etc.as this app does with the user. Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

Button Mapper does not work when the screen is off unless your device is rooted or you run an adb command.<br><br>A few examples of remapping you can do with Button Mapper:<br>-long press to toggle your flashlight<br>-remap your TV remote control<br>-press to broadcast custom intents, scripts or commands<br>-long press to open camera and take a photo<br>-double tap to launch your favorite app or shortcut<br>-double tap to open your notifications<br>-swap your back and recent apps keys (capacitive buttons only!)<br>-use your volume buttons to adjust screen brightness<br>-long press to toggle &quot;do not disturb&quot; mode<br>-and much more<br><br>Additional features unlocked in the pro version: <br>-Simulate keycodes (requires adb command or root)<br>-Swap volume keys on orientation change<br>-Default to ring volume on Pie or later<br>-Pocket detection<br>-Themes<br>-Change back and recents buttons<br>-Customization of haptic feedback (vibration) on button press and long press<br><br>Actions that can be mapped to buttons or keys:<br>-Launch any app or shortcut<br>-Disable the button<br>-Broadcast intents (PRO)<br>-Run scripts (PRO)<br>-Camera shutter<br>-Turn screen off<br>-Toggle flashlight<br>-Quick settings<br>-Show notifications<br>-Power dialog<br>-Take screenshot<br>-Music: previous/next track and play/pause<br>-Adjust volume or mute<br>-Last app switch<br>-Toggle do not disturb<br>-Adjust brightness<br>-Now on tap (root)<br>-Menu button (root)<br>-Choose custom keycode (root and PRO)<br>-Root command (root and PRO)<br>-Toggle WiFi<br>-Toggle Bluetooth<br>-Toggle rotation<br>-Clear notifications<br>-Split screen<br>-Scroll up/down (root)<br>-And many more...<br><br>Buttons supported:<br>-Physical home, back and recent apps/menu buttons<br>-Volume up<br>-Volume down<br>-Most camera buttons<br>-Many headset buttons<br>-Custom buttons: add other buttons (active, mute, etc) on your phone, headphones, gamepads, TV remote and other peripheral devices<br><br>Additional options:<br>-change the long press or double tap duration<br>-delay initial button press for better double tap operation<br>-disable Button Mapper while using specific apps<br>-plus many more customizations<br><br>Troubleshooting:<br>-Make sure Button Mapper accessibility service is enabled and allowed to run in the background<br>-Button Mapper does not work with onscreen buttons (such as soft keys or the navigation bar) or the power button. <br>-The options shown in the app depend on the buttons available on your phone. Not all phones have home, back and recents buttons!<br><br>This app uses Accessibility services. Accessibility is used to detect when the physical or capacitive buttons are pressed on your device so they can be remapped to custom actions to accommodate your needs. It is not used to see what you type. Button Mapper does not collect or share any of your personal information, it is safe and your privacy is respected.<br><br>This app uses the Device Administrator permission. (BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN)<br>This permission is used to lock the screen if the &quot;Turn screen off&quot; action is chosen. If you want to remove this permission, open Button Mapper, click on the menu (three dots in the upper right corner) and select &quot;Uninstall&quot;",

            "This app is AWESOME! That's coming from a software engineer. Usability and functionality are top notch. It can even turn off my stupid glowing hardware buttons, which is a must. I don't understand complaining about the $5 premium upgrade which allows you to modify the back and home buttons (precisely why I downloaded the app). How dare someone try to get paid for their hard work? 😒 You probably spend more on a single coffee. That said, I wasn't expecting it going in, and that may be the issue.",
            "Okay, I almost NEVER rate apps, but this one actually worked! It was a bit of a pain to hook it up to a PC and connect, debug, etc, but no other app actually disabled that annoying Bixby button. All others let it pop up over other screens, then you could close it, this one kills the button. DEAD! Exactly what I was looking for as every time I mounted the phone in a gimbal, selfie stick, tripod holder, ETC.that frickin Bixby would pop up and start yakking. Now she's SHUT UP for good! LOL.",
            "It actually works. This app does what it says. This made my water damaged Samsung A5 usable again!! After my phone got wet the back button constantly triggered. With this program I turned off the regular press of the back button and re-mapped the \"long press\" and I can use my phone almost exactly as before. I happily paid the for the app. A few $100 saved overall...!",
            "Works great to remap the keys of the new Google TV Chromecast Remote Control. The Youtube and Netflix button can now easily be mapped to different applications and with the single, double and long press options, you can map 3 options (including Youtube and Netflix) to those 2 buttons. Great app. Took 1 minute to figure it out.",
            "very cool app! works great on my Philips TV to remap the Rakuten key to Disney and YouTube (long press) can't get the broadcast intent to work to switch to HDMI 1 when I press the TV key though :-( I know the correct adb command, but it won't work... the %2F is translated to / in the Button Mapper interface adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d content://android.media.tv/passthrough/com.mediatek.tvinput%2F.hdmi.HDMIInputService%2FHW5"

            "I'm maybe at an A2 level in German. I have studied the basics with a professor and with other apps. I find exercising with this app hard as I have never heard some of the expressions from the 3-rd lesson and the app provides no grammar or explanations on why a certain phrase is built in such a way. You can't even ask some community member. This can't be useful to build a solid foundation and then build on it. The free Duolingo app feels much better than this. Not to mention the premium Busuu.",
            "It is great but in korean it is not letting me do anything it freezes when I want to start then my phone turns off and I turn it back on and the screen is a dark dark blue I really love this app and heard really good reviews but I just need help in this situation.",
            "Latest update has meant I can't login, the fields requiring you to enter password won't allow the keyboard to appear, therefore only a one star ⭐ as I can't access my courses",
            "I am not even able to login into the app, the app doesn't allow me to write my login details as the keyboard doesn't even open",
            "For right now it's 2, I can't login to my account, the keyboard will not pull up. Let's me select the email but that's it. Hopefully this will be a priority fix"

Babies and children will learn to:\r\n\r\n- Identify shapes and colors.\r\n- Process spatial relation: orientation, size and position.\r\n- Associate silhouettes and elements.\r\n- Improve visual acuity searching objects.\r\n- Develop manual dexterity and motor skills.\r\n- Detect and classify intruders within a list of elements.\r\n- Differentiate figures and backgrounds.\r\n- Enhance their attention span and concentration.\r\n- Boost observation skills and difference perception.\r\n\r\nKids Play Visual Games are carefully designed with a simple interface in order to make children have fun while learning with animals and kid-friendly characters.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT DIFFICULTY LEVELS\r\nOur goal is that, whatever the intellectual capacity of the child may be, they can sharpen their visual acuity gradually. To do that, the game offers three difficulty levels (easy, medium and difficult), adapted to different ages and stages of development.\r\n\r\nEasy: Ideal for beginners, especially for babies and kids at an early age.\r\nMedium: Perfect for those children who are already familiar with the game.\r\nDifficult: Suitable for kids who have managed to solve each game quickly and don’t need supervision of parents or teachers to solve them.\r\n\r\nEDUJOY EDUCATIONAL GAMES \r\nThis app is part of an educational games collection created by Edujoy in order to help kids to develop new intellectual and motor skills from elements of their environment.\r\n\r\nAll our games are created by professional educators and psychologists in order to provide pedagogical content, necessary for the intellectual development of babies and children.\r\n\r\nWe love creating educational and fun games for you.

They just love to hear the sounds and if you have a ball or a duck or something like that to holdup that they can reach this touching helps them to crawl. It helps them to identify sounds and object even if they dont speak yet they will point or grap a ball if you say where is the ball. Very useful.",

I guess it's just another instance of the ubiquitous faceless Corp caring nothing about the lowly consumer. *sigh*"

You knock down cans in entertaining, puzzle, strategy fashion. For what it is, its nothing less than perfection.",

            "I appreciate developers for this app. But I have noticed the battery optimization in battery settings in my Android is sufficient to save the battery. It even warns me if any app is consuming the battery so I can then force stop if required. There is no any need to use other battery saving app (at least in my Android). This app might be useful to save RAM, but my Android also handles this fluently ☺️.",
            "This app is the only one that I've found that perfectly force stops the apps. Then as it exists it force stops itself. If you go into settings you see that it all worked. Crazy an app actually does what it says it will do with no bs. This app deserves more then 5 stars. It literally saves me massive amounts of time doing this manually.",
            "Great App. It force closes every app running on my phone. I didn't realize how many apps run in background with my knowledge. Helps not drain my battery and helps phone run faster. Only complaint I have is that when it is force closing all my apps it ALWAYS (every single time) gets hung up on Amazon Apps. Sometimes I have to force close the app and run it again. I do like after it runs full list of apps it is force closing, it force closes itself!",
            "Works great for closing apps that it actually lists. Unfortunately it does not scan/list many many apps that are installed. It stops manually downloaded apps, and you can set \"System apps\", but it totally ignores preinstalled apps. There's prolly 30 apps on my phone that this app won't pick up. Still, this is THE best no-root force stopper.",
            "Does what it says and that's it. BRILL! Just be careful what you close down. It can close down services that allow the Android wear to communicate with your devices. But does what it says efficiently, and even revokes it's app permission that you have to set to automate the process, which is a nice help to strengthen your privacy."

The cloud backup option is not available, which is just frustrating in case of accidental breakage of your smartphone. I have request with the developer that please atleast provide this function or you can give us option to backup the contents by making them ZIP file. It will be a great help then.",
            "when I first got this app a year ago I was really glad that it worked so well. it never lagged, it operated smoothly, and it didn't have ads. however, after almost two years, this app has changed drastically. to start, it lags a lot. I press a button and it won't show up with options for a few minutes, making it difficult for me to get drafts done. the app also doesn't operate as smoothly due to the lagging. I hope this is fixed in future updates.",
            "This is an amazing apps for authors who want to look for a simplified UI. However, I do wanna point out the problems with an external keyboard. When I connect a physical keyboard, the blinking cursor would not appear, unlike when you use your Android keyboard. It can get annoying sometimes, as you would have no idea where you're typing, and it's just that you get used to have a blinking cursor while typing, it feels off. 9/10 for design, -1 for the bugs. Really great and user friendly.",
            "I've been using this app for several years and it's easy to use. No complaints at all. Saves automatically when you close it. My only wish for it would be to make it easier to back it all up regularly. But taking the extra time to convert each piece of writing and so it that way is nothing to villain about for a free app without ads",
            "Quite user-friendly, useful and space saving app for writing. Was mistaken, write to SD card is supported. But how come no upgrade version after such a long while? The developer did a great job, without any doubts. Unfortunately, couldn't find the companion app, Writer Sync for storage on Google Drive any more. Why? Please update app and integrate the sync to Google Drive feature. Thank you."

            "This is a fantastic app for helping you step down a day by day basis. I have cut down from 30 a day 15 already! The only things that I think would make it better is the ability to share the progress chart and maybe the choice of a widgit or notification option to alert you when you can have your next cig according to the programme. I have noticed a few times that I look and see I have another 20 minutes to go but then I'm trying not to clock watch as I get stressed out that way. Thank you!!",
            "Very useful. Helps to control how many cigaretes you smoke at the start. I hope it will help me to quit as well. Notifications works fine for me .You just have to go to settings and change the sound from silence to any sound you want. 5 star because is simple and easy",
            "it's the best anti smoking app i've seen, i downloaded a bunch of others but they all work the same way, by cutting out smoking completely and giving you achievements and stats on how well youre doing, anyone who has tried to quit can tell you this doesnt work. this app reduces the times you smoke gradually making it so much more easy",
            "It is an amazing application that is making me reduce smoking but there is one issue i cannot change the notification tone, i am changing the tone but it still uses the default tone i don't know what to do.",
            "The app itself is helpful. Not pushy or accidentally judgemental like the other quit smoking apps. But the biggest problems are 1) notifications don't seem to work and 2) The super awesome widget (my fav feature) is useless because it doesn't update unless you go into the app, and sometimes not even then. Which kind of makes the widget useless."

            "My daughter likes this app so I paid to have the ads removed as they are full screen ads which can be clicked on very easily. The ads are not baby friendly. Then there is the fact that the app automatically adjusts the volume when it is launched. It's way too loud.",
            "THIS APP IS A SCAM! Ads are put into game play because children will click on them unknowingly and clock up revenue. You cannot use this app in its current condition, save your child and yourself the frustration and don't fall for this scam.",

            "one of the best games! it has an awesome yet sad story, and it sometimes makes you rage. the game is from 2015, so what would you expect from the graphics? its good enough. SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! in the last room, Lumi (cats name) says \"why did i create this?\" and \"why did i lock myself in here?\" this is why the cat is the owner herself.",
            "Contrary to the third quote of world 3 room 1, This game is amazing! The physics work perfectly and the levels are fun. It's creative with all the mechanics and as a bonus: It's cute! My only problem is that there could be more of a story, But besides that, This game is 11/10 and I can't wait to finish it and play the sequel. Edit: after playing and finishing the sequel, I can safely say that this game is easier, but more enjoyable than Cats are Liquid 2. Still they are both amazing!",
            "It's vary simple and easy to use. I also find it dosnt stress me as much as most games too so it's good as a relaxing game. I really sogest it and it's likely you'll enjoy it. The only downside is that some of the movements are a bit slow but that can also help you. It also is simple but looks really good.",
            "I love this. Quite possibly the best mobile game I've ever played. It's fairly easy most of the time, but I would argue this works very much in it's favor-- the gameplay is very calming, with very fluid and free movement. The story fits well with the atmosphere, and is surprisingly engaging. A lot of what exactly happened is left up to interpretation. But my favorite thing about it is the hidden appearances of purple cat, and I really wish there were more little things like that.",
            "This is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. In all the hundreds of apps I have reviewed, this is the 1st to get 5 stars. The story is good, it looks good, everything is very smooth, controls are easy. I finished the game in a day because I wouldn't leave my computer. [I have to finish all of the games to review them.] Please get this game, the developers deserve a good pat on the back. I love this game and will be reviewing the 2nd one soon, yes, I like it that much! -TheReviewee"

Loving that! I'm not far into it and I like it alot already. But unless I havnt gotten far enough, (lvl 15), I'm hoping there is some kind of Boss battle maybe or a Bonus Round?

It is best for children ages 4, 5, 6 and 7 years old.\r\n\r\nEach of the tasks presents a sequence of pictures on the screen that together tell a story, yet the pictures get mixed at the start of the round. The child has to put the pictures back into the correct order and tell the story these pictures display. The game effectively trains the ability to speak in complete and meaningful sentences as well as to come to logical conclusions based on observed facts. To place the pictures in the correct order, children need to first establish causal, temporal, spatial and other logic relationships between the smaller pieces and demonstrate a rather high level of abstraction. Examining pictures itself trains attention and concentration.\r\n\r\nAsk your kid to tell a short story or in some way explain why the pictures should be in that order as well as what happens on the pictures. Each story has a beginning, then some development, and finally an ending. All the pictures are realistic, colorful, and aimed at young kids.\r\n\r\nThe game offers tasks with 3 levels of difficulty:\r\n1. Easy - sequences of 4 easy pictures (for example, 1. whole apple, 2. bitten apple, 3. half-eaten apple, 4. apple core)\r\n2. Medium - sequences of 4 pictures which together make a small story with a simple plot\r\n3.

The graphics are engaging and clear, and the main sounds are charming. My only quibble is that the selection area for items in the back two rows is too small (or the front item selection area is too big). If you touch the plate/base of an item in the back rows, the game can mis-read your selection.",

Great to have this app on my phone to quickly identify the reason for connectivity concerns. And of course my LTE+ delivers the fallback connection if it's ever an ISP problem.",
            "Good, but could be better if you add a quick country switch or an option to set specific websites to global instead. For example, yesterday there was a global Twitter outage, but my country just gave a 1000 reports of this, while the US gave 100.000 reports.",

I'm glad I used some free Google play credit for the subscription to get notification when a site is having issues because the two sites that I'm adding have had issues but I'm not getting a notification. And of course it's too late to get my money back for the subscription because they only give you like 3 hours to test the app. Well I can get pretty good idea if an app/site is down Don't waste your money.",

Others very clearly are remixed classical songs with a creepy af spin on them. Other than all that, very repetitive, plays maybe 8-12 songs tops. UI is ok, it's colorful, buttons w no explanation, click to find out their use. It never crashed & always started right up. Unimpressed. Uninstalled.",

            "Double down casino you should look at fixing all your bugs. You can barely get to a game, with it's sluggish multi screen information, and alerts. Then when you get to a slot after waiting far too for it to download, it stops after a minute or two of playing, and I've lost points because of it. They have the best real slots, but their technical Dept isn't doing a great job with maintenance.",
            "I love this app...but I don't care if I ever have to see Rolling in more Gold or Mammuth cash the ages orTriple fortune Dragon. I hate those games and never can win with them. I enjoy the Challenge games, but really...using over 2 or 3 million chips to ultimately win the last challenge of only about 5000 chips. When I see that challenge, I don't even want to try it , and more often or not, don't bother. Thank you for letting me vent.",
            "Used to be my favourite game on my phone, but a few years ago they took tournaments off, and said it was just a temporary thing and they had to fix some things on it. That was when it went down hill.. they have never added tournaments back on since, you can't add other players anymore (used to be able to click on players profiles but that doesn't work anymore) so the \"friends\" part of the daily spin stays at 0. And to even get a decent payback on spins you have to bet at least 40k or above.",
            "The bonus rounds consistently freeze and disable play. The only way to continue playing is by exiting and re-entering the app. I have been very disappointed in the maintenance of this app. More slots have been loaded, but this seems to be negatively impacting the app performance.",
            "Double Down is really fun for about the first 2 weeks or so when they actually allow you to win on a fairly regular basis. After the first 2 weeks (or until you get to level 9) you will never do any good again. they want to keep you out of chips in hopes that you will purchase more chips with your hard earned money. This game is not random even tho the app makers will respond to this review with their standard response about \"every player's experience is different and all spins are random\"."

        "comments": [
            "Love the app, and the show. I have to pause videos to let them load, but other than that it's great. My daughter is 2 1/2 and she sings \"grown ups come back\" all the time. I babysat a kid of the same age, and when he cried for his dad my little one sang to him to help him feel better. Only thing missing from the app is a song about what to do when you can't have your way..I saw the show and loved it, wish it were on here. Also there needs to be a show about being tired/grumpy and how naps help!",
            "This is the best app besides the PBS video app. My kid's are NOT extra whiny because of daniel (like a previous review said) they have been watching for years. They have learned so many great lessons from Daniel Tiger, I love that he teaches patience, sharing and how to be gentle and play nice with the baby. It helps my 3 and 4 yr olds to play different with their 1 yr old brother and with the new baby that's coming. Thank you PBS.",
            "App functionality great- DT HORRIBLE!! do not reccomend! my child never watching again! Your own child will become a whiny little selfish brat! He throws tantrums and teaches u to stomp your feet and mom tiger doesn't let daniel b independent!Makes him change how he n his friends play so a baby can play too! And the\"take turn\"lesson is the worst!If kid playing with a toy y should they give it up after only 5 min of play?!not teaching patience and waiting turns at all! Horrific life lessons!!",
            "UPDATE: the issue in question appears to have been resolved as of 12/13/18. My kids were THRILLED to have the \"make believe\" portion back. We use this app every day for dealing with feelings and daily routines. Highly recommend! I have loved this app and use it regularly with my 2 and 4 year olds. They love it too. Recently though the \"related videos\" portion of the app has stopped working and leads to a lot of frustration from my kiddos. I've updated, restarted, and even uninstalled and re installed the app. I emailed the developer, but did not hear back. If it gets fixed, this is a 5 star app.",
            "Used to love playing this for my son. Now most of the videos wont play and display a black screen. Only a few random ones and its difficult just trying to figure out which ones. Our favorite bedtime routine does not play anymore. I tried redownloading and that didnt fix the problem."

I asked to my sis(Who play this game)she said\"No\"So I am also going to download it because of the color activity because I can draw beautiful,And I really like this game I recommend this game to all speacially kids because this game is for kids but other like adults, young,old",
            "Intrusive ads in a kids drawing app. Ridiculous.",
            "My daughter kept hitting their stupid advertising plug and was constantly being kicked from the game. The multi touch for the dragging the shapes around is garbage also. She knew where the shapes needed to go but it kept giving her the error noise",

I decided to download this app so I know which colour is which and oh my goodness if this isn't the BEST app I've ever downloaded i don't know what is. I recommend this to everyone of all ages. P.s. you are never too old to learn!"

            "So I needed some fancy text/ cool symbols, the first time i didnt use the faces ,i used the symbols, it was perfect and today i wanted use faces but it needs money! Thats a rip off if you ask me. Like its only text, you can literaly help a homeless person with a snack and water and you expect me to waste over 1 quid on and digital face?? All im saying is that it should be free, not charged, and i know you need money but ripping of people is stupid. Please reply or change the amount of money.",

The graphics are engaging and clear, and the main sounds are charming. My only quibble is that the selection area for items in the back two rows is too small (or the front item selection area is too big). If you touch the plate/base of an item in the back rows, the game can mis-read your selection.",

Great to have this app on my phone to quickly identify the reason for connectivity concerns. And of course my LTE+ delivers the fallback connection if it's ever an ISP problem.",
            "Good, but could be better if you add a quick country switch or an option to set specific websites to global instead. For example, yesterday there was a global Twitter outage, but my country just gave a 1000 reports of this, while the US gave 100.000 reports.",
            "Love the info provided! Definitely a must for gamers to report and see what's going on within their networks 😊",
            "Good for checking sites but the notification subscription doesn't work. I'm glad I used some free Google play credit for the subscription to get notification when a site is having issues because the two sites that I'm adding have had issues but I'm not getting a notification. And of course it's too late to get my money back for the subscription because they only give you like 3 hours to test the app. Well I can get pretty good idea if an app/site is down Don't waste your money.",

            "Double down casino you should look at fixing all your bugs. You can barely get to a game, with it's sluggish multi screen information, and alerts. Then when you get to a slot after waiting far too for it to download, it stops after a minute or two of playing, and I've lost points because of it. They have the best real slots, but their technical Dept isn't doing a great job with maintenance.",
            "I love this app...but I don't care if I ever have to see Rolling in more Gold or Mammuth cash the ages orTriple fortune Dragon. I hate those games and never can win with them. I enjoy the Challenge games, but really...using over 2 or 3 million chips to ultimately win the last challenge of only about 5000 chips. When I see that challenge, I don't even want to try it , and more often or not, don't bother. Thank you for letting me vent.",
            "Used to be my favourite game on my phone, but a few years ago they took tournaments off, and said it was just a temporary thing and they had to fix some things on it. That was when it went down hill.. they have never added tournaments back on since, you can't add other players anymore (used to be able to click on players profiles but that doesn't work anymore) so the \"friends\" part of the daily spin stays at 0. And to even get a decent payback on spins you have to bet at least 40k or above.",
            "The bonus rounds consistently freeze and disable play. The only way to continue playing is by exiting and re-entering the app. I have been very disappointed in the maintenance of this app. More slots have been loaded, but this seems to be negatively impacting the app performance.",
            "Double Down is really fun for about the first 2 weeks or so when they actually allow you to win on a fairly regular basis. After the first 2 weeks (or until you get to level 9) you will never do any good again. they want to keep you out of chips in hopes that you will purchase more chips with your hard earned money. This game is not random even tho the app makers will respond to this review with their standard response about \"every player's experience is different and all spins are random\"."

            "Love the app, and the show. I have to pause videos to let them load, but other than that it's great. My daughter is 2 1/2 and she sings \"grown ups come back\" all the time. I babysat a kid of the same age, and when he cried for his dad my little one sang to him to help him feel better. Only thing missing from the app is a song about what to do when you can't have your way..I saw the show and loved it, wish it were on here. Also there needs to be a show about being tired/grumpy and how naps help!",
            "This is the best app besides the PBS video app. My kid's are NOT extra whiny because of daniel (like a previous review said) they have been watching for years. They have learned so many great lessons from Daniel Tiger, I love that he teaches patience, sharing and how to be gentle and play nice with the baby. It helps my 3 and 4 yr olds to play different with their 1 yr old brother and with the new baby that's coming. Thank you PBS.",
            "App functionality great- DT HORRIBLE!! do not reccomend! my child never watching again! Your own child will become a whiny little selfish brat! He throws tantrums and teaches u to stomp your feet and mom tiger doesn't let daniel b independent!Makes him change how he n his friends play so a baby can play too! And the\"take turn\"lesson is the worst!If kid playing with a toy y should they give it up after only 5 min of play?!not teaching patience and waiting turns at all! Horrific life lessons!!",
            "UPDATE: the issue in question appears to have been resolved as of 12/13/18. My kids were THRILLED to have the \"make believe\" portion back. We use this app every day for dealing with feelings and daily routines. Highly recommend! I have loved this app and use it regularly with my 2 and 4 year olds. They love it too. Recently though the \"related videos\" portion of the app has stopped working and leads to a lot of frustration from my kiddos. I've updated, restarted, and even uninstalled and re installed the app. I emailed the developer, but did not hear back. If it gets fixed, this is a 5 star app.",
            "Used to love playing this for my son. Now most of the videos wont play and display a black screen. Only a few random ones and its difficult just trying to figure out which ones. Our favorite bedtime routine does not play anymore. I tried redownloading and that didnt fix the problem."

            "I absolutely love this app. It is beyond any other \"so called\" educational app. This is so intuitive and really engages my kids. I have a child with exceptionalities as well and she is able to navigate, understand and learn the concepts. I love how the content is tailored to the age of the child. My son is able to learn more advance subjects by changing the age. The best part is that there are ABSOLUTELY NO ADS and it is free!!! I highly recommend this to all parents.",
            "I am absolutely in LOVE with this app! It has the best learning material and no ads. Perfect!! I was looking for something educational for my 7 and 4 year old, and this is the only one I will ever use for them. It's perfect. Seriously deleting all other learning apps and games because this is the only one they will ever need. I can't believe it's completely free and no ads. Thank you so much for making this amazing app free for my children and helping them learn. I am so greatful!!!",
            "My little niece loves it! Everything is VERY clear, easy to understand, fun and really helps keep their attn while learning! NO ADS and NEVER boring!! Can't believe this is a FREE APP!!! KAK doesn't give kids the answers, they have to actually figure things out (and learn), which is wonderful! The fun (sometimes silly) songs and educational stories are great!! There's constant positive reinforcement, throughout. If they get an answer wrong, they're encouraged to keep trying. EXCELLENT APP 👌!!",
            "We love this app! It's one of my son's favorite things to do on his new tablet. He calls it his \"learning\". I do wish you could track progress through the regular Khan Academy (as he has an account there), and there's definitely a need for more to do offline. We like to use this in the car or while we are out for very long periods of time, but he is getting bored with the small bits he can do offline. Otherwise, this is a really great app, overall.",
            "Picky 4 and 6 year old enjoyed the challenges. Most of the time, I have to remind them to try the apps but not this one—they voluntarily uses it. The user interface of the app of a thumbs up too. It's easier for parents to find a subject and see which topics from their list hasn't been opened yet because it shows a check sign once you're done with a certain topic."

        "description": "Do you feel like you're always stressed, anxious, sad, frustrated, or unmotivated? The centerpiece of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to identify negative and distorted thinking patterns to change your emotions and your behaviors for the better. In CBT, a \"thought record\" guides you through the steps of identifying, challenging, and reinterpreting negative thinking patterns. With Thought Diary, you can document your negative emotions, analyze flaws in your thinking, and re-evaluate your negative thoughts into more balanced ones. It may even help you recognize helpful ways to deal with your negative behaviors and emotions for future situations.\r\n\r\nCBT Thought Diary can do more than thought records, though! It can also be used as a daily mood tracker. You can even practice gratitude by creating positive entries using our flexible diary entry format. According to positive psychology, appreciating the positives in our lives can improve happiness and meaning.\r\n \r\nWith CBT Thought Diary, you can gradually change your approach to how you interpret the ups and downs of life, making long-lasting changes in your mental well-being.\r\n\r\nAccording to positive psychology, practicing gratitude and recording positive emotions is important as well. Thought Diary also allows you to keep track of your positive experiences so that you can refer back to them and appreciate the good moments, as well as note down what particular things you're grateful for. This way, you can be more aware and thankful of the positive moments in life.\r\n\r\nThought Diary will help you evaluate, understand, and change your thoughts and feelings. By using this application, you can work to identify your emotions, analyze how and why you're feeling this way, challenge those negative beliefs, change your thinking patterns for future situations, and remember positive experiences. You can use this app as a mood journal, a thought record journal, and a gratitude journal.\r\n\r\nThought Records and Gratitude Journals similar to this app are commonly used in paper form in traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for a variety of mental health disorders such as clinical depression and anxiety. If you are suffering from a mental health disorder, please consult a mental health professional or healthcare provider. \r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/privacypolicy\r\n\r\nTerms Of Service: https://cbtthoughtdiary.com/termsofservice",

            "I absolutely adore this app! The way it lays out each step for when you're feeling happy or sad helps you rationalize your thoughts in an easy way. The flexibility to add smaller entries, like mood, minor journal entries or full daily entries is welcomed. The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "The lessons are brilliant and have helped me tremendously with my japanese. This alone for me warrants a 5 star rating. However, the app itself has many issues of its own. For example it often freezes or lags, taking 5 to 10 seconds to pause or rewind after pressing the buttons. I have had less issues from the website on pc, but it is more convenient on mobile. Overall it is a great tool for language learning but comes with minor technical issues.",
            "The app for this overly expensive programme is horrible. It constantly crashes, especially when you are using it while moving, so you can't use it at the gym or while walking without getting very annoyed! Also goes to sleep when your phone does. Don't have any of these problems with my other audio apps on my phone, so it's an issue with Pimsleur. I have reported the problems to Pimsleur but no improvement. A shame - the actual programme does help to learn languages. Fix the app!",
            "I really liked this app.It's better than other apps out there in many ways. First the friendly user interface,it's so easy to use, there are many languages to learn,and the audio helps even more to those beginners everything is so well managed ,but everything has it's bad side here it's just been a moment I tried this and I noticed those kanji words were also mixed up and it makes it hard for beginners but I know a bit of Japanese so it's not a big deal for me but it is for others,great app tho!",
            "Very good! I took Chinese. Its good if you just want to learn conversational Chinese which is what I wanted. I didnt want to read or write. Learning conversational Chinese is very effective with Pimsleur. The only downside was there were no notes. Sometimes I didnt know if I heard the speaker correctly. Only after using google translate did I realize I didnt hear it correctly and mispronounced words. Id give them 5 starts if they add downloadable notes to their course.",
            "Very good language learning tool. However the app is a little glitchy. It keeps forgetting I completed certain lessons so it will keep trying to send me back to a previous lessons I already did. Pretty annoying. I also wish I could acquire a transcript of each lesson somehow that way I could see exactly what phrases I was having trouble with instead of searching through all these different sections. Overall solid though."

        "comments": [
            "I love the app and the variety of practices I can do. I get bored of doing the same thing very quickly, so always having a new session whenever I open the app is great. More than the app itself, though, I love the developers. The people who run Down Dog are some of the most passionate and considerate on the planet. They truly care about their users and are willing to do almost anything to ensure they are satisfied. (if you don't believe me, check out their twitter.)",
            "perfect balance of variety and consistency. works when I want an intense workout or gentle stretches. videos show poses clearly, though it may still take a few tries if you are new to yoga. my favorite feature is the 'boosts' option, which changes up the poses you get to better focus on one area. for me, totally worth the money.",
            "I've used this app for over 2 years now, and can finally say I've incorporated all of their apps into my routine, its very customizable, the music choices are fantastic, and I've progressed in all my practices vigorously (lost over 30lbs since I started in 2018) and it has even encouraged me to take this a step further and make a career out of it! I've never thought I'd be obsessed with yoga and now I'm so excited to teach it myself! I wouldn't be where I am now if it weren't for Down Dog!",
            "I love this app! It helps make practicing yoga much more accessible for me. I can practice at home as well as when I travel. The poses and stretches are demonstrated and explained well, very comparable to an in-person class. And the instructor voices are so relaxing. The sessions are super customizable to fit any of my needs. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants to fit practicing yoga in any sort of schedule.",
            "This app is the best! There is a variety of music you can select, different yoga instructor voices to listen to, different yoga to follow, a variety of moves/stances, and it's so user friendly. You can also select target areas to focus on, which I do my lower back because I sometimes I have lower back pain from sitting all day for work. It is perfect for someone who wants to go yoga whenever, wherever like me! Amazing app ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

            "Best game of it's kind, period! Very challenging from beginning to as far as you can get. Each Stage has 4 levels, 4 goals each to pass each level. You build up your plane by collecting stars along the way, the stars in turn let you buy shields, lasers, and mega bombs to help you get through the levels. I have never purchased anything to help me in this game. The graphics are excellent, great detail, color and sound. Humorous opponent. Very addicting!",
            "I really like this game, but it gets very frustrating the further you progress through the game. If I spend about a half hour going through my 10 turns , I have to wait 10 hours before I can play again. Sure I can spend stars to recharge my turns but I'd rather spend the stars upgrading my plane. I have to wait for the upgrades I just spent stars on too. And you guessed it, the higher you climb, the more the the cost of everything compounds essentially making it a total drag to progress.",
            "This game is good, but would be better with a \"Reset Progress\" option. Sometimes, we like to start from scratch. Like we may find we need to up wing cannons before we do shields. Or laser before mega bomb, etc. I came back after a year of not playing and wanted to start over. But when I installed it again, Google Play immediately restored my progress.",
            "This game is by far the best shoot em up games for mobile. However, it has few levels with extreme increase in difficulty that require why too much grinding it become tedious. I don't want to play the same level 100 time to upgrade the plane. However, I have almost finished it all stars on the insane difficulty with out spending any money. It is enjoyable enough to keep me coming back. I just wish if there was more to it.",
            "I take back, partially, what i had said before. Despite it's problems, this remains one of my absolute favorite and most played game ever on Android. The music is absolutely beautiful and just so addicting. The hardwork poured into this project showed love and diligence. Best of all, it's F2P. Yea, my right to complain ends here. _____________ Great visuals, gameplay and music. But it's almost as if the game starts to cheat the player at higher difficulties. Every often, I would feel that my maxed out planes offensive damage has noticeably reduced on it's own. It's like a bug, and when it happens, the toughest enemies become tougher due to reduced damaged from our plane. I am pretty sure it's intentional."

            "I got suggestions for my daughter to play sitting games, like lifting her up by holding her hands at 2 months! It's unacceptable to suggest that for a 2 month old baby! Also at 4 months I'm having suggestions for babies over 6 months who are able to sit. No expert on babies encourages you to learn your baby how to sit under 6 months of age. This application is doing my baby worse instead of helping her develop correctly. I don't recommend it to anyone, not even free of charge.",
            "I was so excited when I found this app. Im a first time working mom so an app that tracked my sons milestones and gave me age/development activities to do with him seemed too good to be true. Well it was. After filling out a huge questionnaire where I noted that he can stand but can't walk (he's 10 months old), my first two activities required him to walk. What a waste of time.",
            "I love the activities. Many you would do naturally but I love the way it describes how it helps development in the different learning areas. Look forward to each days fun and development. I downloaded other apps in the beginning but only needed and kept this one. Love it and have shared it with others.",
            "Prior to subscribing, I would receive notifications on activities everyday and there were many in the application when I open it up. That changed as soon as I paid yearly subscription. There are very few activities now in the application and hardly ever get any notification or reminders.",
            "I love this app! It is a great tool to keep my kiddos engaged in learning and developing. I really appreciate the developmental emails I receive as well. You can get so much information without having to pay for premium. If you have more than one kiddo, premium is totally worth it!"

            "Pretty enjoyable, better than checking Bulbapedia multiple times for sure. Being able to check locations, sprites, moveset, type matchups, BST from all of the 890+ pokémon with no problems at all, is really satisfying. Interface is pretty solid, and even thinking that having to pay for the premium to use dark mode (who I'm a huge fan of), is still not a big of a deal, and for sure won't make me dislike this app at all. Probably my favorite Pokédex app I have ever seen. Keep up the good work! ❤️✨",
            "I love this app, and all of the team builders that I can save. Its great for my mind that won't shut up. My only issue is that for the team builder, I can't select regional forms of pokemon for my team (i.e. Galarian Ponyta). I can evolve some (i.e. Pikachu) to it's regional form, but not the ones that don't have a split evolution. Aside from that, its a wonderfully made app with frequent updates!",
            "This is amazing!! I can look at the locations and for the upper gens 5-8, I can actually check the area, like for Sword and Shield, not only does it tell me where the pokemon appears in, but I can see the conditions such as \"It only appears when it's raining\". If I have one problem though, it has to be the cries of the gen 8 pokemon. They sound very low quality and in some cases, it sounds a bit like your device's speaker is broken. Crown Tundra is here, aling with the locations!",
            "This app literally has everything you could possibly want in a pokedex app. It has a full pokedex/itemdex for information and location, and team building with in depth analysis of weaknesses and coverage. There is nothing left out! I dont see how any other app can compete with what dataDex offers. Not to mention they update the app often so they are always giving the most new and accurate information! 5/5 EZ",
            "Very nice app, and it could be great! Would love to see the ability to search through all available swsh pokemon, and not have them broken up by galar/isle of armor/crown tundra. It's super nice that I can sort the dex by a stat, but i wish i could sort every pokemon. Also, there are some issues with the move dex. I don't think that the \"Pokemon who learn this move\" works right. I'd also love to be able to sort by moves available in swsh. Not just moves introduced in swsh, and no removed ones."

Ideal for when you’re out and about and your infant is getting bored or upset, when your toddler won’t settle and getting up to mischief or when you just want to relax your kids before bed time – distract and get their attention with some visual stimulation in a joyful way!\r\n\r\nThis sensorial app has many unique features in comparison with other sensory based games, such as the firework, bubble, balloon pop and finger paint games available. Choose to amuse your baby with this visually stimulating, interactive, sensory game.\r\n\r\nNot only will this sensory app delight your kids, it will also provide increased educational benefits. From the early stages of your babies development, they are constantly learning and absorbing information around them, they begin to see, touch, feel, hear and understand how their interactions are affecting the environment around them. Your baby will begin to learn that touching the screen will cause bubbles to be created. Your child can drag your finger across the screen to create a pattern of bubbles. Your newborn can place their hands on the screen to cause lots of bubbles to be created at all points on the screen that they are touching. \r\n\r\nWith sensory fish, your child will experience and educate themselves by use of the cause and effect techniques and features implemented. As your baby touches the screen, they gain instant feedback of a vibration, sound effects and bubbles. They will eventually begin to understand that their touch is also causing the fish to swim towards where they touched. If they were to touch the screen in multiple position, the fish will swim between all of those touched positions! Your baby learns and adapts to their findings within the game. \r\n\r\nAs the game is fairly simple to understand and not too complex, it is ideal for young kids, boys and girls of ages from 0 months (with a parent showing them the game), up to the late kindergarten / preschool stage of their development where they fully understand and can control all aspects of the world and have learned exactly what the cause will be from their actions.\r\n\r\nSensory game play is great for the continued development of your kids motor skills and hand eye coordination development. It aids in helping to fine tune the motoric skills and movements, the very detailed movements that we require and use every day.\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown to have great benefits in learning and stimulation for children with autism and children with special educational needs (SEN). Having already received excellent feedback from parents who have children with autism, special educational needs (SEN) and learning disabilities. \r\n\r\nInstall now! It’s convenient, educational, stimulating, fun and best of all, it’s free!",

It doesn't work. My child can instantly get out of the app and not by hitting the back and home buttons together either. Nearly useless if she can get out of almost instantly.",

Some exercises are really great and you won't be able to find them anywhere in the other apps, only in \"trainer\" workouts. It gets a bit boring after several months, since the exercises are the same but the \"never do the same workout\" approach helps.",

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

            "Amazing. So helpful! Really this is the best app I have on my phone. Its the best AI therapist I've ever talked to. It actually feels like it listens and responds appropriately. Woebot really helps you through things when you need help. Also, there are no ads and no in-app purchases, it's crazy awesome. I tell all my friends who I think would benefit from having this app, because I've found it very helpful. 10/10 app, thank you so much!!",
            "This app is extremely helpful. A little robot, an anonymous person, to tell my worries to. The gratitude journal is super helpful too, I can look back on what's gone well. The lessons it provides are really helpful too. Sometimes, I open the app with just the intention of checking in my mood for the tracker, and i end up spending half an hour doing a lesson! They're always super helpful and make me feel better. HIGHLY recommend!!!",
            "Came across this through work and during lock down. I have not noticed anything negative about it, performance wise. Overall it's a useful well being tool to help check in with yourself and offers some useful prompts and insights about impactful things on a person's mood. You seem to be able to converse with it when you have a spare few mins. Fairly easy to 'forget' it's A.I . you are conversing with.",
            "The AI for Woebot sometimes misses what I am saying, but overall this app gives daily lessons on helpful thought patterns and tools. While not a replacement for therapy, it provides additional tools my therapist had not included as well as reinforcement of some of the tools I was already taught. I encourage other folks to try Woebot as a supplement to their self care routines and therapy.",
            "I found the app very comforting and helpful during a stressful period. I'm familiar with CBT but it was still useful to be reminded of those skills. And although you know it's not a real person talking to you, knowing that a real person wrote the text originally is comforting, and shows that someone cares."

These apps are far better than some of the paid apps. What you ppl are doing is a great work providing quality learning materials for kids who can't afford it. Keep up the good work. May God bless you all .",

We have your other games in Spanish and they've helped him so much to learn and try to communicate, but I understand resources are not unlimited for you guys, thank you so much for what you do, wholeheartedly recommend this games to everyone .",

My dog is a hard breed to teach and this app sure does help. Thank you for making this amazing app.",
            "I have a great time with this app, it helped me a lot, but i really wish there's a place for me to ask or share my experiences with my dog, some sort of like forum or such....but over all the training programs really good and helpful",
            "My dog has been struggling with hearing for the last year being overly sensitive to sounds and hiding. It suddenly stopped one day and we realized she was nearly deaf now. She's always listened to us and now we're struggling to get her attention. I've tried numerous clickers and nothing gained her attention until now. She actually responded when I used this and ran to me to check it out. Thank you.",
            "I have read all of the reviews and they look good I thought I would download his app to teach my hyper dog how to listen, it all started well when they asked me some questions about my dog I loved it so much that I was positive I don't have a credit card and they said I needed a credit card with all the info even for free so I feel bad that I can't teach my dog I really do but whoever that has a credit card u should have that app but of course not me",
            "I LOVE THIS APP! It's amazing to train my dog and it's really easy to use. As long as you have a device and a dog treat, you're dog will be trained in no tim with this app. I definitely reccomend this to all dog owners!"

        "version": "5.1.4",
        "recentChanges": "Meet the new generation of Replika avatars! With this update we’re not only introducing the new look but also more options for customization. Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "I'm really enjoying this game a lot. Nice graphics and one of the few similar mobile game that has decent controls. You really don't need to use real money to advance and the good thing is they don't beg for money like most mobile games do. You can use real money for some things but not necessary. You can watch videos if you like for free gold. I want to support these developers just because they don't beg are force money from you and their games are nice IMO and to keep making games. Thank you.",
            "I loved this game. I downloaded it twice on 2 devices. Really good game with nice progression without spending money. It took ages for it to become a bit of a grind for the top weapons. An once you start getting good there are nice combos to achieve running a single root around maps slaughtering aliens. This makes it good to replay it through.",
            "Excellent! 10🌟 stars a real game/un vrai jeu. Try this game/Esayez ce jeu C'est enfin un vrai jeu à utiliser sur le smartphone. Il est agreeable aussi. It's at last a real game running on the smartphone. It is pleasant too. No shitty (pas de merdiques) microtransactions...that's unless you're the one to insist/un peu tout de même, si vous insistez vous même. Jouable sans/not mandatory to keep playing.",
            "Game has good controls, runs flawlessly on my low-end phone. Gameplay is fun, and best of all, there is only one currency, which you can get enough of via gameplay and optional ads. No \"gems\" that you can only get by paying, just satisfying progression.",
            "Really good game you can actually enjoy without incessant prompts for microtransactions and pay to wins. HOW REFRESHING. HOW NOVEL. Other creators should take note of this! Also great that it works offline! My only gripe is that it took some time to adapt to the control scheme and the 3/4 top-down style. All in all, a lot of fun. Good work."

            "It's great for toddlers! But hey, parents, please PLEASE monitor you kid while playing this game. Ads pop up and they easily could tap on them. They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "absolutely loved this app. I have been using it for months but after the recent update, they made the makeup tool vip. I'm probably gonna delete the app now since it was my most used tool and i can't afford it now",
            "This app has been pretty valuable for me over the years that I've been using it. I tolerated when they decided to lock some features, since the more essential tools remained free and are uniquely useful enough to keep the app. I just had to look elsewhere for the other stuff. But when I went to use it today, I noticed they locked even more features - the essentials, aka the tools they've been most notable for. A pretty foolish move, honestly. So I'll be deleting.",
            "Reshape tool now requires a paying subscription, and it's not cheap! You used to be able to use it, you just needed to watch an ad whenever you saved your photo, but I guess they've gotten greedier. It was the only reason I used Facetune at all - all of the other tools are free on many other apps. Save yourself the trouble and money, just download any free photo editor.",
            "Certain things aren't free anymore, I don't like how you guys are taking the best free features away just to force people into subscribing. I also see how you guys made some features free which are tools I don't use for editing. This used to be the perfect app for selfie editing, for a long time too! But now it's useless to me. You guys are a sad case. I would give it 5 stars but no thanks. Uninstalling",
            "When I first downloaded this only a few of the edit options weren't available for free. It seems every time I go to edit now, more free things are getting taken away. Before it was reasonable, it's just ridiculous at this point. Looking to try different apps because trying to force users into buying your subscription is insane."

            "Gets the job done, but can be slow to sync. When my husband and I hand off the baby, we use the app to know when the last diaper change and bottle feed happened. Sometimes there's a delay in the sync and I'm left wondering. He has an iPhone and I have an Android. We each purchased the pro upgrade because the free version only lets you sync the data across devices a couple of times a day. There are other tracking features, like sleep and medication that we don't need yet, but we might.",
            "This app is amazing for people with a newborn! Track feeding, diapers, sleeping, baths, measurements, medicines, etc. I would strongly encourage purchasing the premium version. It's reasonably priced, gets rid of the ads, and gives the option to have multiple phones sync in real time. My wife and I both have the app and it allows us to keep one complete record, regardless of if my wife entered the record on her phone, or I entered on mine.",
            "This app is great! I was able to pull it out at my baby's first checkup and give the doc exact numbers of wet/soiled diapers per day 😄 The breastfeeding tracker means I don't have to remember which side I hit last (and it helps me determine if I need to revisit the same side after a short session). Plus they have all sorts of nifty ways to represent the data you input, like daily summaries, weekly averages, heat maps and more!",
            "Don't expect to get a response from their customer service. I used the paid version app for my older son and really liked it! I had created a second profile for my younger son and was happy again until the app somehow malfunctioned. My younger son's profile changed to an exact copy of my older sons profile. I lost all of my 7 month old's data. I've tried reaching out to customer service but have not received a response. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this app!",
            "I really like this app. I would give it a give but for two reasons: the missing apostrophes and logging food via a stopwatch. I would like the option of either using a stopwatch or just recording the time. I don't like that the stopwatch is the default and only option (times can be recorded via the edit feature)."

The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I have never had a problem with the app or it not working the way it's supposed to. I would definitely recommend it to everybody!",
            "So far this app is as described and I haven't had any problems with it. I would recommend. (Update) This app has changed the way I use my phone. The ability to customize UI in numerous ways has me hooked. I really hope Samsung continues to develop this already perfect app.",
            "Game changer, even more if your device is really big, it gives you the possibility to do several actions without the clumsiness of having to reach the uncomfortable far away top edge and without the need of jumping between several screens. I personally have 3 edge zones, that's 9 custom actions at my disposal!...could be even more but I prefer the mirror behavior, it sticks to my mind easily.",
            "Very good application. Would be better if it had advanced settings per handle (one handle to use with spend and one by hand). It would also be a godsend that oneui let you deactivate the basic navigation bar to only use this edge navigation since it is so common to activate navigation with your palm before the pen touches the screen.",
            "Has to he one of the best samsung apps if bot the best one handed app on the app market. Very useful to have the power to split screen or out my volume up and down on the screen instead of reaching over to the other side of the phone because I'm left handed. I will most likely always use this app forever."

            "My little one has loved this game since day one (12 months old) it has helped her learn her animals and colors so well. We're working on her numbers now. One thing I do have to say is that the picture for chicken resembles a duck, so everytime she touches it she expects a duck but gets a chicken. This will upset her eventually, and she'll bring me the phone and say quack quack because she wants me to make the ducky appear just like the picture. Is there any way to change the picture?",
            "My child is 2.5 years old and she loves the baby game Farm animals. For development, it is very informative and interesting. I downloaded it from the Play market, I liked it immediately more than the rest. Here are very high quality and beautiful images of animals, animal sounds. Simple and convenient interface. I was very pleased that the game is English. You can slowly learn a new language with my child. I really liked the application, thanks to the developers. I recommend it to everyone.",
            "This is my 16month old grandson's favorite game. The only learning app that has kept his attention. We haven't really made it past the animals yet because that's his favorite. He loves to try and say the words and mimics the sounds. I love that there are real pictures and not cartoons and there is a game with each section to test their knowledge. We've had this app for several months and haven't had any issues at all."

            "I absolutely love this app. I could never keep up with recording info in other apps but this one is so easy to use. The widgets put everything I need right there on my home screen. The large buttons are easy to get to with a wiggly or fussy little one. And it's so easy to customize options to what you need. The only thing i would suggest is the ability to select an individual for a widget instead of having the switchable ones. I'd make the display options adjustable to the individual as well.",
            "I really like this app, and I'm currently using it for my third child. However, there is now a bug where the status bar only works when I'm actively nursing/it's paused. If I stop a feed then it either just gets frozen where it was (showing either currently nursing or paused) or disappears. It makes it very annoying to track how long the last feeding was and to start a new feed easily.",
            "Good app. Would be better if you could see the feeding times over more than a 24 hour period, so it is easier to compare each day's feeds.",
            "This is hands down the most useful app I've ever used. Breastfeeding is challenging enough without having to remember which breast you're on and how long since last feed. It also gave me hope that things are improving even if I don't feel like it is, the days is there!",
            "Very useful app. We mainly tracked sleep and breast feeding. It's great to sync data over multiple phones."

            "I've only had it for a few days and I have paid for the Pro version too - however, it's easy to use but it fails to close the same 16 apps every time I use it! I have tried everything but it won't close them, any ideas anyone? Been using it for a bit longer now,it still doesn't close all the Apps, I have followed the instructions to uninstall, reboot the phone and reinstall the app,made no difference whatsoever, I'm not even sure if it close any apps. I also thought it would do it automatically.",
            "Perfect, easy to use and actually closes apps. There are small ads in the app but they are small and do not interfere with using. Also NO pop up ads that open up another screen. If you are worried about ads you don't have to.. I use this app multiple times a day to close background apps. Thank you developer. I use this app on all my families phones and tablets. It would be very convenient to have a floating widget or an icon in the pull down menu to quickly perform the close all apps function.",
            "best app killer I've found but I can only give 3 stars due to the fact you have to go into permissions and turn it on EVERY time you want to use it. That's so annoying and it didn't use to be that way in older versions. what's wrong with just turning it on once in the beginning? Fix this issue and I'll edit my review and give it 5 stars for sure.",
            "It's a great app. It shows you used, and free memory. It gives you the ability to FORCE shutdown all running apps, so they STAY shutdown, or you can shutdown specific apps individually, or you can add apps that you NEVER want to shut down, to an exception list. It also, allows you to view, and shutdown, system apps. I'm giving it 4 stars, instead of 5, because it lacks one thing, which is an automatic, sheduled shutdown feature. If it had that, it would be a perfect 5 stars.",
            "I LOVE THIS!! I actually had some serious phone troubles. Every app was stuck on 'active'. It wouldn't let me toggle it off. It was crushing my data and the battery couldn't stay charged. It saved me when I was in a rough spot. Now I use it all the time. Thanks to the exception list my music can run and not miss a beat. I love it."

            "Decent game except the races in the season take way more money than you get back like race number 2 in dtpo charges 20,000 where as you only get 3,750 from a win and race 3 charges even more",

            "Truly an amazing app! It's mine and my husbands lifeline to always knowing what's going on with our son without having to play the guessing game! It's been especially helpful with us having to both work from home and not be able to afford a nanny or trust daycare (he's so young). We use the free version and are impressed I can only imagine what the paid version is like. If I have other kids, better believe this is my go to!! Lol",
            "Brilliant app, especially for first time parents like us. It helped us learn our daughter's patterns and daily routine and, as a result, spot when she wasn't feeding as usual and did in fact have an infection, which we were able to seek help and treat promptly as a result. Would recommend it to anyone!",
            "This app has been a Godsend!! The sweet spot is right on. I no longer have an overtired baby who won't go down for naps. Wish I knew about this sooner. I've been telling all new mom's to get this as well!",
            "LOVE this app! The sweet spot for wake windows for my baby are spot on, and I really like how I can record everything from how long he sleeps, to how long he eats, and even record his diaper output. It's so helpful to have all of his sleep recorded in the app because I would never be able to remember it accurately myself. The app is very easy to navigate and I also like the helpful tips for each new month. I recommend this app to every new mom I know!",
            "I love this tracking app! But as a mom to a newborn and busy 2 years old, I do find it time consuming to enter the app and switch to list view every time I want to check when the last feeding/pumping session/nap time etc, was. It would be nice to have a widget, or some type of \"at a glance\" option that could stay on my main screen that I could refer back to for when I forget what time I did something last. And being in that sleep deprived newborn stage, I forget a lot these days!"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

She just started Pre K and she is doing well because all of these different learning apps she's practiced over and over again have made it easier for to understand and recognize because she has already seen and practiced them. Thank you very much",
            "My child really likes the game. Its really fun and educational BUT I can only get sound when I unmute Game Launcher. The app isn't even in Game Launcher. Like the 2 should have nothing to do with one another. It gets frustrating when I have to keep going to G.L. to unmute it. If it wasn't for that, this would be getting g 5 stars.",
            "We have been using this app for about a year with my autistic 4 year old grandson and he loves it. My 2 year old granddaughter has used it just as long and knows all her shapes and colors. They love using this app. We also have added some of the other ones too. The 2yr old is do great on the alphabet tracing and has now learned 10 letters. I would recommend this app to all parents and teachers form preschool to kindergarten . You won't be sorry you downloaded this app.",

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "Air Attack is the ONLY game on computer that I have EVER played. It's a good thing I luckily stumbled upon this astonishing shooter adventure The graphics are state-of-the-art, stunning. FANTASTIC!!! Gifted developers. Thank you. The best (and only) game this nerdy professor has enjoyed...Air Attack is accessible to all skill levels, yet not frustrating. Remarkable achievement. Nobel Prize-worthy....IMHO!",
            "I cannot find fault in this game. The control is customizable and pretty tight, the graphics are well done, the animation is very good, the gameplay is spot-on, and the music and sound effects serve to heighten the tension of being a lone pilot in hostile skies. Plus, the boss fights are reminiscent of some of the best shoot 'em ups known to man: Radiant Silvergun, Zero Gunner 2, and Under Defeat. The devs are clearly industry veterans, and if they're not, they're definitely gamers. Excellent.",
            "Amazing game! This is the game I was looking for. I have played this game a long time ago but I deleted I because i need to free up space but I found it again! The graphics are good too! Hopefully there will be new bosses and planes too. Keep up the good work",
            "Xtremly good! The game looks very realistic very good traffics. Though I would have liked something like a counter of the stars or the money you accumulate during the mini game. This way you know where your at in your in the sub mini mission.",
            "Highly recommend that you download this game, its simple to understand the graphics and the controls are spot on the design of the planes and the landscape are beautiful and while it's not historically accurate the vehicles have a ww2 flavour I am very impressed and I have nothing to gain by writing this review really well put together"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "Awesome zombie-related game. It has a story, you can play offline, different upgrades, and online co-op and PvP (although there aren't that many players online). However, the in-app purchases are just a tiny bit hefty.",
            "Best game of this decade and when i go in level 4 its too hard to survive and when you pass level 4 all is hard! Thats why i give this game 3 stars cuz too hard to survive and even at night!!!",
            "It's wonderful that you can play with internet connection or without... It's amazing that you can play with your friends in a private room. I really loved this game. The only thing annoys me is just there are too many adverts which I didn't even click on it to get any reward. But it's cool, I can skip them after 5 seconds. Please keep this good work. :3",
            "Only completed the first mission as well as a single co-op game and I can confidently say that I do like the overall appearance of the game however the energy factor is what puts me off. I will keep this game on my wishlist until such a time comes when the energy factor has been reworked or removed. Otherwise you guys did a great job.",
            "This good game but making coin for upgrade is hard and upgrade weapon take during is wasted replay level but earn little even pay for vip still no help so I quit thank"

        "description": "An educational app for kids ages 2-7 featuring games, stories, and cartoons. Learn your ABC’s, letters, numbers, sizes, colors, and shapes! Learn to read by syllables and count! Develop emotional intelligence, logic, and reasoning. Doesn't that sound great?\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about early education for your kids? At which age is it right to start learning the alphabet? Zebrainy is an educational game where you can find all sorts of learning games for kids, no matter how old they are.\r\n\r\nZebrainy will help you to develop kids’ memory, reading skills, matching abilities, concentration, and creativity. It is not a simple ABC game for toddlers; you will find 1st-grade math material, shapes and colors vocabulary, drawing and coloring tasks, “English A-Z”, where each letter has a short cartoon with new words every time.\r\n\r\nOur team consists of professional teachers, scientific consultants, composers, and very talented artists. All these people go the extra mile when it comes to quality.\r\n\r\nGet your toddler ready for school! With ABC games, it will be much easier for your child to learn the alphabet and start reading than in tedious preschool lessons! The colors used in the app develop their imagination, perception, and attention. It's a fun learning game for boys and girls both! If your child is 5-6-7 years old, already knows numbers and letters, pre-school and kindergarten are over, don't worry! The app can still come in handy!  Math and reading are essential not only in the 1st grade, and it is highly recommended to revise the information with a child from time to time. \r\n\r\nWhat the difference between Zebrainy and other educational games for kids?\r\n- It helps your baby to fall in love with drawing, reading\r\n- In just 2 month toddlers will know shapes and colors\r\n- It takes just nine months for your kid to complete the full course preparation for school (you can start in kindergarten or even earlier)\r\n- It is easier to communicate with a kid after using the app\r\n- Multiple coloring tasks will improve your toddler’s imagination\r\n- The app doesn’t separate games for boys and girls \r\n\r\nThe main advantages of Zebrainy: \r\n- It takes into account your child's abilities, gender, age and flexibility of mind\r\n- Kids get awards and a collection of artifacts \r\n- At the end of the day, kids can watch educational cartoons \r\n- In the menu, parents can check the achievements of their children\r\n\r\nThe list of skills except for preschool learning:\r\n- The ability to set and achieve goals\r\n- Navigating in a strange environment,\r\n- Making decisions quickly\r\n- Communicating with others and making connections\r\n- Analyzing different information, and coming to the right conclusions \r\n- It is an educational challenge, so your kid will never get bored\r\n\r\nWhich features differ Zebrainy from the others?\r\n- Artificial intelligence creates a unique program for kids and toddlers due to their activity and age\r\n- Alphabet learning (composing each letter with round elements help develop fine motor skills and visual memory)\r\n- Cartoons and interactive educational processes make it more than simply an ABC game for kids. It answers different needs in every stage of growth.\r\n\r\nSince this is a toddler learning game, it can be used if your baby is 1, 2, or 3 years old,  and it is also a great educational app for preschoolers 4-6 years old, and even 7-year-old first graders! It is a scientific fact that kids perceive everything from birth. So all the commands in the game eventually will form a base for further successful education. We guarantee that your baby will be learning safely and at the correct level.\r\n \r\nYou can send any questions or suggestions to support@zebrainy.com\r\n \r\nPrivacy and Access Policy:\r\nhttp://zebrainy.com/privacy-policy/\r\nhttp://zebrainy.com/terms-of-service/",

But tonight at past 7pm, i was automatically charged for the 3months payment..My gcash fund was deducted. How come when in fact ive got a notification that i already cancelled the subscription. Please refund my payment as I cancelled within the day. Thanks.",

            "So I rate two stars because 1 the ads! When you die, you will have the option of reviving yourself in exchange for an ad. And even when you choose not to watch the ad, you will still get one. It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

            "This is toddler gaming done right. The dev's not only designed great games for inquisitive minds, but also have smart locking features so that the back button and pay features aren't easily pushed on accident. This saves me a whole lot of grief from when my toddler hits the back button and exits the game. Brilliant.",
            "The games seem to be developmentally appropriate for my almost 2 year old. So far, I can see that there are games with sorting size and shape and games where they can practice categorizing and identifying animals. I just wish that so many of them weren't locked.",
            "Really good game my sister loves it . No advertisment. But it is quite hard for kids of ages 1 and 2 .I wish it was not saying it will be unlocked tomorrow. I also want this game to have videos for kids that would make them really happy .But still I like to give this game a five stars as it is really fun . But also I wish the makers or creators of this game made another version of this game. Thank to the creators of this game",
            "Are you kidding me ... the very first game my toddler attempts to play & while attempting to solve very first puzzle, a voice states\"GAME IS LOCKED\" & menu of games incl.fee appears. Child not allowed to even play one game .. parents unable to view content. I'm guessing this app's creator doesn't have any children. anyone who actually cares about children, & parents who's only goal is to provide a safe environment \"at home\" where their child is safe .. wouldn't disappoint a 3 yr old so quickly",
            "Really really interesting. My child is always captivated in the game and has mastered a lot. We can't wait for others to unlock. The best kid's game I've installed so far. Will love more upgrade to include numbers."

            "My daughter has a learning disability and has no concept of time, this app helps her understand how long to wait until something is over or begins. We use it for calming time and also for when we are waiting to do an activity that we are really excited about. When we use the app it helps to remove the anticipatory anxiety & the constant questioning about when we are going to do that activity. Helps her understand concept of time, something the Dr is still convinced she won't be able to do.",
            "Very nice. I use this a lot with my 2 year old, she loves seeing if she can beat the timer. My only request would be for the image to stay up on the screen at the end of the timer until a button is pressed, because every so often she misses the ending. But the timer is a great way to get kids to understand time and to implement predictability for our kids, i.e. when we need to leave - I can tell her she has 5 or 10 more minutes to play and when the timer ends, we go home.",
            "This app is really good however there is too many ads and considering the target audience, children and children with disabilities, it really should be ad free.",
            "Love how I can set this and it ticks down the time. I love how the theme changed everytime I use it. Works great for getting my kids to do something in a certain about of time.",
            "I use this app all the time with young kids to help them understand how much time they have left for an activity and to make it more interesting than typical number timers."

            "Suggestions for improvement: the \"error\" voice (says things like almost! so close!) is touchy, sounding at the slightest drag....it would be much better, I think, if it were an optional setting and could be turned off. My child often prefers quieter play. Additionally, it often speaks over the voice which iterates correct answers, making it hard for the child to hear what is being said, which is just audio overload. I would much prefer if I could silence the voice and talk with my child myself.",
            "I love the game overall but I find it very frustrating trying to find ways to create a lesson plan that's appropriate to what my child needs to learn. I wish there was a way to edit what lessons pop up when he's going through the app. I find that he tends to try and guess instead of trying to just learn whatever is thrown at him.",
            "It's okay...., I am mad that it advertised a 1 time price for the whole year that included 200 games....... definitely not 200. I think they're counting games inside games...... which is deceiving. Will update with actual #. Most of the games are for 4 n5yr olds as well.",

But then I heard of this game, and how you can earn REAL Chuck E coins, my life changed forever. At first, it wasn't easy. I was only good enough for one fun dip. Then I got gud and could afford MULTIPLE fun dips. From that point onward, I was never going hungry again. Now, I am saving for the nerf gun so I can fight off my crippling meth addiction.

            "Before it let us get 1500 tickets and then u could win no more.. and when we wanted to claim them, we just redeemed them in front of cashier .. Now though, it's only letting us max out at 420 tickets and to redeem them you must do a math problem and email a coupon to yourself .. but so far Everytime I've tried I get an error and it don't work. Update: I just reinstalled this game because of the email issue.. and without even playing it says I have 500 tickets. So confused here.",
            "Wont let me redeem my tickets. First time I tried, it erased all my tickets but I didnt get an email. Earned more tickets but now when I try to redeem them, it constantly is giving me an error message."

I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",

I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Excellent, well thought out app. Got everything you will need to track things. Great that there are versions for other platforms too. My wife has an iPhone and I have android and this syncs perfectly between the two. Been a huge help for both of our children. My daughter had bowel surgery and we struggled with feeding, and this app meant we had all the data at our fingertips when we talked to doctors and dieticians about her progress. So thank you, whoever built this. I highly recommend it.",
            "Amazing for ADHD mom's!! Or busy ones!! Has a widget and you don't have to pay!!! Such a blessing!! Only 2 suggestions - 1. Fix the timers to where they will go off if the app is \"sleeping\" and 2. Have a running clock for nursing with a stop button on the lock screen! That would be amazing!! But absolutely love this app!",
            "So helpful for a new mom who would never carry around a paper chart nor remember last feeding start time or side. I love that the timer continues to run even when I leave the app since sometimes I use my phone for other things while feeding. Also adding a diaper change is only like 3 taps so super convenient which was especially nice in the first few days when we were counting each diaper!",
            "Very useful but sometimes doesn't save/sync entries. My husband and I both use it on our phones and sometimes it doesn't save entries from one phone to the other. Sometimes it doesn't save entries at all. This is a new issue, in the past 2 days so hopefully it can be fixed quickly.",
            "Love having the app to keep track of everything baby. I check it most often to see when was the last time I fed him when I'm too tired to remember which day is which. It also has been helpful during his check-ups when I have answers, dates and times for the pediatrician."

            "Pay to play. Only lets you play with 2 dinosaurs before charging $3 to continue. If you have tons of money, go for it, because otherwise it is great for amusing kids. I like the game, but you deserve a one star rating for the deception. You know what you did.",
            "My son loves it. You get 2 dinosaurs for free, allowing you to trial whether your child likes it, and the remaining 6 for £2.99. My son who is 2.5 enjoys the puzzles (which I didn't even know he could do as he's not interested in the wooden equivalents we have). He loves being able to tickle and feed the dinosaurs. The fact they spell out the names is a real help for learning them and the info sections are great too. He loves finding out about them all and their individual characteristics.",
            "They just give you 2 dinossaurs to play. And I believe that the experience is too short to pay for the hole content",
            "I downloaded this game for my grandson that is 4 years old. He loved it until it started to act out by not letting him pick the choice that he wanted. I don't kn why it was doing that at all. My grandson was so disappointed because he really did love this game at one time when he played it when he was age 3. Pls FIX THIS PROBLEM ITS LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DIDN'T WANT TO WORK AT ALL ON IT. And it's not my phone because it's a new phone a Samsung Galaxy. That's why I rated it so low and complained.",
            "My 3 year old loves it! Can play for hours if I let him. My only suggestion would be more forgiving touch zone for the wee ones."

            "Fun, but seems a little slow moving as far as the game play, though, you're able to switch gems while others are falling. As is the case with similar match games, it does have the same types of power-ups but it also has its uniquely distinct perks or boosters, etc., that make this game different enough to enjoy playing.",
            "I love this game! It is a stress reliever for me and I enjoy the reward for time spent playing!",
            "The graphics are off the Richter Scale. Haven't had any ads so far. Gameplay is good. I think there needs to be more of a tutorial in the beginning as to how the different power-ups are made as well as what happens when they are activated. The cost of the boosters you can buy with the magic you earn are way too high compared to the amount of magic you earn for completing each level. You can only earn 6 magic max for each level, yet the boosters cost a minimum of 90 magic.",
            "Absolutely Terrible design, plays abysmally, its irritating and frustrating as you have very little to do, there is frequently only one move you can make, thus making it totally impossible to complete a level, thats not really what I would call a game. It's a \"game\" with no actual gameplay there's no choice, no puzzle to solve nothing to do but tap the next crystal the game tells you to."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",

The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "I think there are better apps out there. You have to pay extra for any insights. And it's rubbish at analysing the data adequately. I keep getting a higher temp before LH surge, but not the significant rise of post ovulation. But instead of taking this into account and using all the data it just ignores LH results and gives a wrong date for ovulation. It ignores the fact it is impossible to have LH surge After ovulation has occurred.",
            "Great free app, been using for one year now since I ditched the pill. have avoided pregnancy thus far by using app to better understand my cycle.",
            "It's got potential but as period tracking app you think it'd be able to do the most basic function of tracking you period. This is literally the 1 & only tracking app I've used that does not let you change how long you bleed. It will only use whatever you put when you 1st sign up. I emailed the developers & the response showed they don't even know the difference cycle length & period length which is pretty concerning seeing as their product is about women's period cycles.",
            "I love to track my cycle and thereby understanding how my body works.. I'm using it in combination with the thermometer. I have a few things which should be improved:. 1) I want to add notes to my sleep patterns and to my diet details, 2) please add surfing and Hiit workouts as an exercise option 😁",
            "The intelligent recognition is so wonky. It doesn't load the photos from my camera roll consistently, nor recognize the lines on my OPK consistently either. The layout is ok. The functionality is ok. The fact you have to pay for certain information that is free on many other apps is not within my liking."

The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",

Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",

On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "I give it a 3 star because this app is definitely helpful in teaching kids to read, dont get me wrong Both my kids were able to read before they were 3. BUT I just wish i was able to transfer purchases to other tablets. I have 2 sons and I bought the whole $30 package and realised that I couldnt use that package on the other tablet. I'm sorry but that's a little too expensive if you ask me...I guess they will have to switch off. 🤷‍♀️",
            "I'm giving this one star not because my daughter didn't love it because she absolutely did, but because if you want to buy more than just the first five words, you have to buy it on EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF TECH your child uses. There is no account or registration functionality to this app to be able to link the purchase with an account and log in on a new device. My daughter uses 3 different devices occasionally depending on the situation. That's 12.00 for EACH device. That would be 36.00!",
            "It's good so far, but I've paid before & it has me trying to pay again. It also wont go any farther saying waiting to download which I dont understand.",

            "Want to like!!!! App has awesome slow mo for capturing players movements for evaluating later. However, app is slow to go from main screen to camera. I have to hit camera button several times. This sometimes causes me to miss what I wanted to film. Also, the camera has delayed starting the recording so when I review playback, I am missing the first 30nseconds to minute and a half of my video.",
            "I bought this app a few years back. Paid the full price. Decided to download it again, and was disappointed to find out that they are trying to make me pay for it again, since they raised the price. If I already paid for it, why should I have to pay for it again. Essentially your phone will do all of this, that they offer, so will be deleting this. I refuse to pay for something I have already purchased. 🖕 Coach's Eye",
            "Great app, but no 120 fps, only 60, and can't trim your video after filmed. But that's ok, the better way to go is film the video(s) you want in your cell-phone's/tablet's video function at 120fps, then trim it, then import it. This app works with both Android and Apple/ios, Hudl only works w Apple/ios. After 'coaching' a video (marking up w voice instruction), processing speed seems pretty good, I haven't done a head-to-head comparison w Hudl, because I only use this. Highly recommend this.",
            "Only app out there I have found that has a timer built in to record how fast someone is running from point A to B. Other Apps have timers, but you can only use the timer while shooting the video. This App let's you upload videos you've already taken and use the timer from there. Great slow motion tool, too.",
            "The video feature is useful, the app is currently broken unfortunately. Exporting videos does not work, incredibly disappointing considering I paid $15 for the full version. Will be seeking a refund"

            "I love this app, I bought the full version and I really love that its not a subscription, just a one time payment. The only thing holding it back from 5 stars is that if you buy the full version on your phone, when you log into your account on the computer it doesn't carry over, and on a computer you need to pay for a monthly subscription in order to have access to the full version that is on your phone. If youre ok with only using your phone, the app is fantastic!",
            "Definitely the BEST way for my bass and guitar to be easier and inexpensive 5o me during coronavirus but, no in store drum instructor and yet it has the ability to do what olby specific games made by genius video game design / maker 2. So, songstert tabs and guitar chords will continue to be a one stop tab site I always fuel my desire to play my favorite song especially from the 90 hits no one seems to care about so I'm willing to spend $5,000 each morning noon and night to be a part of primus",
            "Love this app, it's helping me in a HUGE way - I read sheet music & this has it following along to each note via a vertical moving transparent bar, both DRUMS ONLY or with all music too. Good songs for sure! I would like it if song list was updated more often though please...AND ???? IF you guys create an alert upon opening App of songs added since last opened would be killer! Thanks, loving it & recommend! Also, may I please be added to Developer Beta versions please??",
            "Ok app, biggest problem is anybody can post tabs, so many tabs were right but I assume people can't play them so they try and make easier tabs which are completely wrong, needs a better post/change tab system, also wish they kept the previous version(was usually right).",
            "A great tool for learning or use for backing tracks. Was really pleased just utilizing basics then extremely pleased to discover Songstress can do so much more. Have recommend to friends."

I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "So, this game is very fun and worth the free download. But, unless you spend a bit of money to get some better cats, your going to be on some levels for a long time. I've been on the same lvl for probably about 2 months now. The level in question is revival of bahamut-cat (Sorry I dont know how to spell it), but its in that era, and I can't beat the final level. But other than some frustration, I've had quite a bit of fun with this game.",
            "The game is very good. It is very f2p friendly, allowing you you to get much of the premium currency without needing to pay. The people who say that the game is too pay to win because of one stage probably aren't playing the game right. Even without high tier units, you can still beat a level if you have strong enough units and have a good strategy. Overall good game",
            "I love this game, I really do. A lot of reviews for this game already talk about the great aspects it has and the many, many new and exciting updates it has to keep it fresh. But my only problem is the extra cat food the game says you get with any major purchase. Maybe it's just me, but after these purchases I have gotten zero of this promised cat food. I have gone on several times to try and reach Ponos, but I have never gotten a response.",
            "Ponos if you seeing this, I'm gonna tell you guys, this game is great to play in this quarantine but there's one thing troubling me, when I watch a couple of ads, in between those ads there's always a black screen so that's kinda annoyed me cause I need to restart the app but if you guys can fix it in the next update, that will be appreciated.",
            "This game is the best game I ever played from the app store!!!! There are legit ZERO complains from me about this game!!!! It only alight frusteraiting on the hard stages but that's okay! I really enjoy his game and the graphics! Keep up the amazing games and soon touight have just as many visits as adopt me does in roblox!!!! Everyone who is reading this, I recommend you get the game!! ( There are also zero ads!)"

            "Cute game, but I really don't like it when developers lock an accessibility feature such as dark mode behind a paywall. Perhaps they think it is just a cool feature and don't realise it is an accessibility one, but many people with chronic illnesses and disabilities suffer from light sensitivity (in my case ME/CFS). I don't feel I should have to pay all the time for a feature that would allow me to use an app without eye pain, like able-bodied people can.",
            "This game is great, I have nothing bad to say about it, which is so rare these days. Didn't even care when the 1st ad appeared, sadly it didn't load. This is one of the few games that truly deserves ads. You can see a lot of time and effort went into this. Top marks.",
            "cute little game with non invasive sounds and suitanle for children and kids at heart. yes there are ads but you can either buy or choose to not worry about. game doesn't seem to have any glitches. haven't chosen to buy yet but doesn't mean you shouldnt . reckon it will be worth it. they deserve the awards they have been given. congratulations!",
            "I- oh man. It's hard to find a mobile game of this caliber, it's hard to find ANY GAME of this caliber. This game knows exactly what it wants to do and does it RIGHT. I can tell that this is single-handedly one of the best if not the best mobile game ever, and I've only played it for like less than two minutes!",
            "It's a beautiful, meditative game that I get cought up in for hours . The graphics show the complexity of bubble lighting with a calm meditative environment. The behavior of the bubbles and puzzle components are very intuitive. I have only completed 3 areas and they have been relatively easy. I paid premium because I feel those involved with the game's creation are undervalued, especially when starting out. There are in app purchases but they can generally be earned by watching an ad instead."

I am very nervous and wondering. What did I get my self into?",

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",

This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

            "There is no strategy. Gather, do tasks, build. In the end the players that pay a lot of money have game buffs that cannot be earned. The designers deliberately degrade game performance at critical times requiring players to rebuild and thus spend more money to do it quickly. Update: It is obvious the developers do not test the operation of patches and new events. Each release has a fresh new list of bugs in the software and basic functionality doesn't work. Support is unable to resolve.",
            "Seems a little like it was alot to throw at me at the begging but once I figured it out it seems like its going to be a game I will stick with and get into for a good while. Visionary wise it looks way more amazing then it did on the pictures so anyone who tries for a first time. Well if your reading this review and you haven't downloaded it yet it's a game you will regret not downloading if you pass it up.. Great game only reason its not a 5 star is because I just haven't seen enough yet!",
            "So, it's an OK game for wallet warriors. Although stated in other reviews, one country in particular has a serious advantage, because the prices are high in other countries. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be ahead of anyone whilst not spending money. This game also takes about half an hr everyday just to get most of the free stuff. There's a countdown of 105 minutes to get all the free stuff.... Time waster if nothing else. Just make sure you aren't a big spender. You'll lose thousands here.",
            "After the major battlefield server merge I was left with my identity character name while all the levels that I had worked on earning for the past year and all my resources were reset back to zero with no instructions or notice on how to regain my resources my command center level was zeroed out from 24 to 0 what's the point if you're going to take everything from us that we've earned playing your game",

            "There are a lot of chest and abs workouts that can be done with resistance bands which are completely missing from the app. This has literally only 2 dedicated abs and chest workouts. Updating to Premium was a waste of money. Also, it would be much better if exercises are categorised in Shoulder, Back, Chest, Biceps, Triceps, Abs and legs categories so that it will be easier for us to create a custom workout of our own. The generalized upper body and lower body categories don't help much.",
            "Its a good app. My only concern is the fact that when you need to switch sides, there is no time given. Perhaps 5 - 10 secs per exercise to change over would be useful. Thanks.",
            "The app is easy to follow and if you are new to the resistance bands, it can provide you with plenty of exercises to do. However, the \" get ready\" time of 10 sec seems a bit too short. Plus, after a few weeks of usage, one gets bored of always having the same workouts. I'd suggest adding new workouts and allowing the user to set the \" get ready \" time manually . Also, lately there seems to be a glitch, when the app suddenly looses sound or stops responding. I hope that can be resolved.",
            "graphics are simple, clear ... audiovisual guide is comprehensive and well thought out. Users can understand and follow with ease",
            "It's dope, I use this as my exercise for the day - 20 minutes, rotating the 4 default workouts. I've noticed a difference in my body and the pain I used to get in my legs from the aftermath of my operations have gone, too. It asks you how the workout was at the end every single time and alters it for the next time you work out depending on what you said, which is amazing. Only downside is sometimes when you skip a certain exercise it'll skip to the exact same one until you can't skip anymore"

            "I love this app! My grandson absolutely loves playing this, there are so many learning tools in every game they have. If you want a great learning app for your littles I highly recommend Wonster Words, my grandson has been playing this app since he was two, he's now three and still loves it!",
            "This was much better when we first got it, 2-3 years ago. We have paid for the app. Biggest issue right now: I am really disappointed with the pop up request for a survey which you can only get rid of by agreeing to be redirected to a web page. You should be able to press around the box to get rid of it without being redirected but can't. My daughter is too old for it now, but my son still enjoys it. However, I think it now has LESS educational value than when we first got it and I am considering deleting the app. There are better apps out there if you want educational content. This is an ok app if you mostly want to distract the kid while they MIGHT learn something.",
            "Unimpressed; I see little educational value in this. I did the 7-day trial subscription, and all I see is repeated shape-matching - you don't really have to listen to the sounds or anything; it's just matching shapes. It basically just gives you an outline of a letter, you drag the matching letter to it, then it gives you another one. Am I missing something?",
            "This app is a fun way of learning soo many things especially phonics, alphabet and so on. This is so good my kids loves it a lot. They can't have enough of it at all times. Thanks to the developer 🤩🥳🤩",

Could there maybe be more skin colors, though? I have a unique olive skin color, and there aren't any super pale or super dark skin colors whatsoever. Still great 😁",
            "I love this app, I'm an Android user and I am very happy with the results. I get quick and easy access on many apps including messenger. My only problem is that I wish I could save my bitmojis like I can with the outfits I make. It would be very useful to me, please consider adding this to the app. (It would also be nice if there were more hairstyles and dresses)",
            "This app is great. There is a bitmoji for every occasion, it's loads of fun, full of expression. It is very hard to convey feeling, emotion etc across a text. People get there feelings hurt because they cannot hear the tone in your voice so a joke sometimes is taken seriously. Bitmoji has solved that. Bitmoji can convey your humor for you. Awesome job programmers of bitmoji. Also I love my avatar and the fact that I can adjust body size and hair color. Mine is always changing.",
            "Overall I like Bitmoji. However, the update that allowed me to have Friendmojis had me share my contact list. Bitmoji only took one number out of each named in my address book. In some cases, it took the wrong number. For example, if John Doe has a work number and a mobile number, Bitmoji took the work number, not the mobile number. This means I could not send a friend request to John's cell phone. When I removed the work number from one or two of my contacts, the list is not update in Bitmoji.",
            "This is a really great game! I totally reccomend it to you, When I downloaded the game, I was very happy with the results. Putting your bitmoji sticker is a very fun experience, they have a reminder(or I guess tutorial) on how to put a bitmoji sticker. The only reason why I'm putting 4 stars instead of 5 Is because of the art style, it's not a really big problem, it's still a great game! Try the game out, it's worth the download."

            "The app is great, really well developed games for kids to learn Spanish. My daughter loved every game . Certainly a good app if you are intending to teach a young one Spanish. The only downside is the hefty monthly price tag. You can simultaneously subscribe to three major TV streaming apps for the same monthly price of this app. I would continue using it if it was better valued. I have unfortunately unsubscribed.",
            "Whole Lotta fun, but why so short? My daughter is loved it, but my oldest in third grade blew through all 12 lessons in less than three weeks. We are glad you gave us a month free, but being that you hope to retain monthly subscriptions, it seems like there is no point in continuing to renew because we've already done the 12 short lessons.",
            "My 7 heard old daughter lives this program. It's fun and easy for her to use alone. I love hearing her say the words aloud and how easily she is picking up the Spanish vocabulary.",
            "It's easy for my kids to use (age 7 and 3) and they seem to retain more vocab with the game format than other apps I've tried",
            "This is a great game for my son whose bilingual preschool education is interrupted by the quarantine. We've played all the \"Color\" and \"Animal\" games so far - this is a VERY well designed game for young children. However, I wish you would take out the part in one of the games where an \"audience\" boos at the child if they get an answer wrong. My son was instantly jarred w/surprise to hear \"booing\" at him, and immediately became self-conscious & upset and didn't want to finish playing that part."

            "It has stopped working properly. If you are exercising outdoors and it has stopped working, even the steps stop being recorded. Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",

            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

            "Reduce the rate from 5 to 1. For the paid version you can customize your workout but you cannot back it up. So I open a ticket two months ago and no one contact with me !!!! Great app for TRX training. The only issue is the fact that the built-in training is for advanced. So for beginners or for anyone who want to custom his own training need to pay one time charge to get it. Now that I have my custom trainings it become great for me. The actual training can be synced to google fit.",
            "The worst training app I've ever used. 1- there is no way to skip the rest time to start the workout. 2- there is no progress bar, you don't know where in the training you are. 3- there is no pause, if you exit the app it restarts. 4- you can't tell if the timer is for rest or actual workout. 5- skipping an exercise is not quite clear. 6- can't go back to redo the exercise.",
            "Overall satisfied! Links to Google fit and the workouts are intense. Only problem is that I am using the full body workout and everytime the exercises are exactly the same, in the same order...",
            "Great app. Would be 5 stars if you could pause the workout to transition from hands to feet in straps. There's no warning so I always miss the first set trying to get my feet right.",
            "Great simple app with animated demos of each exercise and a good variety available. I tend to preview suggested workouts then pick the exercises suited to me so don't really know how the workouts themselves are, but very pleased with it for what I use it for. Could be improved with suggestions to make exercises easier or harder according to your level, but for a free app I'm certainly not complaining. More diverse models would be a huge improvement, currently only thin & muscular white bodies."

            "Much more than I expected. Very intuitive interface for learning quite a bit about the air quality. I've been using this for a month or so and pleased with the functionality, information and format. I'll give it 5 stars when I see an accurate forecast for poor air. So far it's been accurate for current air which of course is only moderately useful. This app leads into an ecosystem of products which they endorse and or make and market themselves. I'm considering buying a node to contribute.",
            "Wow, great air quality index (AQI) app. It's got a nice design, easy user interface, quick to understand and showing all important information in a digestible way. You can also keep track of your pollution exposure. The satellite map modelling pollution distribution is pretty high profile! What needs improvement is that the app should mention which standard is used, PM2.5 or PM10, which is most important. It's hidden in the option \"display main pollutant\".",
            "This app has been amazing when looking at the air quality outdoors in a snap! I would like to see more updates to the widgets, because the little and small widgets don't have a refresh button, so you can manually refresh the air quality number and see if it changed, but this app doesn't have that. Some more widget sizes and different designs would be great as well, but there are five already you can choose from. If you guys add the manual refresh button feature I will change my star rating to 5.",
            "I use this app daily as I live in a city with variable air quality and want to make sure my outside exercise time is spent in decent air. However, the map in the recent update is extremely poor: The +- option for zooming in has been removed which makes it more awkward to use. The map graphics are now terrible. It's hard to determine landmarks and zoom into the correct region of the map. Rivers are almost invisible and the grey background is a bad contrast making it harder to read.",
            "The app has gone downhill since the last Android update. Visual elements are low contrast and difficult to read. City names are tiny. Support is non-existent and ignores user feedback. Also, IQAir is taking Purple Air data but not validating it. During wildfires, it was obvious that indoor locations were being reported as outdoor locations because there was such a difference in their AQI readings vs other outdoor locations. Neither company would QC or clean up the data."

But, I have noticed that the younger is more for this game, because older one now wants to play escape games more, so Iwouldnvt agree wirh You. For developers: Thank you all very much for making it free. Most games like this are buy only or just part free. Great game made by a person that understands kids.",

            "My four year old and three year old love this game. The controls are easy and the ads aren't intrusive. Plus they are age appropriate. I bought the game regardless because it's very well done and worth the very reasonable price.",
            "Looked good, but alas this is obviously designed to just sell you DLC. It also shows you ads at pretty much every turn, which I don't want my son being subjected to. It lasted about five minutes before I had enough and uninstalled it."

I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ☹️ I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

            "Such a great & easy to use app. It's organised & kept me on top of all my medication intakes & I love the inspiring photos each day. Only 2 niggles I have is the reminder popping up over my navigation app whilst I'm driving (although I'm sure I can sort that if I look into my settings) & that I can't save those gorgeous daily pics to my gallery; I can only do it by screenshot but again, that's probably me not spending enough time figuring that out.",
            "UPDATE Actually getting WORSE. Loses everything. Wow get out of tracking RX if you can't make this accurate. Dangerous. Started OUT ok. However it loses track of input for mornings sometimes. So I record the medication time given along with symptoms I track. When I go back in evening for twice a day medications it will show nothing entered for morning on some days. TERRIBLE if accuracy is important. It has gotten worse lately, so maybe it doesn't work with the latest ver of ANDROID",
            "Great, but wish the symptom tracker had more. I'm using this to track my menieres medication and symptoms and it's not accommodated. It's not a rare disease, so unsure why. Please include tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo in symptoms. Or the ability to type in my own.",
            "Great remeinder app for my medications. i love the fact that it reminds you to take your meds, and the reminder doesnt go away until you check it off. i can be forgetful at times and this helps so much! Thanks for the great app",
            "Meditation list missing meds. Doesn't have a way to record insulin shots. Doesn't seem to have a way to print or email medication or dose info to my doctor. Really could use some sort of manual or built in instructions. I was hoping for more. Very disappointed."

            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",

            "Very fun game, but insanely expensive. Want to play single player? You have to pay for it. Want to upgrade your multi-player? You have to pay for it. Then there's the battle pass, premium pass, and thats not even getting to the pop ups after every game spamming you about other deals you can buy. The devs have something here, for the 1%.",
            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",
            "The game was great. Addictive. I am free player and been able to reach to lvl16 but the pain is to constantly watching ads. I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack. But still lots of fun. However this is definitely a pay to win game. Want you obtained Max rank all your characters you cannot continue to advance the upgrades without spending money"

Play a wizard, a succubus, a ranger, and a rogue in this epic series of text-based games.\r\n \r\nHere, old-school doesn’t mean primitive. There are hundreds of achievements to uncover—from the silly and surprising to the epic. As you make choices, stats go up and down, with rarely an “instant death”. You have ready options for going back on choices while gripping you with a sense of suspense and challenge.\r\n\r\n⚔️ SIMPLE, YET ADDICTIVE GAMEPLAY\r\nMedieval Fantasy RPG is dead-simple to learn, yet hard to master. You read and make choices, that’s it, but the consequences of your choices are not always obvious.\r\n\r\nIt's like a series of your favorite fantasy novels, but gamified to be even more awesome!\r\n\r\nSoon you will be immersed in an RPG richer than any you have played before because your own imagination is driving what you see, hear, and touch.\r\n\r\n⚔️ PLAY A MASSIVE, WELL-THOUGHT-OUT STORY!\r\nThis huge series of intertwining story lines is made up of over 1 MILLION words! Over 7 years has gone into the development!\r\n \r\nYou start off playing a character in search of glory and loot, but soon delve into a world of deadly conspiracy and parallel universes. Later, the story continues as you switch to playing a succubus (demon), and then a rogue—each with their own personality and goals.\r\n\r\nAlso, there’s more on the way! Like a good D&D campaign, it doesn’t end.\r\n\r\n⚔️ ACTUALLY FREE AND NO PAYING FOR A CHOICE\r\nPlay well and you will be rewarded with the currency you need to finish everything without spending a penny. Hunt down those achievements, get the high ranks, and choose to watch the rewarded videos as they become available. Not that I don’t appreciate your monetary support and I’m confident that you will find it well worth it, but know that you do not have to.\r\n\r\nUnlike many choice-based games, you do NOT spend currency to make choices. No choice is walled off from you for need of gems, etc. nor is there any such hint to spoil which is the “better choice”. You choose!\r\n\r\n⚔️ REAL ROLE-PLAYING\r\nTo succeed, you must put yourself in the boots of your character and do what’s best for him or her, even if it’s not what you would normally do. This requires more than logic, but also empathy for your character and the situation he/she finds themselves in. This is role-playing in its purest form.\r\n\r\n⚔️ EASY ON BATTERY AND STORAGE. EVEN PLAY OFFLINE!\r\nAlthough this is a huge interactive story, offering many hours of enjoyment, it’s a tiny download and you can even play offline.\r\n\r\n⚔️ Origin\r\nGot this far? Well, let me tell you about the origin of this game. My name is Sam. I grew up with Dungeons and Dragons (1st edition, yeah!) and Choose Your Own Adventure books in rural Wisconsin, a place where imagination offered the most expedient means of escape. Decades later, I wanted to see if I could combine the best of fantasy writing with mobile game design in order to make reading addictive. Over six years ago, I left my corporate job to embark on a quest to create the best Interactive Fiction package I could. Over those years, I’ve been working full-time in my backyard shed striving to keep on the right side of sanity as I drift off into other worlds. This isn’t quite as sad as it sounds. My shed is insulated against Seattle’s winter chill, I invested in a standing desk, and my monitor is pretty sweet. I’ve had help from contractors over the years, which has been a lifesaver, particularly for art which I'm hopeless with.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the fruits of my obsession and maybe I’ll hear from you via mail, etc. People like you make the sacrifice, the isolation, and the ups-and-downs of the brutal mobile business worth it. :)",

            "Overall pretty fun and interesting. I've only gotten through Wizard's Choice 3 but I'm looking forward to finishing the story + trying out other ones! It's cool how drawings are sometimes implemented. Something I dislike is the fact that sometimes your choices really don't matter other than deciding your survival on a pre-set storyline. I'm also curious about something that shows up when looking at achievements. It says something about 'signs of life' and I'm just confused about what it means?",

It's addictive and I love the story line with the choices I get to make. It reminds me of those choice decision making story books I loved to read as a child. I would compare to D& D but I've never actually played. If it's like this, I know I'd enjoy that game too. Good job.🙆 😳Maybe I'll get to be a necromancer 🧠💭🔌",
            "At time of writing I have played through the first 2 wizard stories. The writing is really good and the depth of characters is interesting, definitely engaging stories. I am docking 2 stars because for such a heavy aspect of choice, the stories are basically linear. The stories are enjoyable but your choices don't matter in the sense of getting different endings or having any real effect. If you make a wrong choice, you will get railroaded onto the correct one with maybe losing certain stats.",
            "I like the game, as it really reminds me of a D&D campaign (without the dice rolls). The only major issue I have is the amount of 5-second ads. When the campaign gets deep or when it's not going well, the frequent pop-up ads can take away any excitement that built up or add to the frustration. I get the need for ads, but just prepare yourself for their frequency.",
            "I played the first chapter of the Wizard's Choice and it was a fun little adventure. This is more of a choose your own adventure book than D&D equivalent, but for free it's nice. The few game mechanics on top of the story choices are nice, but not complex in any way, just makes this more game like, rather than strictly a story you are reading. There are ads every now and then, but the autoplay ones are short. For a free game is definitely worth checking out."

            "Again with update i apparently don't need. Can we fix this? It's becoming a pain... I keep getting a notice to upgrade but when I click OK, it just takes me to Google Play and there is no update option. All I can do is open.",

You define the time of the workout, the videos help a lot, exercises are varied and work all of the body. I will definitely stick with this one for a long while. And the premium subscription is very convenient. Good job!",
            "Works fine for what I need it for. Working out without doing the hard work of manually creating a routine. They're ready set all i have to do is adjust the time I want to spend and what part of the body I want to work. Perfect!",
            "Really good, and allows you to determine intensity and length of workout, AND say how you found your workout so that next time it's automatically easier/harder for you. And you can play music in the background whilst using it 😁. Would be better if it sent you a daily reminder/had a scheduling tool incorporated into it.",
            "Jesus! This app drills you.. I'm certain you can achieve results in just weeks.. You get to choose the time you want to work out for and it just keeps the exercises rolling in for that time frame.. Really intense (even though basic exercises) and great.",
            "Great, just started using it 3 days ago and already I feel change, I was weight lifting for about a month which came really great with this app. I have more energy, doing exercises that I wasn't able to do before. Maybe it will take more than a month, they say : It takes 4 weeks for you to see, 8 weeks-for your friends to noticeand 12 weeks for whole world to see. Just when it's hard and you want to give up DON'T, because that is when changes are happening. 👍👍👍👍👍"

            "I am a paid subscriber of tinybeans and have been using it for about 8 months. It can be a bit janky with uploading but it worked for its purpose and I loved the calendar function. I am very disappointed that the app was removed from the app store for almost 2 months with little to no communication from tiny beans, only a brief \"faq\" mention on their website if you looked for it. I don't recommend paying for this service when this is how they treat paying customers.",
            "Uploading is much easier but now I'm not able to see any recent notifications. My phone tells me someone liked a picture but when I get to the app the most recent notification is from over a month ago. It won't allow me to see who has liked or commented on anything. I've uninstalled, reinstalled and restarted my phone. No luck still. We love this app and love being able to share pictures and videos with family back home but since the new update it crashes everytime I try to add new pictures 😞",
            "It started out as a great way for my parents in law living 12hrs away to stay connected to what's happening with our baby. Now the whole family use it because it's so easy to share photos & stories to one PRIVATE place. Downside - poor quality of the photos. I'm sure my fam don't notice how pixelated the images are. So dissapointed considering I pay premium & I intended to buy printed albums too but won't due to the poor image quality EDIT* Thx for clearing up the the hi res Q around printing",
            "Love this app ! My family all over the country have had it all the time .The grandbaby has been on it since she was born,& her parents have had pics up every week. It's fun to see the flashbacks too ! Easy to add pics and comments !",
            "About 1 out of every 5 pictures I try to upload actually upload to my account. I just tried Uninstalling the app and re-installing and am still having issues. I have an android phone which may be the issue (my friend with Apple has no issues with this app)"

            "Day 4 and loving this app!! I love that I can listen to my own music while using the workout. The workouts are spot on! I'm sure it's just because I just started, my only suggestion wouldukd be to show a quick animation between moves, or que as to what is next. Sometimes I am scrambling to quickly move into the next one. I imagine as I keep going I'll just know what each move is though. So awesome!!",
            "I love Jillian, she pushes you while motivating you. This app is great, it has a ton of variety and you can modify to whatever equipment you have and for your fitness level. With that being said, I only gave 3 stars because the app is glitchy. For something I have to pay for, I'm disappointed that so many things don't work well. I'm leaving this review today because I just finished a workout in which majority of the videos didn't work so I didn't exactly know what to do. Please fix this.",
            "There have been a few issues with the app, but the support always replies fast and is working on solving them and improving the performance. Thank you! Great app. So many programs to choose from, the exercises are so good and excellent advice about food and healthy diet with many recipes. I would highly recommend. This app is a life changer.",
            "I love the variety this app offers and I'm a fan of Jillian's style of workouts. I've knocked off a star for a few reasons, though. There are glitches, including one I encounter at least once a week in which I skip to the last cooldown exercise and it resets the whole workout like I never did it. That is very frustrating. Even more annoying is that now the volume of my music changes during the workout. I found this distracting and I could barely hear it most of the time, then it becomes loud.",
            "Love the app, have been using is for 4 mos now! I like the different exercise options and meal plans. It is nice that there are beginner option exercises, too. I love the new beginner yoga! There is also a calendar to track your progress. There have been a few random days where the app freezes and gets glitchy but overall I think its a good, useful app!"

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

            "As someone who has seen the many facets of Keen, I would never recommend the app to anyone. I have the advisors that I like on my email and I request private readings now. No disrespect to the advisors, but Keen is a money-grabbing app that takes too much of a commission from the advisors and gives too little back to the \"valued\" patrons. The staff is very rude to customers as well. I would rather give the advisors 100% of the proceeds than feed a corrupt company.",
            "It charged me to payment's of $40 for no reason the sessions are extremely short and not worth 2mins for $10 when the person reading you is typing for the whole 2mins.",
            "Ridiculous, got charged $99 and got no reading, spent 6 minutes waiting for a reply, have emailed about a refund and got no response, total rip off. I'm in Ireland so calling customer support its not an option to waste more money.",
            "The app is great but were is the button to send message to an advisor? I think who ever programed this app forgot to include that feature.",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

            "Have been using this app for a few weeks now- EXCELLENT sounds for sleep- BUT- as I set the alarm to shut off it wakes me back up. Now the app keeps appearing on my screen in the middle of the day- annoying. So, it was good for a little while but I will keep searching and will have to uninstall to get some sleep. Thanks anyway, you tried.",
            "Have been using it for a while now. It's staggering how much the app has improved within little time. The sound quality and the UI is amazing and most importantly everything works perfectly for free. Truly amazing work by the devs.",
            "I love it really didn't thank would work so many enjoyable things to choose from take your mind to good memories and helps you to really relax so very thankful I found it, still using it , used many of the different things it offers and still not disappointed works for me even on some nights that am having a lot of trouble sleeping from pain or restlessness I turn it on pick out what I want to hear and off to a restful sleep I go I really enjoy it a lot have recommended it to family and friends",
            "I really love this app and I've been using it to sleep and relax recently! I would love for it to have timers for less minutes like 5, 10, 15 as the current shortest is 30 mins and for it to have an alarm for when the time is over so that it can be used for short naps.",
            "Update: took a while, but Finally sleeping more than a few minutes here and there. The 45 minute sleep meditation helps big time. Having Fibromyalgia makes sleep near impossible. Even when taking a sleeping pill, it doesn't help all the time. Despite the fact that I still don't get much sleep, my body is resting more than before using this app. If I can shut down completely and get a solid 60 minutes of sleep, I'll be raising it up to a full 5 stars (posting this at 1AM EDT)."

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "We were gifted our first Hatch sound machine, and loved it so much we purchased a second. I love the variety in sound and light settings, as well as the ability to easily set your favorites and create timed programs. For example, we use it as a wake up clock for our kids. We set the light red when they should be in bed and it turns green when it's time to get up. 10/10 would recommend for children or adults! App is easy to use and navigate, even with multiple machines.",
            "I Iove the concept, but the app isn't intuitive. The sound library is minuscule! It's over saturated with meditations and it's lacking a lot of the classic sounds people would like falling asleep to. No cat purring? No thunder? Supposedly with premium, for $50 dollars a year, you get access to this ever expanding library of sounds. Where is that? I certainly don't see it. Signed up for premium because the sound library was lacking and nothing changed. Not a single thing. Waste of money.",
            "Great app, love the vast selection of mood colors to choose from as well as the customizable programs. I use it for red light (to help induce sleep) and rain sounds to come on every night at 9pm and my 2 month old seems to enjoy it. Deducted 1 star because when the time comes for the noise and light to shut off, the sound doesn't fade into silence nicely. Instead it abruptly shuts off and you're left with a weird feeling of \"It's quiet...too quiet\"",
            "The Hatch sleep is amazing! Very easy to use and my daughter loves it. She falls asleep quicker and longer. She also love watching the colors change. What's great about the Hatch is you can use it for more than baby. I use the rain or waterfall option while I meditate and when I practice yoga or if I just need to wind down after a long day's work. My husband loves it too. He has such a hard time sleeping at night with the Hatch he sleeps faster as well! So much so that we had to buy another one!",
            "I love hatch sleep! We have it set to turn on for certain things such as bathtime, nap time and sleep and wake time. My baby is only 2 months old so she doesn't quite understand what each sound and color mean but if we're consistent with it she will eventually. Very simple to use and customizable. Look forward to using the sleep and wake time when she gets older!"

You need to interact with your fish and feed it to keep them healthy. Your fish CANNOT die. Tank cleaning is no longer in the app. This app is about taking care of and interacting with your fish. If you are not patient or just want some worthless achievement from the appstore then its not an app for you. This is realistic fish and beautiful graphics.",

Thanks to the creator of this game I hope you can add more kind of fishes 🤗 By the way guys I have 3 fishes now and Im so very happy 😊",
            "Loved it in the beginning. Now now new babys and every time the chest of gold just disappears. Basically I can only feed them, cant access water decorastions and no prizes or rewards. Same ol same ol every day When will you fix my app? Cant even access what I've earned. Sadly I love my fish and want more.... more fish, more options, ability to access. Is anyone there??? Hello? Great app but seems to stop new things once you have 3 fish. I want MORE this app could offer. ???????",
            "I LOVE this apk! Remember MOPy Fish from the late '90s? Yeh, I had that. But it can't be run on Windows 10. This is a wonderful substitute. My Fishy is happy, healthy & loves me back as well. Good job, developers!",
            "I love this app. It really does emulate an aquarium and it does it so well! At first you start with 1 fish, gravel and food and you unlock elements as you visit your fish. It is really well done and I usually leave my phone on the app, just watching the fish and plants move around. Very relaxing"

        "description": "The app has1500 voiced flashcards in English and several educational games: \"Find a Picture\", \"Coloring\", \"Puzzles\", \"Find a Word\", etc. Also additional sounds (such as animal voices) and short videos. Children really like to watch these interactive flashcards, and they do not lose interest in learning.\r\n\r\nFlash cards are an easy and interesting way for your child to recognize the world around them. Approved worldwide by child psychologists, teachers and parents themselves, flash cards are ideal for very young children and those up to 7 years of age! \r\n\r\nFlash cards for Development. \r\n\r\nDuring a child’s formative years, developmental cards are almost a necessity, and not just for entertainment. Flashcards are great for games and just starting conversations with your child. Plus they’re great fun!\r\n\r\nIt’s long been known that the key to developing a child’s intellectual abilities is their personal perception and experiences during the first five years of life. By showing your child these cards, you’ll: \r\n\r\n• Stimulate brain activity \r\n• Better develop your child’s logical thinking \r\n• Improve their memory and attention span \r\n• Develop reading skills faster than their peers \r\n\r\nIt’s easy to teach your child with these cards and regular studies are essential. \r\n\r\nA Proven Approach\r\n\r\nStart playing with your child by showing them flashcards three times a day. Do one or two sections at a time and for just 2-3 seconds for each card.

Flashcards are great for games and just starting conversations with your child. Plus they’re great fun!<br><br>It’s long been known that the key to developing a child’s intellectual abilities is their personal perception and experiences during the first five years of life. By showing your child these cards, you’ll: <br><br>• Stimulate brain activity <br>• Better develop your child’s logical thinking <br>• Improve their memory and attention span <br>• Develop reading skills faster than their peers <br><br>It’s easy to teach your child with these cards and regular studies are essential. <br><br>A Proven Approach<br><br>Start playing with your child by showing them flashcards three times a day. Do one or two sections at a time and for just 2-3 seconds for each card.

Also, you can't check out reminders from the notifications, you have to open the app and you have to do it from the menu, not clicking on the notification",

I've been trying to set a unique notification tone for the App. So I can tell the Reminders apart from Emails and Texts etc. I want the reminders to actually get my attention, I tend to ignore the ones that are set for Emails and VM's and stuff because I know they are likely pointless. Any way I haven't been able to get the custom sound options in the settings menu to work. Every test I've tried Has only set off my Default Notification tone. Don't know if I'm doing something wrong or if its a bug. Can I get a Hand with this please??? UPDATE Figured It out!!! Great App",
            "Good working... but stops reminding after a bit. Also they have the wierdest pets like Maccaws, spiders, Jerboas(look that one up)but it won't let me make a duck profile! I WANT A DUCK PIC. Even Jerboas are supposed to be wild and never ever have i heard of a Jerboa being a pet!",

            "Just wanted this app for the scheduling of training sessions but I hate notifications as it was used to keep track of the number of sessions, not the time they needed to be. Could not turn off notifications. Even went into my actual phone settings and disabled it and the notifications still came through. Uninstalled in 2 days."

        "description": "Do you want to have a perfect posture and healthy spine? You can get it with simple and fast exercises.\r\nPerfect Posture app will help you to exercise at home without the need of any equipment.\r\n\r\nWhy is good posture important?\r\nGood posture helps us stand, walk, sit, and lie in positions that place the least strain on supporting muscles and ligaments during movement and weight-bearing activities. \r\n\r\nBenefits of correct posture:\r\n* Reduced low back pain\r\n* Fewer headaches\r\n* Increased energy levels\r\n* Less tension in your shoulders and neck\r\n* Decreased risk of abnormal wearing of the joint surfaces\r\n* Increased lung capacity\r\n* Improved circulation and digestion\r\n* Easier and deeper breathing\r\n* Healthy spine\r\n* Decreased risk of scoliosis\r\n* Decreased risk of osteoporosis\r\n* Decreased risk of thoracic outlet syndrome\r\n* Decreased risk of many posture related problems\r\n\r\nCan I correct my posture?\r\nIn a word, yes. Remember, however, that long-standing postural problems will typically take longer to address than short-lived ones, as often the joints have adapted to your long-standing poor posture. Conscious awareness of your own posture and knowing what posture is correct will help you consciously correct yourself. With much practice, the correct posture for standing, sitting, and lying down will gradually replace your old posture. This, in turn, will help you move toward a better and healthier body position.\r\n\r\nApp Features:\r\n* 125 back and shoulder exercises\r\n* 30 days challenge to maintain perfect posture\r\n* Workout duration from 2 to 24 minutes - depend on difficulty you choose\r\n* Full offline support\r\n* Voice Coach\r\n* HQ Video tips\r\n* Dark mode\r\n* Cloud synchronization\r\n* Google fit synchronization\r\n* BMI calculation\r\n* Burned calorie statistics\r\n* Daily reminders\r\n* Articles about maintaining good posture and healthy spine\r\n\r\nThe app also provides additional Plans and Exercises, such as:\r\n\r\n* Morning, Afternoon and Evening plans\r\n* 2 and 4 minute warm ups\r\n* Back Pain & Stiffness workouts\r\n* Workouts at work\r\n* Anti-stress workouts for mood and confident\r\n* Challenges\r\n* Relaxation workouts\r\n* Scoliosis workouts\r\n\r\nApp is also for people:\r\n* Who wants to have healthy spine\r\n* Who wants to reduce lower or upper back pain\r\n* Who has to sit long time in work or home\r\n* Who wants to reduce stress level\r\n* Who wants to stretch upper and lower body\r\n* Who wants to have good healthy body\r\n* Who wants to fix forward head posture\r\n* Who wants to stop progressing or fix scoliosis\r\n* Who wants to stop progressing or fix osteoporosis\r\n* Who wants to stop progressing or fix thoracic outlet syndrome\r\n\r\nApp supported languages:\r\n* English\r\n* Russian\r\n* Italian\r\n* Spanish\r\n* German\r\n* French\r\n* Portuguese\r\n* Japanese\r\n* Chinese simplified\r\n\r\nThanks for reading all the way to the end.

            "Love this app! Very simple, in expensive and it works. I'm on day 15 now and I look and feel much less hunched over",
            "I enjoy this app, its set up in a simplistic manner which makes it easy to use. The duration time for stretches are just right for each phase. Its nice that there is a calendar to keep track of your progress. Not too sure is calories burned is correct since every person is different, but still a good motivation tool. Morning, Afternoon and Evening is a plus as is multiple other categories ."

            "The entire game is a \"pay to win\" nightmare... It is designed to artificially limit your progress in as many ways as you can think of. You cant upgrade your units without \"shards\" which are completely random. Worse, there is also an insultingly low \"daily gold limit.\" Gold is also required to make any upgrades. Worse, if you try to fight without leveling up, you will actually LOSE all of your hard earned progress. THE ONLY WAY TO WIN THIS GAME, IS TO NEVER PLAY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!",
            "Normally I don't like these types of games (auto battlers), but this is actually the first one that I've enjoyed. The game has quite a bit of strategy to it and oozes quality. The monetization system is questionable of course, it's pay-to-win and that is why I will not spend any money on it (I would happily have had the game as a premium title instead) and the game will get old quite fast for me because of that. But for now it is quite fun.",
            "Its a expensive game and you will not win if you never pay that why i notice. The winning rate will totally drop and you will done nothing once you stop spending. Gain no experience as well when loosing in the season pass. They will give just a star for wagon which will take 4 to 8 hours. You will enjoy playing at first but will loose interest in the long run",
            "Great game, I've been playing for a couple of months now without spending a cent. Quite playable without paying, although progess is slow after reaching certain level. Good variety of units but simple enough to relax and enjoy. Also you choose if you want to watch adds for resources. My only complaint is that, lacking resources, it is difficult to upgrade units, and therefore change strategies, once you are at a certian level. But overall a great game!",
            "Update fail. Game now crashes immediately after the 1st splash screen. Anyway it's just a cash grab. The now rampamt \"battle pass\" last barely a week & doesnt grant enogu to be worth buying even if it lasted a month or more like most others do. No real strategy, just whoever buys the most, wins & no real game as combat is entirely automated."

            "This is such, and STILL a great game. The reason for this is airplane mode. This gets rid of all ads an snakes gameplay less laggy. The huge selection of guns and weapons is pretty good. The bosses are nice, and everything in it is amazingly incredible. Overall I made this page to tell you to use airplane mode and get the creator more positive reviews. But still get rid of some ads. Thank you. 😉",
            "I love this game a lot but when I beaten the bosses in the first ten maps then relaunch the app when I come off it, some of the bosses reset for no reason and I have to keep beating them up again and again. These bosses that reset are on map three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. Can you fix this bug please. P. S. Thank you for changing all of the bosses into humans again.",
            "Its so sad that this game sold out. Used to be an amazing game. Now there are UNSKIPPABLE ADs everywhere. It was one of my favourite games, and is now awful to endure. When the option pops up to watch an add to \"double the reward\" whether you choose to double it or not you will STILL have to watch an add as it plays automatically regardless of the button you press. Some of these ads even have a function where they reroute you out of the app and straight to the googleplay download page. Awful",
            "The game was fun at first until it started lagging and glitching out on me. The screen goes black every five minutes and sometimes the boss will disappear from the screen completely making me restart the app. And if there's more than ten maps it won't let me scroll through the rest of them. It only shows maps 1 through 10."

These are the only problem among other things all the remaining are perfect.",

However, that set of functions is not advertised by this app. Giving it a full 5 stars because it does exactly as advertised, and with a bonus dark background option. It integrates conveniently into the popup bar which appears when a word is selected and highlighted.",

Fingers crossed! Update: App external bookmark feature seems to be back. But now app has issues with freezing when bookmarking or marking selections.",
            "FIXED NOW. From 1 to 5 stars **FETCH FROM CLIPBOARD IS NOT WORKING.** In samsung ONE UI2 with android 10 (Samsung TAB A) the fetch from clipboard feature (much loved) is not working and it increases the amount of time spend for searching for a word. Please check if it can be fixed by an update. I love the app but this is going against now."

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemic🤍 God Bless🤍"

I was pretty happy with my progress but I got a question wrong then it took me back to 84 points. The worst part is that I was almost at 100 points and it took some time. You will have to spend at least half an hour to finish a single lesson, seriously? I was about to break my computer. This app isn't the best learning app. I prefer clever instead.",
            "I have ben doing it for many years and i hate it. I understand it is supposed to help is learn but the point sistem makes that almost imposible. I have ben left in tears after getting to 90 and then loosing 10-20 points. You only get a few points for getting one right. The person who made it had good intent but is hated by every kid who is forced to use it.",
            "I can't really say much about the actual math and learning stuff about this app. My problem is with the point system. You earn 1 or 2 points every time you get a question correct, but lose about 10-20 points when you get one wrong. It's extremely frustrating and stressful to have to keep redoing everything because of a few small mistakes and the amount of times I've cried while doing this is embarrassing, so having a little kid doing this probably isn't a good idea.",
            "IXL pls improve the score count because if you go to the 90's sometimes it give you two scores to go up and sometimes one score to go up, but when you get something wrong it will be 10 or 5 6 7 8... and so on down and it will be frustrating to the people who tried their best to finish the problems and when they get it wrong they will want to stop, but some people get forced to finish, wich is not fair in my opinion, so can you pls fix this problem. Thank you.",
            "Honestly, it is one of the worst apps ever made. Because of it my stress levels fly when I get something wrong since it minuses like 20 when you get one wrong. I've cried many times about it. If you want to not ruin the lives of many students please put the minus scoring lower. Or you will be one of the lowest rated apps."

            "Loved this game back on pc as a teen . Got the modern one on phone. For what it is this game is brilliant. The only problem is no matter the doll or level the objective is to hit as many points as possible. It gets real boring real quick. Still it's a nice little teabreak tickler.",
            "It's a very nostalgic game with great a concept but it gets boring after 10 minutes I would recommend adding even a few more levels. Even though you probably won't because there's no point as there isn't really much more you can gain from it but it's about the feelings!",
            "Game was great but turbo dismount was better, gave 3 stars because you don't many characters to pick from, not a lot of free maps (only 4) and you can't add obstacles also if you add body dismemberment it would be better but anyways great game keep up the good work",
            "I love this app. Reminiscent of games played in my childhood. I chose the paid version and have had nothing but fun with it. Wickedly enjoyable to put the face of someone you dislike on the doll and then push it down the stairs, off a building, or down a mountain. The only thing that would improve it would be to leave some kind of splat, and a grunt or groan, at each point the doll impacts. Perhaps add the Wilhelm Sound when the doll gets pushed.",

            "First of all, I frickin love the aesthetics!! I love foxes so much and the layout is just- <3 The sounds are amazing and once I get something hooked up I'll get the other sounds! I'm especially fond of the ones that have to do with water... I'm weird, lol. I hope there are more sounds added soon!!! I am not deleting this app for a long while, it helps me to sleep!! I totally recommend :3 Sounds of nature comfort me. This is the best app I've come across so far! Say goodbye to the fan in my room! Again, totally recommend!!! Go at it, person who made this app! I support your project whole heartedly!",
            "Very good but it can be improve by adding more sound of nature, Like some soft sweet birds tone. The piano🎹 tones are nice, I suggest cool guitar🎸 tones should be included in the next update so as to best complete it usage for all age categories. Once these are included, this app will be the highest rated and downloaded of its kind. One more advice from me is that once your aim is achieved, don't let much advert to downgrade your stars, 🌟 I wish you the very best of luck.",
            "A very lovely app!! I'm quite wary about giving apps certain permissions, but this one has very much gained my trust. It's has zero ads and plays while the screen is off. It uses free audio, so some of it may not be of the highest quality, but I still personally find it wonderful, as it can play in the background while using other apps. And of course the blue light reducing festure is fantastic and has saved my eyes lmao. Overall this is a wonderful app! 10/10 would recommend. 💖💕💕",
            "No ads, wonderful sounds and music, background changes, blue light filters... what more do you want? Hands down helps me sleep. Accidentally leave it on? It stays on all night. That, personally, is amazing. I'm so happy with this, and you should get it! Sweet dreams~🌙",
            "I use this app to help me sleep, and I find it to be very effective, soothing and peaceful. My favourite choice is the ocean waves/tide option. I really like that it plays for the duration of sleep hours, ie 7-8 hours overnight without interruption. I also really like the night light filter option. Thank you for creating and sharing this.

And the big part of the fun is making little movies with this to impress your family and friends. I cannot recommend this until they fix this feature.",
            "It's ok, but it cant record any images/video and this problem has been on-going since April 2020. There is not a whole lot you can do with app and that is a shame, because it has so much potential. With the paid bundle, you can look at each dinosaur, but you cant learn from it - no information on the species. No function settings - you cant reduce/enlarge each dino, you cant have all dinosaurs together in the park/ar. C'mon guys, you can do better than this!",

Still nothing seems to have moved forward much and it looks like they've given up all together on something they had working then apparently updated with broken code, And here we are. I appreciate and I'm sure everyone else appreciates your short term teaser. I will be certain to watch closely for your label on other software to avoid, and waste no time with. WoW - WoW",

It was a tad hard to pluck the hair but it made it a lot more fun. I'd recommend this game if you like relaxing stuff, unless you hate plucking hairs. The arm and hair is fine but everything else has a bit of black on it though if i had to knock it on anything it would be that. Thank you for reading this!",
            "It's kinda weird you pull out hairs and it's about emotions. The graphic is terrible but that adds to the feeling of this app and the voice is so endearing. This whole app is endearing. It feels like your pure friend trying to cheer you up with cheesy remarks and jokes. Sorry I can't give you guys any money but keep it up. Also, no ads at all.",
            "For me its hard to find games like this and i love games that are different for popular games and games that most people know about. But this game is super cool i know it might seem like you just plucking hair but its actually a really nice game so i hope you guys enjoy it as much ad i do.",
            "I thought this game was very creative and calming to play, it was a short game, but a very enjoyable game, and i loved the voice it was very funny to hear and helped to convey what they were saying!!! I also love how there were no ads, except for maybe twice the entire game to ask me to donate, so they can continue with no ads!!! So thus game is definitely amazing!!!",
            "Game seems broken. Very first thing to do and it doesn't work. Colored point to tap appeared, tapped it, then I couldn't do anything. Couldn't pull down, couldn't pinch with two fingers like the image showed, nothing but move it to one side."

            "Ok I don't even care anymore. This is honestly a great game. But tone it down with the forced ads a bit. And the tranquilizer darts are too annoying. Nerf them please. And also, I think you should add at least these things. 1. Add a drill weapon for the normal vehicle. (Not the ultimate ones.) 2. Make it so you get 3 - 20 free gems every day. (I will love you if you do this.) last one. Add mythic and secret rarity parts. Mythic chances: 0.01383% Secret chances: 0.0000112% (add mythic boxes too.)",
            "I am a prestige 60 player. Played this game over a year to achieve that. Watch all the ads everyday. I am a gang leader as well. But since the day they introduce the purple darts, which makes players with them almost invincible. This whole game becomes a very uneven playing ground. Of the developer is not going to make playing this game fair. I will petition to get a lot of players to forever quit playing this game. Very dissapointed that I wasted one over years on you.",
            "Played this game for 1 and a half years. By the time they introduced the tranquilizer darts, the game becomes medium to EXTREMELY HARD. LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT ANYONE WITH IT. AND HOW CAN ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HAS IT!? CAN'T ADVANCE TO PRESTIGE 5 WITHOUT PLAYING THIS GAME FOR MONTHS!! very disappointed in you, C. A. T. S. At least nerf the gun. Reduce the stun time from five seconds to two, maybe. Help me out here because THIS IS THE EIGHTH WEEK OF TRYING TO ADVANCE TO STAGE 23.",
            "I'm hooked, my son is hooked, my daughter is hooked. Genuinely the best mobile game I've played. The adds were a bit intrusive in the beginning, but it is a free game after all and the gameplay kept me coming back regardless. After a few days I payed to remove them. Lets face it, the developers deserve support for such an excellent game. **Edit 27/10/20: they've added a couple of items (tranquiliser gun I'm looking at you!) that have horribly unbalanced the game, ruining the fun completely.",
            "I've played this game for like 2 or more years. Darts destroyed the gameplay even though I've got two from the grand prix. It just narrows down the game and downgrades it to less creative levels. Also, I think that I'm closest ever to deleting the game from my device at this point."

            "Definitely what I needed. Waking up to this alarm is alot easier than hitting snooze several times before actually getting out of bed. Using this I'm actually fully awake by the time I set my alarm to get out of bed. The interface seems strange to me, but there is a video when u first open it to show you how to use it.",
            "Tried this for a week and there are too many bells and whistles for me. I'm just looking for calm alarm tones so I don't wake up miserable in this hellhole of 2020. Also, while I get ads, a whole page Facebook ad as soon as you wake up is the opposite of calm. Also, it doesn't save settings easily, so if I go in to change the time of an alarm, I have to also set every little thing back to my liking. Too much for me,but clearly works for others so give it a try to see if it fits.",
            "Exactly what ive been looking for One problem though is that, whenever my phone is below 20%, the no-sound, light-only alarm i set up at sunrise sounds VERY loudly. I use an old phone as alarm clock so its battery sometimes drains. I'd like for it to simply not ring and let the battery empty (like, make it be my choice)",
            "Mornings are so much easier! I'm not hitting snooze AT ALL. I can't imagine waking up to a shocking, obtrusive alarm sound ever again. I have recommended it to coworkers and friends. Why isn't everyone using this alarm??? Great app, thanks Gentle Wakeup!",
            "Has helped curve my terrible snooze habit, and waking up is definitely a better experience. Bought all the features, just for liking the free version so much."

            "I have been a user of this app for over 10 years. I am a huge fan but, while I appreciate your need to create revenue, the addition of ads that play sound before you even get to the ad is simply infuriating, and is leading me to consider uninstalling. I really do not want to do this, but I cannot fathom how you thought this was in any way a good idea. Please remove the ads with sound. Honestly, get rid of this garbage or watch this die. \"We try to limit these ads\" like hell you do. Lip-service",
            "One of my most used apps, one of the only ones that puts a smile on my face (most of the time). The ads arnt too bad, all except the ones that plays music and is animated. Whoever allowed those to pop up and dissables my music or youtube running on the background has a special place in hell for them 🙂🖕",
            "The app functions well, but half the memes are political and not very funny. I would love to use this app, but I am uninstalling it because I don't look at memes to hear endless political views. I think myself and the majority of users want the moderator to accept less political memes and more that are funny to everyone, regardless of their polictical preference. Otherwise, a filter option would be helpful to sort through categories of memes and avoid political ones.",
            "Epic app, except for august 1st, but there is something im not happy with on it, every now and then on gallery it will only show memes from august 1st (on august 1st every meme gets past moderation) and it kinda sucks since august 1st memes usually suck",
            "Was a great app loved it untill recently when the added ads which were easy to pass over untill a few days later when the ads started playing music even when they weren't on screen."

            "Nice app. Very useful. My one more suggestion is please add some sound (male/female/binaural) for Hold. Sure it will help more. Thank you so much developer team. Sure I will suggest to my friends😊🙏❤️",
            "the only good breathing app. excellent, easy to use, intuitive. very powerful.",
            "Works very well for HRV biofeedback paced breathing. Simple and easy and the visual and sound cues are crisp and make it easy to know exactly when to start and stop each inhale, exhale and pause. The only issue is the blue color which can interfere with sleep. A warmer color scheme would also be easier on the eyes at night.",
            "The app is Nice but no update in 5 years??!!!!! And why can't I download some breathing profiles/schemes? For example some pranayama or some holotropic breathing. Maybe some other sound available? What if I want to rename a breathing profile for save it when I change smartphone? Nothing! I mean it's still a valid app but no one behind it. No updates no improvements. I'll change my review as soon as the developer want to show up./ I purchased the app like 4 years ago, I paid for pro version and I didn't see any improvement. Unfortunately.",
            "Great app. One of the best I've tried. I rely on the vibrate feature. (The voices and sounds are otherwise very distracting). The vibrate is not working on my pixel 2 xl anymore. Not sure if it was an update from you or something else but without the vibrate feature working I can't really use it anymore."

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

            "I think that this and other apps in the range really do provide an easy way to have a regular pre-determined work out set out for you to do. It removes the anxiety and stress of having to do it yourself. Videos and explanations of the exercises would be a great addition.",
            "love this app, really easy and straightforward, adjusts to your level and plenty of excercises",
            "Great exercises. I started using this suite of apps just a couple weeks ago, so I have yet to SEE results. I do, however, FEEL the results! I really appreciate the difficulty rating at the end of a session. Instead of guessing what level I should be attempting, I try a routine, rate it at the end, and enjoy a more tailored session next time. That is great! I would give it 5 stars, but the app does not connect to Fit regularly. Usually, only the first session in a day is recorded."

Please try and fix this as soon as possible. Else this is the best chat app I have ever used. Oh and I recognised a new fault in it, When using the app or web app. It takes time to load on older computers and pcs which takes hours to load due the security.",

In mobile app to the caching of app state is buggy, and hide content on app switch dosent work, all it does is just shows the older app state. there are many more bugs but for the time being it that's the most I want to write. And add a feature to unfriend.",

Not sure what happened, been using it for a while and it used to be fine. Super frustrating when you're trying to carry on a conversation.",

Otherwise the app is fine, but I do feel it lacks some of the features that you get from keybase and that app was free. Unfortunately the PRC owns KB now so I can't trust it."

            "I really was liking this app, it makes things so much easier but then when I updated it and was trying to make something. After about 4 hours of editing the app suddenly stopped, crashed my phone and then deleted the prodject that has taken me a long time to make. That I was almost done with... I think there's major updates needed for this app so it can be stable on mobile phones.",
            "Easy UI to edit. Simple on the go. Love it. However. Can't export anything. I've tried re encoding original files to various file types and retried exporting with no success. Using Samsung Note 10+. I've taken a screen recording to send thru the app. Unfortunately when I try attaching the file it also gives me an error that the file type is unsupported and it's only 20 MB file. A few things broken. Hopefully it gets updated and fixed. Would love use it.",
            "After the Adobe MAX 2020, I am so excited to make my first video clip. However after I rendered it and try to play the video, it glitches all the way (like the camera is blinking eye instantly). Not sure is it because I'm using Android phone.. I see all the speakers who doing the demo, everything is so smooth... Hope this app could fix all the glitch and lagging and app crash issues in coming updates..",
            "The app has always been great. But all those easy-to-use options are only useful if the app works properly without crashing and without constantly restarting my phone. Unfortunately, that's not the case. I seriously am disappointed because this used to be my go-to app for editing.",
            "The program became worse overtime since the initial download. My videos take multiple attempts to export, export time is super slow for a short 2-3 min video. I like the app because it's nice to edit quick videos on my phone but what's the point of i record something and almost take an hour to be able to upload."

            "Love the app, however it would be better if you could read a whole book without having to wait on new chapters everyday, I love the werewolf stories, but another thing, if all the books in a series were placed together in order it would be much better, some I've read were out of order I believe, please think about putting them in order, also what's with the coins? It doesn't show how to use them in the app, mine are kinda just there",
            "This is, in my opinion, the best of the free reading story apps. The writers tend to have less spelling and grammar errors compared to other apps. So far, there have only been 2 stories that I chose not to finish. My only complaint is if you want to reread a story you have to scroll all the way to the beginning. It doesn't automatically put you there once you finish.",
            "Good stories but there are reading limits for the day. 5-7 \"chapters\" In and it won't let you continue until the next day. Really. Really. Annoying. There's an ad free option where you watch one long ad and get 15 minutes ad free. Which is helpful since otherwise the ads pop up every couple minutes. All in all, lovely app but could use some changes to make it more reader friendly.",
            "The books are good, but WAY too many ads. If you read fast, it feels like you spend more time watching ads than you do actually reading. Also, the limits on chapters per day is ridiculous. ESPECIALLY in a time where people are stuck inside due to Covid. I love to read, and i don't know anyone that does, who would want to be limited to a few chapters a day. Unlimited? No..thats just not true",
            "This app is great if you want to read free romance novels of any kind. There are a lot of ads though and if you can't stand grammar or spelling mistakes, I would not suggest this app. Overall a great app but the ads are kinda rediculous. This isn't approximate but it seems like there are ads every 15 minutes. Some stories also only let you read 1 chapter a day but this is not the case for all the stories"

I tried to edit my son's interests, but every option just quickly flashes a selection and never selects anything. Was absolutely perfect until this recent update. Now my son will wonder why Santa won't call anymore. A bit awful, not even considering the $ we paid for the app. (Galaxy Note 8: Will re-review if fixed soon)",
            "This app sucks. Went to get this for my 5 year old daughter, and literally got 5 ads within the first minute. I havent even done anything yet. Also, I could not text in the app, couldnt add information... could not do anythingggg... be better off paying one of the homeless from the corner by a walmart to act like santa claus, than this useless app.",
            "This was a great app, but I’ve paid to renew my premium membership, and it shows up here, but the app is saying I need to pay again. I've emailed but I've only received an auto reply.",
            "This app is so good I like and love it so don't waste ur Mobile Data or ur Home Wifi just download this app but when am trying to tap the app it just says you need to fix ur Google Play Store so I am giving 4 stars so Toodle Toodles 😘😘😘😘😘😄",
            "Used to be good. I have used this app for the last couple of years but for some reason now it will not let me edit my childs likes or interests."

I cant seem to mute it permanently if i want to, and the name of the dj (whoever they are) are reflected on the bottom screen of the app. That was very unpleasant to see and always annoying. Please fix the app asap i like using it. Thanks",

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

            "Fieldwork is the best, and for me, the only way to organize and keep your jobsite and office working together in a cohesive and productive manner. There is far to many wonderful features to list in this review. Download the app and try it out for yourself and you will see. I will touch on what I feel is the most valuable feature of Fieldwire.... DOCUMENTATION. No more of the bickering of \"he didn't tell me\", \"yes I did\" etc..... ad nauseum. If its not in Fieldwire then you didnt say it. Love it",
            "I use this app for a large scale building project and it has been very useful in keeping track of everything from diagrams to punch lists and completed tasks. I love that it is very easy to look at with simplified tabs and folders that you can filter through. It is not crowded with too much text for the 1000+ items which makes reading much more efficient. One thing I'm not a fan of is having to download all the files prior to viewing anything on the app because my device space is limited.",
            "Great to for the whole team to use. Everyone can stay on the same page. I've only scratched the surface of this app.",
            "I recently started using Fieldwire to manage our installation projects and see some great benefit with not only managing the overall project but the ability to have all the final paperwork, including signed documents, pictures, etc.. in one location where we can then easily close out the project. Using Fieldwire also gives us the ability to provide the customer a professional detailed recap, including pictures, of all the work we completed during the installation. Highly recommended.",
            "A great program! Very helpful. I do wish the measuring tool was easier to use without trying to calibrate it. It should be able to select what scales the drawings are and calibrate itself. I have found myself off an inch or two while trying to calibrate it myself and suffered the consequences. In this business inches can make or break you. Overall though a really good program! Fat better than procore or others!"

Hound can use follow-up questions and commands to filter, sort, or add more information to the original request.

            "I've been a long term user of Torque Lite. The time has come to purchase the full version. Initially I've seen it as a tribute to author's dedication to create something so useful (I was fully content with even the limited usability of the lite version). After installing the Pro version I've realized it's a completely different app with absolutely amazing functionalities. Thumbs up for the author!",
            "EDIT: finally, belatedly, the issues with this app blocking its use on Android 11 are fixed. Aside from the long delay in fixing this, it is very useful albeit with some questionable UI decisions. On balance it gets five stars, just, because of the number of OBD features it supports out of the box, but some sort of UI update would be nice. Feature support is outstanding, much better than most.",
            "Always running in the background! Almost expect to see apps mining data in the background if they are free, but not when they cost. Does the same as many other free apps I've used, but slower. Really not impressed considering this app costs money, and was hoping to get away from the extra battery usage and invasion of privacy of free apps. Guess I should've just got a free one again.",
            "From great to nah in 2.9 seconds. Used to be a great, now it doesn't work. It won't connect to OBD2 scanner anymore. Tried it on different cars thinking that maybe my old scanner died and nothing. Got a new scanner and wouldn't connect to it either. I decided to try a different app and everything worked on the other app. What are you doing? This was a great app and you let it fall. Pick it up and make it great again. Note 10+",
            "For the most part I like it but even with the paid version there are tons of issues or bugs. Making dashboards would be cool if they would ever keep thier position after a few restarts. It likes to continue running in the background even after manually exiting it and after no more connection to the odb2 dongle.. and it doesn't always work the first or even second time opening it. Fails to connect or hangs. When it works right, it is pretty great."

            "I read tarot but don't always have the cards with me. The cards are accurate in their placement and as long as the person reading has their own context clues, the reading will be quite good. And the more I use this app, the more I appreciate all its features. Try out some of these different paths. I love the different spreads and will probably add some of then to what I do now. Even the ads are not intrusive. Very manageable. I am very grateful for this app.",
            "I love it. Fun, interesting & spot on with most of it. As it goes... \"Tarot never lies\". Its amazing how accurate these are. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose. Hope it works as well for others as it does me & people around me who try it from my phone. Mind blowing! Take what you read on the light side, not too serious. Its great.",
            "This app has so far been good. I don't have any problem using it every day 😅. Nevertheless, I would urge the creator to add one more special feature about moon & sun signs astrology😭, besides having the horoscope section. 😎😇 It will also better the app.",
            "That was actually spot on. I'm new to tarot but catching on quick. I have had paranormal experiences my entire life. Have seen 6 UFOs. Dreams I remember having, that give me deja vu, witch always have to do with future events in my life and are almost exactly the same. Plus I'm pretty good at predicting cards with shapes. Not sure what all that means and have been searching for answers my entire life. Tarot makes a lot of sense to me and so far it's been a positive tool in my life.",
            "First use was soooo accurate. I was able to connect with two friends spiritually and that's exactly what it read. Also, it said If I start a new business soon, I can accomplish it. Weirdd because I've been debating since last year and just these past few months about starting my own..."

I'm not going Premium. I will just delete n move on. Ironically the intruding add is called \"predator\". the latest updates were disappointing too. Sometimes less is more. I wish they had kept it simple. I will most certainly miss this part of my daily life.. Feeling sad to let have to let it go",
            "Overall a good app, but with some issues. I like to check the app everyday for my daily horoscopes. Its much faster than looking them up online. I enjoy the readings i get from the paid experience too. Recently though, i bought 2 other readings. They say that they can take up to an hour to process and post on the app, i understand that. My issue is that this was days ago and they have yet to post. Its been 2 weeks and no response. Requested refunds",
            "Bought the subscription and am unable to access premium services as offered. Also advertised that you will get natal birth chart with app and that is b.s. as yout have to subscribe which is the purpose of download. Super disappointed and wonder if this is really an app to rip off consumers which appears to be the case with a lot of the reviews I have read.",

            "Great app and product! I especially like the widget. It's 100% customizable, as many buttons as your screen can hold, and for each button you can choose the rooms, individual lighs, and a scene for each of them. I also LOVE that it's compatible with Google Home. All I have to say is \"Hey Google, I'll see you later\" and all the lights turn off, or \"Hey Google, I'm back\" and the lights turn on! So cool! (You do have to set that part up on Google Home app.)",
            "I've been using and expanding my Phillips Hue setup for sometime now. It's been absolutely brilliant. Any issues I've had have always been tracked down to my WIFI/router or third party apps. The bridge (2nd generation), globes, switches and sensors have not faulted. The app is great and easy to use. Google/Nest Home intergation and use has been great also. The good thing is that I've set it up in such a way that if the net goes down, I can still use a normal switch to turn on the lights!",
            "I've had this system now for a few years and last night (October 25, 2020) it stopped working. It keeps saying that it can't find the bridge and to make sure that is on the same Wi-Fi. No problem with my Wi-Fi & live alone, no pets, pretty much it's router & bridge have been untouched. I'm not the only one having this issue. Until they give us a fix, this rating is going to stand.",
            "It won't let me get past the update step as many other people have stated the same recently. I'm unable to finish the setup making all my Philips smart stuff uncontrollable and not so smart anymore. Amazingly everything was working flawlessly on the Bluetooth app which I was using as a stop gap until getting the bridge, now I can't even go back to it. Frustrated is an understatement. I have a Hive setup that has never give me any drama. I should have just stuck with their system. FFS!!!",
            "It's pretty basic and works fine. There are some usability features with both the app and the lights that I wish were implemented. For instance, the Phillips Wiz app has ability to trigger certain modes of the bulb depending on how you flick the light switch on and off. However, the Philips hue does not allow you to do something such as double flick the light switch to turn it to night mode. Zones and rooms are helpful, but grouping lights is needed. Would love to see more innovation with this."

My favorite game is Minecraft, but the only problem I have is the loading screan. It takes so long. But this one. It's really fast. I even played it one time when I had only 15 to play before I go to sleep. And I played it for the whole 15 minutes. I definitely recommend it. It is amazing.",
            "I've never see n game like this before , everytime i get bored playing only 1 game , but in this there are mpre than 1000. The second game like this is roblox . In that also there are more than infinite. The only difference is , in roblox we can create our own game , but in this , there is no option like that , thats the mistake(i think) and i think the creator should develop the graphics . Controls are very different , but in every game there should be a difference and i like the controls. Tq.",
            "absolutely amazing, love this app. easy to favorite your games and save space in your phone, 100% reccomend it, if you forget to favorite one you like, there is a play history and you can favorite it there! many games in one, and some new games that were made for this!! my favorites are, flappy bird, and its raining blocks, there are many more good ones though!",
            "This game is a lot of fun!! when I'm waiting on someone or if I'm just bored it is a fun little app to pull out I also really like that we can download the games and save them over all I just say this app is great you should definitely give it a try ;)",
            "i like bored button. as a person who is usually seen to have people borrow your phone to play games, bored button has all the games in one instead of me having to install them all. im not a very big games person, but i like to have this app around in case im in a flight or stuck waiting long it has all the things i needed to play instead of downloading each seperately. it works quite alright, minor bugs and crashes so yeah good job!"

            "Great game. Loved it. However, after playing it a few months I've noticed issues. Gyroscope aiming drifts a lot, despite me calibrating my gyroscope constantly. The music cut out and stopped playing until I uninstalled/reinstalled it. The biggest issue is the gun. It varies it's firing rate constantly. Some games it's fast, others it slows right down to a trickle. Often it varies between the two. The last time I played the movement on the screen froze completely. I quit and tried again. Nothing",
            "Very cool ! Graphics are great ! This game could be improved however, to make it more user friendly and easier for a disabled person such as I missing a left arm! For a person missing their right arm also! Having only one hand, ( four fingers and one thumb) obviously, makes it pretty difficult to get Beyond a certain level!! So try to improve it in that area guys and gals!! Good game!! Keep up the good work!!",
            "It's fun, the geo track is nearly spot on, but as you progress in the game... Your gun remains the same, while the aircraft becomes faster, more of them and your gun over heats and becomes useless... (Unless you want to \"buy\" upgrades) as rank increases, so should the ability of the gun I'm using.",
            "Awesome game. I can play it for hours, but it only seems like a few minutes. But then I look up to see what time it is, and my day has passed me by. Whole day gone. Man, I wish I could've had this game to play when I was locked up doing time. Lol.",
            "The graphics are messed up! As soon as you get past level 2 or 3 the aiming bounces around sooo much it makes it impossible to hit anything And yes I have tried adjusting the settings to no exail, other wise I think it would be pretty cool."

            "It freezes when I try to work with All Systems body trunk, I can't even isolate muscle because of very big lag of a program. It seems that problem occured on android 11, it was running perfectly before android update on Pixel 3a XL. Now program are partly unusable.",

            "I've purchased all systems. So can you please tell me what is the due date of app subscription?? Thank you glad to be part of this beautiful family of Atlas. Thank you to all the developers and all the team!!! Love you a lot❤ best app forever!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
            "I'm using this on a Redmi 8A. The first few months this app worked very well, I even bought the subscription, but looks like I wasted my money. This app hangs every single time I try to open it. It gets stuck on 100% loading and I have to uninstall it and install it again. It often misbehaves and directs me to another window when I'm viewing something. I do not always have access to fast internet and I have to wait for a long time to download it just for a one time use. Very disappointing."

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "Was trying to read gold markings on small piece of jewelry. Tried several other programs and could not get a clear enough pic of markings to make out what it said. This app worked beautifully! Easy to use, love the feature that freezes frame before it snaps pic. Thank you for making this so easy!!! Its now 2 months later and thanks to this app I am not getting screwed over on some jewelry I was considering buying. Also taking pictures is even easier. Love this app!",
            "Very Useful App. Great for tiny print . Update: As of lately, been using to scan over motherboard PCB's and GPU mainboards for failed components when needed. Do my own rework with this app by placing phone on makeshift holder. Better than a magscope or lit tech glass. Does way more than your camera does for those that feel your cam can do the same. Definitely an amazing app.",
            "Ive been using this app for a year now and it just amazes me how well it works.. I am older(52) and my eyes don't work so well anymore even with my glasses on, so this app has helped me so much. It will surpass any magnifying glass...any that ive ever tried...by a landslide.. great job guys and thank you.",
            "From others' recommendations I'd have loved to have used the app, & I'd actually downloaded it, but whilst I accept there's a need for the app's developers' to be rewarded through the addition of ads, I fail to understand why the app needs access to photographs & other files on my phone! As I can't understand the need to access my photos, contacts etc, I cannot support what isn't required for the app to work, so have uninstalled it."

I installed the app .For a new Phone and Job that will pair in daily life starting fresh. 1st of all I woke to singing female voices a rhythm to wake to, I liked that. So much so, the app Stays intalled, my mind made up I caught myself humming to the wake up tunes later that morning. Today weeks later I open the app again finding that I Would Have been even More Amazed with Features. 5, Stars Clearly.",
            "I love being able to wake up to light instead of an annoying sound. One thing I would like support for is the camera LED. It would be awesome if you could use that and have it get progressively brighter so I could keep my screen down during the night.",
            "Better than the others ... And I tried them I tried this app a couple years ago, and then tried a couple others. Of the ones I tried, this one worked the best for me and was the least annoying, over all. It lights up slowly and steadily, and allows me to wake up at my own speed,, but still gets me up when I need to be up, weather it's 5 am or 6:30 am.",
            "Love it! My hearing isn't what it used to be (I'm in my mid 20s I just listened to loud music and clicked my ears too much). I am just now coming to terms with it and apps like this really help! Regular alarms don't help--I sleep right through them. But I love this! It feels more natural with light anyway :)",
            "Great app for gentle wakeup. I paired this with another alarm app that makes me get up and walk to turn it off, and using both has completely changed my morning routine. No more snoozing to the point I have to rush to get ready and end up late. The gradual light wakes me up slowly, so I'm ready to get out of bed when my second alarm goes off."

I've given you an actual proof for why your app is dysfunction and inaccurate. Still no response. As a reminder, 1/1 @ 400bpm != 8/8 @ 400bpm. This decision saved your developers a lot of memory, but it made the app dysfunctional. 👎",
            "The app is great and recent firmware works great with the watch. But unless I turn on GPS it won't send notifications. Clearly not a connection issue since the metronome works perfectly with GPS turned off...

Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

Please fix, other then that cool app.",

People dont play games like this for long when forced ads and actually ads that give benefits exist all at the same time, you could've had much more ad viewability if you just kept the ads that give benifits when clicked on... you should know this by now.",

            "I am getting extremely irritated by this service, I have never had an issue till recently in the last 2 months, I am sick and tired of not recieving alerts which I need for the 3 departments I run with. I dont get alerts at all unless I open up the app, I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times over which doesn't seem to work. I called the help # and receive little help. Now today we get a cardiac arrest call and I didn't even receive an alert. I have a Samsung S8 is that the problem 😡😡😡",
            "2 days ago this app worked wonderfully. Received alerts, had several different emergency tones to chose from, especially since I'm on 3 depts and need all 3 to be different. Yesterday afternoon, however, it all stopped working entirely. Stopped receiving alerts, which I troubleshot myself and corrected, but ALL, every single emergency alert tone have vanished. I see it's been an issue for Samsung users but my device is a Google Pixel. The app is the latest version. What is this remedy for this?",
            "Good application, in my personal opinion, it should be better is the map gets more accurate. Sometimes we as EMT'S or medics get lost when gps doesn't take us where we are supposed to go",
            "I am getting late notifications, and the ringtone that I selected is not working. I selected a specific tone and it's not working. This has gotten worse in the last several weeks.",
            "Really great apps for first responders to be able to use for incoming incidents. Mapping it is also a huge plus when using Google maps!"

So if the basics are this difficult or unexpectedly different in appearances to my location, then its basically useless. ALSO a ton of ads, one with nearly every other move i make! Ugh.",

Other apps have that feature and are less expensive than this one. Too bad, because the rest of it seems pretty good.",
            "This is a very very tricky app to learn to use If you don't know how to use it properly it can be extraordinary frustrating. It has tons of features but if you check a box or adjust a setting of which there are very many it will be very frustrating to find objects and then to figure out what setting to go back and reset. You really need to study this and it features and take notes as you make changes to settings so you can go back and unravel any number of frustrating changes",

            "Amazing port of the original game. The controls are VERY smooth and easy to understand. The Combat is so satisfying and intuitive. The soundtrack is also very amazing, each track is unique and memorable. The story is absolutely phenomenal. Plays smoothly even on a smart phone, which still blows my mind. Definitely worth every penny you pay for this game, and worth the storage space. 10/10 would recommend.",
            "I want to start by saying Chrono Trigger is my favorite video game of all time. This port has all the great story, characters, gameplay and music of the original. If you are a fan, or have heard the myths about how good this game is, it is still worth every penny and is a must-have. However, the controls, even after updating, are still lackluster and a pain, and the graphics are tarnished by unnecessary filtering. It needs one more updates to add an ability to turn off filters.",
            "This is an update to my review, which was originally one star. In May 2020, I was unable to properly save to or restore from the cloud. While I believe this version could still use some TLC, an update was pushed out specifically to tackle this problem and other issues after my reports to Square Enix support. They worked with me, back and forth, for months to fix the issue. In appreciation to their efforts, I'm bumping this from 1 to 4 stars.",
            "This game is absolutely amazing. Hands down the best RPG of all time, so very wholesome. I don't know what is up with the bad reviews of this android version but I just beat it a few minutes ago and the gameplay was absolutely flawless, exactly how I remembered. I have a cheap android phone that's less than $100 and I encountered zero problems whatsoever. They even added a feature where you can save at pretty much any time, anywhere and it works exactly as expected. Such a beautiful game.",
            "The game looks pretty, the sound and music is wonderful, it however fails in combat occasionally the touch mechanic by which you select enemies in combat feels very imprecise. There are times in the game where it is very important that you attack certain parts of enemies to avoid harmful repurcussions and this results in deaths that otherwise could have been avoided. The game also includes a wonderful quicksave feature perfect for playing on the go during short bursts"
