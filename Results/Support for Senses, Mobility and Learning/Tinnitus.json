            "I have limited experience with it so far, but it does what is advertised and is amazing. I especially enjoy the ability to create custom sounds and set a timer. There are other apps that I will be trying out, but this is definitely a keeper and gets a full recommendation for anyone looking for background sounds while they are busy, trying to study or relax and for those trying to wind down for a nap or a good night's rest at the end of a long day.",
            "70 bucks a year for a sound generator / music app that keeps track of what you've played in when you've played it. 84 if you pay monthly. Total ripoff, there is no actual therapy here that you can't get out of any other music or sound player. No notch therapy, no static or white noise generator mixed in, or any other methods use. It looks to me like trying to take advantage of some people's desperation.",
            "It streams nicely through my hearing aids but haven't tried it very often nor had much success using it for Tinnitus yet. I do use it to help me get to sleep along with audio books through a pillow speaker. The books play for about 15 to 20 minutes and I set the Tinnitus app timer for 40 min. Very rarely does the Tinnitus app stop before I'm asleep.",
            "Tinnitus sucks, as my stress levels grow so to does the ringing. I was at breaking point last night lying in bed at 2am awake. Then I found this app. I played it at low levels and managed to go to sleep 20 minutes later. This is a game changer. I'll be investing in some sleeping headphones so i can maximise this app. It's also inspired me to look closer at my tinnitus and seek a management plan as well as look for ways to reduce my stress levels. Thank you so much to its creator.",
            "Ignore the 1 star reviews this app is excellent. If you're getting worked up over the noise in your head you can't control this app can generate sounds that give me relief. Just knowing I have something like this makes me feel better about my tinnitus, worst case I could always pop headphones on for a while and zone out."

But, it loses one star for the timer function not working-I have missed my work alarm a few times because of this, luckily my partner has been there to wake me. And it loses another star as it shuts down when your phone goes to sleep, so I have to change my phone's settings each night to never switch off and keep it on charge. I will keep the app, but I am on the look out for another unless Beltone can sort it out."

Using acoustic neuromodulation above 10000 Hz is an unknown area, but if you have such a high Tinnitus tone, you can try the therapy using Tonal Tinnitus Therapy.\r\n\r\nSome people really benefit from it, others don't notice any difference. Experiences can be found on the Internet. \r\n\r\nIf you suffer from hyperacusis, then be careful when using the app. Start with a few short periods of usage on a very low volume. When the therapy tones cause negative effects, don't continue using the app.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the therapy tones, you can add masking white noise, pink noise or brown noise to make it more pleasant. You can also use the masking noise without the therapy tones by lowering the therapy tones volume to zero.\r\n\r\nThe app is not free, but it offers a one week trial period. After that, you need to pay once for unlimited usage or you can start a subscription. \r\n\r\nUsage is simple: first find the frequency of your most dominant Tinnitus tone. The app plays the selected frequency and you can change the frequency until it matches your tone. Don't do this too quickly, it is absolutely necessary to find the right frequency. You can always check again if you have the right frequency selected.\r\n\r\nThe app configures four therapy tones, two below and two above your Tinnitus tone. Acoustic neuromodulation uses  these therapy tones in series of twelve with a short time interval to reset your Tinnitus tone. Before you start playing these series of therapy tones, you must check if you hear every therapy tone at the same volume. You can adapt the volume of every therapy tone if needed. Then you can start playing the therapy tones. While playing you can change the volume for left and right channel in the main screen. You can close the main screen and reopen it whenever you want. Playing the therapy tones happens in the background, you see the app icon in the notification bar while it is running.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to listen every day for at least four hours to the therapy tones. The app shows every day how much time you already listened. Some people notice positive effects after one day, others after several weeks or months and others never.\r\n\r\nWhen you use a headset and you unplug the headset, the app will pause playing. When you connect the headset again, the app will continue playing.\r\n\r\nUsage of this app is at your own risk. Read on the Internet about Acoustic Neuromodulation before you start using the app. If the app has unpleasant effects, stop immediately using it.\r\n\r\nIf you have problems with the app or suggestions for improvement, please mail to info@appyhapps.nl",

            "Very good app, returns moments of forgotten silence. I would give it 4.7 stars, because the process of searching for the correct frequency was very long and painful and finally impossible for me. I used another app for this, the main idea was to do it in steps, every time to choose between 2 freqs until right one was localized. Another very expected feature is to make an additional common volume slider for both ears at the same time. Big like for birds and river, good feature for focusing.",
            "It hasn't cured my tinnitus, but the ability to save different frequencies and play them back has given me brief moments of relative silence, and the therapy tones seem to help as well. It can take a while to find a good tone match, so don't give up. I can't seem to delete saved tones though, so a have quite a few cluttered saved tones.",
            "Decent app. Wish the tonal therapy wasn't in an 5/4 time signature, but 🤷‍♂️",
            "Excellent app. for calming down subjective tinnitus. Most important is to find out your own tinnitus tone frequency for ignorance by the brain.",
            "App is well designed in order to set therapy up to a common algorithm. However, it cause me to get additional tinnitus nasty high tones. No relief but worsened tinnitus. I do not recommend even try this app, instead to seek professional medical help or simply leave your tinnitus as is. Do not let it get worse."

I love the variety of sounds on this app and the fact that you can set it for several hours. Some of the water sounds are very loud and not soothing. My favourites are the wind through the cornfield, and the sea tide at the beach. Highly recommend this app if you want a good night's sleep. Each choices has 4 options that you can vary the sound levels of.",

It features a variety of noise options (from pure droning white noise to simulating rain forests or busy cafes). You can set a timer, run it in the background and the adverts are non-intrusive.

            "I like the user interface. It's attractive and easy to use and has all the options I think you'd need without being too complicated or messy. And if the concept of the app helps you, I think it's definitely worth the five bucks to get rid of the ads. However, that said, I'm not yet convinced that listening to \"notched\" tunes is any different (for me) than listening to un-notched tunes or that listening to white noise or forest sounds is any better than listening to the ringing in my head. It's basically just trading one sound for another so it's really just a matter of what you prefer to listen to. Truth be told, I can still hear my tinnitus amidst any other sound I am playing. Is the app helpful? I think anything that re-directs focus is helpful. If I'm engaged in deep enough thought, I can tune out and forget my tinnitus. I tried a few different apps here on Google Play and I have to say that this one is my favorite. I would like to have a Windows version as well.",
            "Great app but there are issues with the streaming radio feature. It always says \"server down, using built-in list\" but many of the stations are no longer working. An updated server list should fix this. Also searching in the server list does nothing, no matter what you search for, it always shows all the stations.",
            "Love! I've been using this app for 6 months now. 90 minutes daily. It has lowered my tinnitus loudness. I noticed a bit of improvement in the first week and the app help with a slow and steady improvement over time. Really a super cool app! Thank you!!",
            "Very wide range of web radio stations from which to choose, plus plays tracks from your own device plus white noise, rain sea sounds etc. Good value. Yet to find if notched audio therapy works.",
            "Love this app ! Use every day streaming through my hearing aids. Took a while to find my T frequency and it will take a long time to know if I get a reduction in T. In the meantime, I get to listen to music daily and know it's an attempt at audio therapy. The app tracks listening stats and shows real time playback stats for freq and db. Even stream web radio !

Awesome app!",

This produces white, pink or white noise which is regular and constant. I use it every night for 7 hours.  My tinnitus gets louder in quiet situations, so this both keeps it down, but also I can listen to this soothing sound rather than my tinnitus. Sounds illogical but it works for me.

When you select a category you'll pop pver to a new empty screen with a + icon at the top right. When you push the + icon you can \"select from app library\" or \"select from your music library\". When you choose \"select from app library\" you'll get a list of 10 sounds to choose from. 4/5 stars for not being more obvious for consumers.",
            "App works very well with my new Phonak hearing aids. Helps me deal with my 24/7 tinnitus, suffered from combat. Regarding sounds included I found them in the App, so not sure why others are complaining. Tip: When you open the App it says under the Sound Type tab that there's zero present. But press the arrow on the right side, that will  cause a pop-up message that says \"get started by adding a sound\", press that and a \"select from library\" option will appear. Press that, the \"default sounds\" included with the app will appear. (E.g., Blackbirds, campfire, chimes, harbor, ocean.\")  Tip to Phonak: you need to make this App easier to use. Sounds included should appear on a menu when one first opens the App.   I \"hear\" a 4800 mHz tone. This sound machine app, so to speak, sends supplied or selected sounds, aka white noise, to lessen or eliminate the tone I hear. Oh, I get my hearing aids from the VA. This time, June 3019, I got Phonak Audeo M90-R RIC.",

            "I use this app to fall asleep literally EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. Easy to use, the sounds are great, the UI is intuitive. On top of all that, I recently ran into an issue with it and emailed the developer -- they got back to me right away and had a fix ready in just a few hours! Great app; give it a try and you won't be disappointed! Now, back to sleep...",
            "Nice app with a lot of excellent quality sounds. The price is reasonable and not subscription based--unlike many other, similar applications. I had a problem with a full page ad that popped up and did not have the usual X to close it--at least I didn't see it where it usually is. Since that really wasn't the developer's fault and he responded promptly to what happened, I decided to give the app another try and I ended up purchasing it. One thing I would like to see added is to have an option on some of the sounds to adjust how often they play. For example, it would be nice to hear the train sound but less frequently. Very few apps allow this unfortunately.",
            "Before I started using this app I used a loud fan to focus on, this is so much more relaxing and soothing, I just love it, I'm so happy I decided to buy this app. I'm happy but calm lol you'll love it@",
            "I downloaded the free version of this app years ago along with a bunch of others to try and find the best realistic rain sound. This one is bar far the best and most versatile, and I have since upgraded to the premium version which is even better. You can layer up to 10 different sounds and create such atmospheric and relaxing combinations. The premium version also transferred automatically to my new phone which is a bonus. I link it to my echo dot at night to help me sleep.",

        "description": "Tinnitus is defined as an auditory perception in the absence of any physical source. Almost everyone will experience some form of tinnitus at least once in the lifetime and in most of the cases this sensation disappears within seconds or minutes. However, in approximately 10% of the population the tinnitus persists for more than six months and can remain chronic for the rest of the life.\r\n\r\nEven in the chronic case, the perception of the tinnitus can vary during the day and between days being sometimes more and sometimes less perceivable. The variation can depend on many factors including environmental noise, the daily activity, stressful life events, time of the day and much more. Many people have a good feeling of their tinnitus variation and can reconstruct it from memory to some extent - but how was the timeline of the variation exactly? Until recently it was not possible to systematically track the tinnitus perception over several weeks.\r\n\r\nWith this research project we want to offer a method to track the individual tinnitus perception with a smart phone application. Using the website in conjunction with your phone you can systematically track the variation of your tinnitus and find out how it is associated with your daily routine and activities.

        "description": "Though many may suffer with the symptoms, there are also many who do not know the medical term or wonder just what is tinnitus? In simple terms, this refers to the noise that can be heard inside the ear or head of the affected person. The sound is described as ringing, wheezing, buzzing, and other mostly high-pitched, shrill and repetitive notes. For some, the noise is heard periodically; for others, it is heard constantly without pause or cessation.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no actual loss of hearing in tinnitus, the repetitive and constant sounds distracts the person from clearly perceiving or interpreting the sounds from his/her surroundings. For people with worst cases, tinnitus provides them virtually no quiet moment during all waking hours, and even cause them difficulty in getting a decent good night's sleep.\r\n\r\nTinnitus can greatly affect the quality of life of the person suffering from it. Normal activities, even something as simple as walking on the street, can be severely limited and risky due to the difficulty in focusing and cognitive ability brought about by the distracting noises. On a day-to-day basis, tinnitus causes headaches, dizziness, lack of sleep, and plain hopelessness at having to endure such conditions that are seemingly without cure.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the social, professional and personal relationships of a person with tinnitus is also limited, since interacting with other people requires clearly understanding and correctly interpreting nuances in verbal and interpersonal communications. Career choices can be extremely narrowed down, as important professional skills, such as ability to focus and to follow instructions, can be hindered by the auditory distractions caused by tinnitus. Working in the fields of construction and infrastructure, machinery operations, and occupations with hazardous environments are also often crossed out from workplace possibilities.\r\n\r\nHolistic methods of approaching tinnitus is said to help people manage daily activities, boost their health, and improve their quality of life. Meditation, acupuncture, yoga, biofeedback training and hypnosis can greatly induce relaxation, thereby relieving the stress and tensions brought about by tinnitus, and eventually make the noises subside.

            "This is a really nicely made app, and very effective for treating tinnitus. The whole concept of 'tailoring' the stimulus to maximise its effect works incredibly well, and I found that it took a very short amount of time to find sounds that pretty much reduced my tinnitus to zero. It's also really nice that you can choose between white noise, and more natural sounds such as running water - I found the natural sounds to be extremely effective, and also more pleasant to listen to.   I haven't experimented yet with long-term effects, but it's already an app that  I'd highly recommend trying :)",

        "description": "Are you producing? Want to sound test your speakers or tune your instruments? Or simply, do you want to generate sounds and listen to the generated sounds in different frequencies? Well, then you need a frequency sound generator and sound analyzer to produce sound waves in different frequencies. Introducing Frequency Sound Generator! \r\nFrequency Generator Sound player lets you generate a sine, square, sawtooth or triangle sound wave with a frequency between 1Hz and 22000Hz (hertz). It produces accurate tone & soundwaves while being simple and easy to use. \r\nNo matter if you need to sound test and generate high frequency sounds or low frequency sounds, our frequency tone generator is your #1 best solution.\r\n\r\n▶️EASY CONTROL\r\nFrequency Sound Generator allows you to easily change the soundwaves from the main menu. Simply tap on the sound wave icon and pick between sine, square, sawtooth or triangle. Additionally, pick from a wide variety of notes by taping the notes 🎵 icon.\r\n\r\n📲ANIMATED SOUND WAVE\r\nYou’ll love the animated sound wave function which visually represents the sound for a given frequency. You can change waveform by clicking on a round button at the left side and get a different sound and animated wave. \r\n\r\n\r\n🎚️ADJUST FREQUENCY & VOLUME\r\nAdjust the sound generating frequency easily by dragging the yellow dot. Make use of the - & + buttons for added adjusting precision. Additionally, control the volume of the generated sounds from 0-100%.\r\n\r\n📑SAVE YOUR OWN PRESETS\r\nBy clicking on the three dots in the top right corner you can create and load your own favorite frequency sound presets so you do not have to dial it every time again.\r\n\r\n🎼PLAY FREQUENCY SOUNDS IN THE BACKGROUND\r\nIn the frequency generator app settings, you can choose if you want the frequency sound to continue playing in the background when you minimize the frequency sound playing app.\r\n\r\n🔊NUMEROUS USES:\r\nThis sound generating app can be used in multiple use cases:\r\n● Test your hearing. A human being is capable of hearing frequencies in the average range of 20Hz-20000Hz. This range is getting smaller by age, so it’s interesting to sound test your hearing capabilities.\r\n● Test speakers and headphones for the high end (treble) and low end (bass) tones.\r\n● Use this app as an instrument tuner when playing or producing.\r\n● Cleaning water from the speaker. Since sound is making small vibrations it can help to shake off unwanted water from your speakers.\r\n● Find your tinnitus frequency.\r\n\r\n\r\n⚙️ SETTINGS:\r\nThere are few settings you can adjust to customize Frequency Generator app behavior. \r\n● Change frequency slider range to allow you more precision while selecting frequencies.\r\n● Choose between two slider scales: linear or logarithmic.\r\n● Low latency setting enables high-performance low latency audio which makes slider more responsive and eliminates lag.  (NOTE: Low latency setting may result in high frequencies on some devices sound inaccurate, especially on higher volume.) \r\n● Enable or disable decimal precision up two decimals in case of need for more precise sound generation. \r\n● Change +/- button step for even easier adjustments.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: Since mobile phones are not high-quality audio sources and in-built speakers may vary in quality, sometimes users can hear sounds at very low or high frequencies even beyond the scope of human hearing. That noise is not sound of a given frequency but static or “parasite” noise generated by your mobile device. For the best experience use a pair of good quality headphones.",

            "This should be better named \"The Ad-Storm generator\". In 10 minutes of use after the first install I got at least 10 fullscreen ads, which take some time to download, so the phone became very slow and unresponsive. In fact, every time you press the Play/Stop button, you'll get an ad. Also, frequency adjustment is rather difficult. It turns out that the slider doesn't have a linear scale, so all the higher frequencies are crammed up at the right end. There are also other problems that I found.",
            "I love this app! I started it 5 days ago, at a set range of 38 to 44Hz, the frequency meant to bother, repel roaches, fleas, rat mites and flies. I haven't seen a single roach since the moment I turned it on, playing it 18 hours a day. This app & setting seems to kill the adult mites, confuse the fleas though they're still biting and has no effect upon the flies. I also used it at 727Hz for the flu and it really helped. I tried 2 other similar apps and they sucked! Well done Hz developers! 😊",
            "I had problems with the neighbor's dog barking, this dealt with the issue through a wireless speaker, I have had problems with people parking in front of my house playing their music with extreme bass, this dealt with the issue, it is great for rodents, two-legged or four. Connecting up to an external speaker source, install ear plugs, stand clear of speakers 👍👍 I recommend this app to anybody with these type of issues, earplugs are a must.",
            "I first download an free app that was suggested by a seller on U tube that app was not working at all, no frequency was coming out of it,after trying multiple times I had enough and look for something else, so finally download this app and the first time I tried everything working good and still the end,I'm really happy with this one I can work on my speakers without worry,plus it is really simple to use and I recommend this app to everybody that need to use frequency to fix,repair stuff",
            "Not bad so far its October 17.2020. Not sure if the lower waveforms are accurate like 1-5hz and 7-8hz. Will check back after my expensive military speaker comes, I already have a 14mic array specially designed and connected to Azure ML cloud running on a custom built program I have been developing for the past year. I will share the finished model on github in a couple weeks, or month , depending on my shipment arriving on time and not seized lol"

        "description": "Tinnitus 911 is an all-natural product that can help you in fighting tinnitus. Tinnitus is a condition that causes a consistent ringing in one’s ears along with throbbing headaches, nausea, and dizziness. By using Tinnitus 911, you can improve your lifestyle by quieting down the ringing in your ears and eliminating the symptoms that it brings along. Subsequently, the end result is a side-effect-free solution for tinnitus.\r\n\r\n​Tinnitus 911 by PhytAge Labs has a unique blend of synergistic ingredients that help quiet the parts of the brain that cause this overall issue.\r\n\r\n➟What Is Tinnitus 911™ ?\r\n\r\nThe new Tinnitus 911 is a hearing relief formula designed specifically for tinnitus sufferers looking to soothe the central nervous system and provide relief for the ringing or other phantom noises in the ears.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking to finally put an end to those irritating ear noises, then you’ve come to the right place! Tinnitus 911 is an all-natural solution that provides quick relief of ear ringing, buzzing, clicking and hissing.\r\n\r\n➟Tinnitus 911™ Ingredients?\r\n\r\n✔Vitamin C:\r\n✔Vitamin B6:\r\n​✔Vitamin B2:\r\n✔Folic acid:\r\n✔Vitamin B12:\r\n​✔Garlic essence:\r\n​✔Hibiscus flower extract:\r\n​✔Olive leaf extract:\r\n✔Hawthorn berry extract: \r\n​✔Buchu leaves extract:\r\n✔Uva Uris extract:\r\n✔Green Tea Extract:\r\n\r\n➟How Does It Works?\r\n\r\nTinnitus 911 works by providing your body with the vitamins, minerals, and other ingredients it needs to begin repairing damaged ears. In order for your damaged nerves, or other components of your hearing system, to begin recovering, they need to have the proper “building blocks.” Tinnitus 911 helps provide these building blocks and can help make the ringing eventually go away.\r\n\r\n​The supplement's effectiveness works in several stages to lighten tinnitus:\r\n\r\n✔Stage One: Clears the Ringing\r\nThe main stage is that after a couple of days of constant use of Tinnitus 911, customers will see a noticeable decrease in the amount of sound in their ears. Finally, the hearing will become clearer and clients can begin to feel better, lucid and happier as well.\r\n\r\n✔Stage Two: A Calm Personality\r\nThe second phase of the formula is to finally recover a calm personality. The increase in tranquillity is the consequence of the olive leaves in the product.\r\n\r\n✔Stage Three: Enhanced Memory\r\nThirdly, as the ringing dissipates, clients will have the ability to think even more accurately and will feel an improvement in memory and psychological ability. These effects are the result of a large amount of niacin, also called vitamin B3, in the body.\r\n\r\nIn addition to vitamin B3, the product is also rich in garlic. With these mixtures and others, customers will find a decrease in exhaustion, the feeling of being stunned and more mental clarity.\r\n\r\n✔Stage Four: A Recharged Brain\r\nFinally, individuals who use tinnitus 911, can also notice an improvement in their mind faculties.* That is because the ingredients in the formula energize and rejuvenate the mind by nourishing the cells so that customers can think faster and with greater vitality.\r\n\r\nThis four-stage process is sufficient to correct tinnitus. And with frequent use for at least 90 days you can get a clearer mind and the peace of mind you deserve!\r\n\r\n➟Tinnitus 911™ Benefits\r\n➟Bring Back Sweet Silence Into Your Life\r\n➟Regain Your Full Hearing\r\n➟Improved Brain Functions\r\n➟Increased Focus And Productivity\r\n➟Enhanced Brain Protection From Degeneration\r\n➟Decreased Stress And Anxiety",

            "Good test ....BUT just a warning. It will change the volume settings on your phone. For me it left them on MAX, so I got painfully blasted out by my earphones when i went on to listen to music after running a hearing test. Really not good!",
            "I really like idea .. but can it actually replace pure tone audiometry(although bone conduction not possible)..if yes then even paying a premium shouldn't be a problem Since we are using frequencies , what about monosyllables and checking speech reception threshold , speech discrimination score, sisi score, tone decay test. It doesn't need to be the exact thing ..just something that could be performed easily on opd hours as a screening",
            "There are no instructions! Do I hold down 'I Can Hear\" until the beeping stops or tap for each beep? Do I have to hit 'I Cannot Hear' once the beeping stops or can I just stop pressing 'I Can Hear'? When do I hit the Barely Audible button - when the sound is actually barely audible or is this just a badly named Confirm/Next button? Also I would prefer to use the Hide Results option but you cant pause. If I go into settings to select Hide Result, I miss beeps.",
            "Works good. But the results can be deviated to the better ear thresholds if the person has asymmetrical thresholds. For eg. left ear has severe and right has normal hearing , the app displays erroneous results in poorer ear. Any suggestion for presentation of noise to better ear to avoid its participation?",
            "This is wonderful, easy to read and use. it's results are closely accurate too. However I would suggest that naming of files should be enabled in the app to aid file differentiation. Thank you."

            "Update 10/9/20 Upgraded to Galaxy S10+ . Now the app only sees 1 of the aids. Troubleshooting is useless and Oticon does not have a Support number. Sad my hearing remains diminished! Won't pair with Bluetooth I use a Samsung Galaxy S5 mobile and a Samsung Chromebook Plus. This app just will not pair with Bluetooth no matter what I do. I remove and re-insert batteries, turn Bluetooth off and on again...nothing works. The user manual does not say much about this and only references Apple IOS.",
            "I very much like the funtionality but this app is terrible with its BT connection. Pairing to my LG (less than 2 yrs old) is extremly difficult and unreliable. I dont belive Oticon is properly supporting android users like it does with apple phones. Also the BT connection to the TV is not reliable. Also why cant you stream phone calls and music without the need for the connect clip, which is awkward to use??. Apple users do not need a connect clip.",
            "Hi, I've used this app for about 2 weeks now and would like to leave some tips and requests to its product team. My phone, Android, is a Samsung, less than 1 year old. 1. the app does not capture accurately the battery usage and loss. The % of use does not decrease daily. I get a replacement notice only when it is basically dead, when the device beeps. 2. the Hearing Fitness area also does not capture accurately the hours I use the device. For most days, it counts much less time than I used it (for instance, I use 10 hs and it counts 2hs.). It would be nice to see these two features working well. Thanks.",
            "The app is nice. Works fine on my Samsung Galaxy J5 Pro (2017). Connected by turning on Bluetooth, starting the app, followed the prompts (open and closing the battery compartment when told), and it all connected. What would be nice, now, would be to enable audio pass through so when playing audio (through music apps or audiobooks) or video (e.g. YouTube) that it came through on the hearing aid. I'm not sure why this is taking so long to achieve since audio passthrough on Bluetooth is something that has been a capability for a long time now. Plus, Android occupies are fair size of the market, and not everyone has iPhones (or can afford them). So, please, we are literally begging you, enable media support/audio pass through for hearing aids connected to android phones (note: no, getting a connect clip is not the answer, as this another device to carry that can quite easily be lost).",
            "21 October 2020. This issue has reappeared. Tried reinstall with no success. App appears to be broken in latest update on Galaxy S10. When I open the app I see a gray rectangle and nothing else. Sound control and listening environment settings in notification area still work. Pairing works too."

Edit: as dev confirms, for free (in exchange of your medical plus contact info), you'll know you have tinnitus. Great, right!? \"Hey, you can even listen to your tinnitus in our app, what more might you possibly want?\"",
            "So you ask for my information before i can even see what this app does. Then when I fill everything in and find the tinnitus profile i cannot use the even the basic sound for a limited time, to see if it helps some aspect, without immediately signing up. Thanks but no... +1 for the innovative slider.",

            "*edited* I used to really like this app but it has gotten buggy lately and now has obtrusive advertising. To change a sound it now pops up a loud obnoxious ad, not great right before bed when trying to relax. And the solution is to spend $50 to remove ads??? I can buy a sound machine for less than half that price 🙄 Nice app for drowning out noises. I like that you can combine different sounds and adjust the volume of each type of sound separately. Like you can have rain and add thunder",
            "Technically, the app is great. It works well, has brilliant sound environments, looks good and definitely creates a pleasant, productive atmosphere. I would love to buy it, I do so many times with good apps to show my support for its developers, but I'm not giving €55 for this, it's a ridiculously high price.",
            "As others have mentioned: BE CAREFUL! I almost accidentally tapped the $91 in-app purchase to remove ads. I have no idea why it costs that much, but there's a delay when you click the \"x\" on the advert and it's in the same position where the \"Pay\" button appears, so the lag made me tap again, just before the pay button appeared. This is partly a problem that Google Play should fix (add a few seconds where the Pay button is disabled), but it also seems very shady that they're charging that much to remove ads - I imagine there have been quite a few people who have accidentally bought it.",
            "Have generally enjoyed the app but it recently started crashing when I try to close it and won't respond to \"Close\" function or device based \"Close All\". I literally have to restart my phone to get it to turn off. Good times. Now it's telling me that they want $50 for an ad free version. Cmon guys, think you may be getting a little big for your britches there. Its a digital noise maker and its not like you're dishing out royalties. 😑",
            "I don't like it getting stuck on an ad for one minute when I first wake up, you should have the ad placement when I am turning it on not off and a pay option that isn't pure insanity. It likes to randomly shut off, I still haven't figured out why, I've had it on four phones and it's been a problem on all of them, but it's infrequent. Would also be really nice if it had a setting where other sounds could override it, such as voice-mail or a videocall."

I would, however, like the ability for the tone link app to be able to switch between zen+ programs, unless it's my hearing aids that are to blame. Other than that I'm happy.",
            "This app was great for over a year, but they decide to updated today (bug fixes). Now I can't open the app. So much for bug fixes. App has now been fixed and is now working. Thank you",
            "Up until last Tuesday worked a treat but now won't open, I have tried uninstalling and powering off my mobile then switching it back on, re installing app and it still wo't work Anyone have any suggestions or different app that does the same thing, not happy! Now Friday and very happy to say problem fixed thanks, happy again now 😁",
            "Most of the time the directionality function does not work. After a couple of months I complained, so the audiologist changed all the internal electronics and the receiver. There was no im0rovement.",

            "Since I've completed my fitting I can say, still, the app does its job flawlessly. I'm currently using skeleton molds as the hearing aids don't stay in my ears. I would, however, like the ability for the tone link app to be able to switch between zen+ programs, unless it's my hearing aids that are to blame. Other than that I'm happy.",
            "This app was great for over a year, but they decide to updated today (bug fixes). Now I can't open the app. So much for bug fixes. App has now been fixed and is now working. Thank you",
            "Up until last Tuesday worked a treat but now won't open, I have tried uninstalling and powering off my mobile then switching it back on, re installing app and it still wo't work Anyone have any suggestions or different app that does the same thing, not happy! Now Friday and very happy to say problem fixed thanks, happy again now 😁",
            "Most of the time the directionality function does not work. After a couple of months I complained, so the audiologist changed all the internal electronics and the receiver. There was no im0rovement.",

It is also recommended for relaxing, improving concentration or as a help to go to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE COLORS OF NOISE\r\nYou can choose among pink noise, white noise or brown noise. All of them are high quality sounds with a bandwitdh of 1-22,050 Hz.\r\n\r\nFINE VOLUME CONTROL \r\nEven the lowest volume of some devices can sound too loud for some hyperacusis sufferers. This app has a fine volume control that will let you adjust the volume to your needs, whatever they are. \r\n\r\nIt also lets you adjust the volume with high precision so that the volume gap between one step and the next one is not a problem anymore.\r\n\r\nBALANCE CONTROL\r\nYou can adjust the balance between the left and the the right channel.

        "comments": [
            "I have a bit to say on this app. I love the idea of being able to control and fine-tune my hearing aids, but the usage is far from an optimal experience. I have an older Android, Google Pixel, running Q which when I installed the app was the latest OS available. In general, the app seems to regularly have trouble connecting and staying connected to both hearing aids. Often, I'll open the app and it's connected to one but not the other (it's usually connected to the right, not the left). It doesn't search for the left and there's no way to force the search in the app. Sometimes it's a matter of closing and re-opening the app, sometimes it's a matter of force stop and restart before it connects again. Then there's the rare but not rare enough issue of the app \"forgetting\" my hearing aids all together. The app opens and tells me no hearing aids are connected. No amount of restarting makes them find my hearing aids and I need to pair them again. When I'm home this isn't a \"big deal\", but in general, I'm adjusting my hearing aids because of a change in my environment, and having to stop to deal with a screwy app means I'm paying attention to the wrong thing. I've created some favorites. I've experimented with using GPS - I have a job with a decent amount of ambient noise so I have a setting I use at work and set the GPS location to the office. I gave the app Location permission no matter whether I'm using the app or not. To date - about a month of use - it has NEVER automatically switched when I arrive at the office, and I've given it time. This isn't a third party app, and I wonder how much Widex cares - they don't update the app with any consistency. They should recognize that the users that use the app are tech savvy and want this level of control and want it to just work. I have fewer issues with my Fitbit, and that's syncing constantly. When the app works, it works fairly well, but that's less often than 50% of the time. I do wish there was more education in the app - I can switch to Pure or Universal, but a well written app would give me an indication of what these settings do. For example, \"Better for a crowded restaurant\" or \"Enhances Speech\". Anything would be better than switching blindly and trying to listen for the subtle nuanced differences. Come on, Widex, get it together. For what hearing Aids cost, the app should not be their Achilles Heel.",
            "Like many of the reviews have mentioned I am not having much success with retaining connectivity with the ear pieces. I have an android phone. The software looks impressive but I am not able to utilise the capabilities of the product because of connectivity issue. It is very dissapointing as these are top of the range aids. It is rather pointless having customised programs for different situations when it takes 10-15 minutes to get it functioning.",
            "Contrary to the negative reviews, I'm having zero issues. The in-app pairing was simple, the sound customization options are great (I'll be playing with that for a while!). Once the streaming feature update comes to Android, 5 stars!",
            "Won't connect to my Moto G4 phone which is Android 7.0. Sees my 330 Moment hearing aids but always fails to pair. Zen Tinnitus and Tonelink apps both pair and work. Pairs and works with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A tablet which is on Android 8.1.0 and I can create additional profiles to use other than the default Universal and Music, however no matter which new profile I have it on, the hearing aids also default back to Universal when I recharge them so is this hearing aids firmware or Moment app?",
            "When connected, works good. The issue is it takes 5 minutes or longer of un-pairing, re-paring, launching the app, closing the app. Very inconsistent and this will affect my decision on keeping or returning the Widex Moment aid. I have an Andriod btw... Update: Stopping and starting bluetooth helps but overall, this app is very unreliable. An update for Android is needed."

The 'Waterfall\" didn't sound as much like an actual waterfall as it did just white noise, but that could be just me. All in all, though, I think you have done an excellent job and I will definitely be using your app on a regular basis. Definitely 2 thumbs up from me."

            "I have tinnitus and I find that this app helps to calm it down and make it less volatile. I also did experience a 10 db improvement in 2 frequencies in my left ear, which is my worse ear. I got the improvement though by just focusing one frequency. I personally beleive the \"cardio\" helps to link still intact hair cells in the ear to synapse nerves that may have been damaged. Definately worth the 2 week trial. Use it everyday, at least one hour per day. You should see a good result!",
            "Great app for hearing loss. My son told me about it and after using it for about 4 weeks I'm noticing a HUGE DIFFERENCE! Admittedly I wasnt using it everyday, but even 4/5 days a weeks ended up helping my hearing. Def worth a shot and there's a free trial too. Hoping this keeps improving my hearing.",

        "recentChanges": "• Added audio balance and volume controls.<br>• Added a setting to control the behaviour of a long-press on the +/- buttons in Single oscillator and Multi-oscillators modes.<br>• You can now change the base tuning frequency for musical notes via the top-right menu (e.g. A₄ = 432Hz).<br>• Reworked the system controlling the amplitude of the signal: No longer follow an equal-loudness contour.<br>• Improved Android 10 support.<br>• More UI and technical improvements.",
        "comments": [
            "It's cool, I downloaded it as a bug deterrent, but the science on that is sketchy, but it's a really cool tool, binaurals, game sound effects and the phone generation and note tool I've used for choirs and tuning instruments, and testing headphones and speakers is brilliant fun. It's generally just great fun to mess about with and nice robust reliable buttons sliders and menus, makes me feel super sciency!",
            "Got this for messing around; but the fact that it allows you to play notes and also displays the frequency is pretty awesome. I went ahead and bought the app remove ads for 3 bux. The price is totally worth it considering all the audio tools they provide and all of the options you can play around with.",
            "Easy to select the number you need and it can play sound with the screen off! And it'll play until you turn it iff or you can set a timer easily. Also, you can have this playing in the background and be playing something else too. Thank you!",
            "This app is great you can pick different frequencies with different wavelengths I use this to set the mood when I want people to leave my house instead of really high picture sound up and everybody starts to get angry and they don't know why you should try it I haven't found a frequency that makes everybody happy",
            "This is not only fun, but a very useful and accessible app. If you like to experiment in scientific ways with electronics and audio, you need a frequency generator and this will give you a very good one at that. A very wide range of frequency is possible, limited only by the audio circuits and speaker in your device. Sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms are all possible, and can be tuned precisely to any musical note - making this app useful for musique concrete production techniques."

            "This app really let's down the experience of otherwise excellent hearing aids. As mentioned by others, with the Bluetooth connection to your phone activated, any interaction with the phone(taking a call,'liking a post on Facebook,plugging in the charger etc etc), causes a default to Autosense option,which kills the settings on your aids,or the custom settings you may have defined for yourself.(This is even after switching off ALL notifications from phone) This is a major fault,and needs fixing.",
            "Slowish to connect but a useful app once it has. Easy to use. Like others Ive found the app quite frequently disconnects which does limit it use. The disconnections are more frequent and are limiting the use of the app. I've installed the updated app and it makes no difference to the disconnections.",
            "Volume doesn't stays consistent when when using the app. Have the hearing aids turned down when a message comes in the volume changes to a painful level. Tried using some of the preset programs, can't edit or save. My Resound app worked much better.",
            "At least once a week, I have to uninstall/reinstall the app because one or the other of the HAs won't connect. It's an irritant because the app controls the sound and pitch. Since I have rechargeable HAs, the app is the ONLY way to control that aspect. I give the HAs a 5star but would rate the app a 3. When it works it's very, very good. But when it doesn't it's horrid.",
            "Close to useless. It keeps disconnecting the Bluetooth and resetting back to Automatic. More trouble than it is worth sadly. Moto Android 1"

        "description": "It is hard to live with tinnitus. Since you are the only one who hears the tinnitus sounds, you may feel alone. There are millions of tinnitus sufferers out there experiencing the same thing. This APP will provide you with strategies that can help you manage your tinnitus.\r\n\r\nTinnitus is the hearing of sound when no external sound is present. While often described as a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear to be coming from one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety or interferes with concentration.\r\n\r\nTinnitus is not a disease but a symptom that can result from a number of underlying causes. One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss. Other causes include: ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière's disease, brain tumors, emotional stress, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of tinnitus is usually based on the person's description. A number of questionnaires exist that assess how much tinnitus is interfering with a person's life. The diagnosis is commonly assisted with an audiogram and neurological exam. If certain problems are found, medical imaging, such as with MRI, may be performed. Other tests are suitable when tinnitus occurs with the same rhythm as the heartbeat. \r\n\r\nOccasionally, the sound may be heard by someone else using a stethoscope, in which case it is known as objective tinnitus.\r\n\r\nTinnitus can be perceived in one or both ears or in the head. Tinnitus is the description of a noise inside a person’s head in the absence of auditory stimulation. \r\n\r\nThe noise can be described in many different ways but the most common description of the tinnitus is a pure tone sound. It is usually described as a ringing noise but, in some patients, it takes the form of a high-pitched whining, electric buzzing, hissing, humming, tinging or whistling sound or as ticking, clicking, roaring, \"crickets\" or \"tree frogs\" or \"locusts (cicadas)\", tunes, songs, beeping, sizzling, sounds that slightly resemble human voices or even a pure steady tone like that heard during a hearing test and, in some cases, pressure changes from the interior ear. \r\n\r\nIt has also been described as a \"whooshing\" sound because of acute muscle spasms, as of wind or waves. Tinnitus can be intermittent or it can be continuous: in the latter case, it can be the cause of great distress. In some individuals, the intensity can be changed by shoulder, head, tongue, jaw or eye movements.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of tinnitus: subjective tinnitus and objective tinnitus. Tinnitus is usually subjective, meaning that others cannot hear it. Subjective tinnitus has been also called \"tinnitus aurium\" \"nonauditory\" and \"nonvibratory\" tinnitus. Occasionally, tinnitus may be heard by someone else using a stethoscope: in which case, it is objective tinnitus. Objective tinnitus has been called \"pseudo-tinnitus\" or \"vibratory\" tinnitus.\r\n\r\nDownload Tinnitus App It's FREE!! \r\n\r\nif you like our app rate and share with your friends and take a look in our other amazing apps!",

        "title": "Natural Remedies For Tinnitus",
        "description": "Tinnitus remedies can be many and varied. Hopefully this guide will help you to get a better understanding of which tinnitus remedies are right for you. Tinnitus can be triggered by conditions such as high blood pressure. In some cases it is linked to anxiety; in others, noise-induced hearing loss. Tinnitus is very common in people of all ages and so it is important to realise that you are not alone. Why some people get tinnitus It is important to remember that tinnitus is a symptom and not a disease. It is an interesting fact that men have problems with tinnitus more often than women. It is worth remembering that Tinnitus also can be worsened by caffeine and other stimulants, so patients should try eliminating use of these substances.\r\n\r\nTinnitus may be considered a significant symptom when its intensity so overrides normal environmental sounds that it invades the consciousness. The patient experiencing tinnitus may describe the sound as ringing, roaring, hissing, whistling, chirping, rustling, clicking or buzzing, or other descriptors. Tinnitus usually produces a shrill, high-pitched, unpleasant tone. In contrast, water and masking sounds are typically soothing. Tinnitus may disappear independently or it can disappear when an underlying problem is successfully treated. In cases of chronic tinnitus for which there is no treatable underlying problem, a variety of tinnitus remdies and suggestions may help to provide substantial relief for persons who suffer from the symptoms. For 1-2% of the general population, this condition causes a considerable amount of distress and interferes seriously with the ability to lead a normal life .It is very difficult to treat and represents, undoubtedly, one of the most difficult therapeutical problems for the otolaryngologist. Tinnitus had been present for at least 6 years in 50% of cases, and most (55%) reported a gradual onset. Tinnitus was described as mildly to extremely annoying by 67%.\r\n\r\nTinnitus may occur with hearing loss. Occasionally, it is a sign of high blood pressure, an allergy, or anemia . Tinnitus can be hard to detect due to the fact that the symptoms can come and go, affect one or both ears and be a high pitched ringing noise or a low dull roaring sound. This makes it harder to diagnose and can leave the sufferer feeling frustrated and helpless. Tinnitus is a common problem, affecting about 17% of the general population around the world (44 million people in the USA). It causes significant suffering in about 4% of the general population (10 million in the USA).\r\n\r\nTinnitus is often most noticeable when you are quiet and trying to get off to sleep. If you play a radio or stereo it can help to mask the tinnitus noise until you drop off to sleep. This disorder can occur in one or both ears, range in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and may be continuous or sporadic. Tinnitus is a symptom associated with many forms of hearing loss. It can also be a symptom of other health problems. Tinnitus is the perception of noise in the ear or head, which is generated inside the body rather than coming from outside. Tinnitus is usually only heard by the person with the condition, but in a very few rare cases it can also be heard by other people. Tinnitus can be managed with some lifestyle changes. Avoiding stress, fatigue and loud noise can help.",
        "descriptionHTML": "Tinnitus remedies can be many and varied. Hopefully this guide will help you to get a better understanding of which tinnitus remedies are right for you. Tinnitus can be triggered by conditions such as high blood pressure. In some cases it is linked to anxiety; in others, noise-induced hearing loss. Tinnitus is very common in people of all ages and so it is important to realise that you are not alone. Why some people get tinnitus It is important to remember that tinnitus is a symptom and not a disease. It is an interesting fact that men have problems with tinnitus more often than women. It is worth remembering that Tinnitus also can be worsened by caffeine and other stimulants, so patients should try eliminating use of these substances.<br><br>Tinnitus may be considered a significant symptom when its intensity so overrides normal environmental sounds that it invades the consciousness. The patient experiencing tinnitus may describe the sound as ringing, roaring, hissing, whistling, chirping, rustling, clicking or buzzing, or other descriptors. Tinnitus usually produces a shrill, high-pitched, unpleasant tone. In contrast, water and masking sounds are typically soothing. Tinnitus may disappear independently or it can disappear when an underlying problem is successfully treated. In cases of chronic tinnitus for which there is no treatable underlying problem, a variety of tinnitus remdies and suggestions may help to provide substantial relief for persons who suffer from the symptoms.

            "We are LOVING this app! There are so many different settings to choose from, that everyone would find their preferences! Super relaxing and it really helps us fall asleep faster. I played a rain sound on the roof with a little bit of thunder the other night, and my husband asked the next morning, if I heard it rained last night 😄. Thank you for this amazing app!!!🤩",
            "Perfection. I work remote a lot and have to sleep in strange places. Even after long and physically demanding days, I still have a difficult time falling asleep. I looked for this app after 40 minutes of tossing and turning through my allotted 4 hours to sleep. On my first try, I set a timer for 20 minutes and I don't think I last past the first five. I used this app for every night per week and it's still the sure fire away for me to get into deep, solid, restorative sleep. Get this app.",
            "Well I LOVED this app... For the first night. I went to use this the next evening, put my volume up, and there was no sound. I made sure it was playing and even put my volume up to full and nothing was happening, and it isn't my device, it must be the app, because it works fine in every other app or game I have. Idk y it did this, please could you tell me if there is a way to fix this??? Do recommend if it actually works for you.",
            "2nd night of perfect sleep, thanks to this app! The combinations of sounds was exactly what I needed! Also, I use this app in my earphones walking to and from work and it alleviates my anxiety issues! So far I can't recommend it enough!",
            "Waited to write this until I had tried premium for a week and gained access to premium across multiple devices, only paying once. The sounds are lovely, lots of options and the price is literally unbeatable. It's helped my son tremendously with calming down enough to sleep and is a fraction of the cost of the \"child oriented\" apps for sleep. (Moshi 🥴) The fact that I can have premium access on multiple devices is huge as I use it as well and also for my other child."

            "Amazing. Been 4 years now that I've used this every night to help me sleep. I can't imagine sleeping without the gentle sounds of rain and distant thunder",
            "Strange behavior on latest build - the app starts all by itself! Otherwise, smooth playing sounds with the ability to mix!",
            "Best noise app I've used. Great sound selection and quality. For me, the killer feature is the balance control, bc I have one ear that is much better than the other. I wish more apps had this. Also has good geeky controls over battery saver, multithreading, buffer, etc. Even if you are not a semi-deaf audio nerd like me, it's a great app overall. Well worth the cost of Pro to me. 😍",

        "description": "Natural Remedies for Tinnitus | Tinnitus is the term that describes a condition that makes it seem as if there is a sound originating in the ears even when there are no apparent external noises. Tinnitus is not actually a disease but is a symptom of some other underlying condition.\r\n\r\nMany health care professionals consider tinnitus to be a blessing in disguise. When tinnitus is present it can help detect an underlying disease or infection before it becomes aggravated. Once the cause is discovered the treatments are simple.\r\n\r\nThere are several different treatment options for tinnitus because of the various reasons for ringing in the ears. However, care should be used when treating tinnitus because some treatments can aggravate the conditions. For this reason, the best solutions are often home remedies for tinnitus that effectively control the ringing in the ears. Following you will find some of the common tinnitus home remedies\r\n\r\nOne of the very best tinnitus home remedies is your diet. Eat a fairly simple diet with few additional spices added to it. Work on reducing your consumption of saturated fats, salt, and sugar. Additionally, you should avoid drinking coffee and tea as this will worsen the pain.\r\n\r\nEat plenty of fresh fruits and green vegetables. This will reduce your suffering by improving your immune system. You can try chewing dry fruit to improve the blood circulation, which will go a long way toward curing tinnitus.\r\n\r\nWith daily exercise, you will stay mentally and physically fit. This will help reduce the risk of tinnitus occurring because it helps regulate your blood. Take only drugs that have been prescribed by your doctor as there are some drugs that tend to aggravate tinnitus.\r\n\r\nWhen you go to bed at night, turn a radio on but detune it and place it near you as you sleep to help neutralize the inner noise. This is a very effective home remedy for tinnitus.\r\n\r\nLoud noises are known to aggravate tinnitus so its best to avoid load noises such as traffic and those crowded public places. If these situations cannot be avoided, use ear plugs to control the decibel level of the noise that does enter your ears.\r\n\r\nThese are some very effective tinnitus home remedies that may help you quickly overcome the ringing noise in your ears without causing any unwanted side effects\r\n\r\nIn addition to these home remedies to treat tinnitus, there is another powerful technique that is being used today. This technique is used to control the ringing in the ears and is very effective. Any individual that suffers from tinnitus should apply this technique 40-50 times a day.\r\n\r\nThis technique is called ear drumming. To apply the method, both ears must be closed, using the palm of the hand with the fingers clasped behind the skull. Next, the index finger is placed over the middle finger. The index finger is then forced to slide over the middle finger, landing on the bottom of the skull, creating a drumming sound. This is a very effective tinnitus home remedy.",

There are some pretty awesome sounds on here that I have heard nowhere else !! Ex: Dishwasher, computer fan, sprinkler, helicopter blades spinning, washing machine, besides your normal sounds such as heavy rain, creek, wind, ocean, train, and oscillating fan (My Favorite) and others to pick from. The pics with each are so realistic!! TRY IT OUT!!",
            "I just opened this \"WHITE NOISE\" app and it's great- it's a combination of some of the others with more thrown in~ common every day sounds~ I always know when I open a MIKDROID app that I'm going to be happy with it because they are all set up so beautifully ~ I particularly like the train one as I've always found the sound of trains beckons to the past when life was simpler",
            "Have not been using this app very long, but it does everything I want, with no problems. It even plays in the background when I want to do other things on my tablet. It also has a timer so I can have it turn after I'm asleep. Try it, I think you'll like it. Happy sleeping!",
            "Fun to scroll through the sounds with your eyes closed and try to guess what each is. There are some really great relaxing sounds on here. I got stuck on oscillating fan and might be listening to that at night for some time.",
            "I like the app, especially the airplane sound, for sleeping. The only problem for me is that sometimes it just turns off by itself. Usually I have no problem, but recently it has been happening periodically."

            "I found a sound that I really like. However the app is glitchy. I set the timer for 10 hours so it will run all night, but it randomly stops throughout the night and has to be restarted. Also, if a text or email comes in, it automatically pauses the app and it has to be restarted then, too. It should quiet for notifications, but should come right back on. I almost paid for the premium service, but I am really glad I didn't. I'll be uninstalling as soon as I leave this review.",
            "I would rate this app much higher if it actually stayed on. Even if I set the timer, it shuts down in less than a minute. It's too bad. I love the soothing sounds.",
            "Great I love. It it's beautiful, pleasing to the eyes and the scenery is so beautiful, and restful to the eyes. Thanks.",

            "Honestly the sounds are great and is easy to use. I don't mind ads in free aps but the reality is that this is supposed to be an app to help you relax, sleep, meditate... But then video/graphic ads come on with incredibly annoying sounds or music. Defeats the entire purpose, and ruins an otherwise great app",
            "Had an ad come on while playing the brown noise, kinda ruined it as I use the noise for meditation. I closed the app and the sound continued. I had to restart my phone to get it to stop. Ads during the use of the sounds makes the whole thing pointless. It would ruin it for mindfulness or trying to sleep because of tinnitus etc.",
            "Best app out there, good for quiet mind and I would recommend to anyone there are no ads at all and if people do complain about ads it solution is actually very simple don't have it on at the same time as the Internet so I thank the developers who made this",
            "I like the brown noise the best. 2 stars because the app will randomly shut off for no reason, and then automatically revert to white noise. And you can't \"swipe\" over to go through the sounds, you have to pay for that now which is total bs. I have to uninstall and reinstall all the time because it will get bogged down with ads, or the looped sound gets really choppy.",
            "I downloaded this app in its free version because it had white, pink, and brown noise. I prefer the brown noise over the others for sleeping and this didn't disappoint. A very nice feature is exiting the application and the option for the app to keep running. There are shortcuts in the pulldown to stop the sound or close the app. The paid version removed all ads. Overall, a simple but highly useful and effective application."

            "Deeper sleep than with any other sounds. We've used a box fan in our room for years to help us sleep. I downloaded this app and used it on a vacation when we didn't have room to pack the huge box fan. Using a combination of white, brown, and other noises, including the Dreams frequency, we slept deeper than we could remember ever having slept before. Now we use this all the time and consistently wake up feeling nicely rested. The paid version is so worth it because of the dream frequency.",
            "I used to use this back when it was just a webpage, and it's helped so much with my anxiety and night terrors. This kind of app is deeply helpful for people like me. I love it, it's incredible, but I'm SO disappointed at the fact that premium is a SUBSCRIPTION and the outrageous price for it. If there was an option to purchase a certain package, like specific sounds, I'd have rated this the 5 stars it should have. I don't need new content every week. Unfortunately, it gets a 3.",
            "Wonderful! I used this a long while ago and decided to come back to it. I've been using the isochronic sounds for a while and they've actually helped! But i hear a LOT of static when i use them. I'm not sure if its an app problem or maybe phones arent meant to run such a low tone but its gotten a bit worse. Other than that the sounds are all perfect and just what i need with the free version.",
            "It's a lifesaver. You don't need cell service or wifi to use it, so no matter where you are you can have a waterfall, a campfire, and some peaceful music (or whatever noises you want) for free. It uses very little battery as well and will play in the background if you're using other apps. There are some noises you have to upgrade for, but for the most part, it's free, loud, and doesn't have audible looping. Thank goodness for this app.",
            "I really like the 'eternity' sound but every time I turn it on, there's this static noise that pops up. Its very distracting. I thought it might be my phone but I turned on the same music on YouTube and Spotify and there was no static, so it's definitely the app. I would like to continue using it on the app because it plays on and on but I don't want the static noise."

            "Disappointing experience with the app that doesn't live up to the web version. Glad it has my favorite sounds form the site to access, but the interface is unintuitive, esp for setting presets etc (should be a save icon or something to make it clearer). Animation isn't subtle in any of the presets - sliders go all the way down / up even in \"zen\" mode. App randomly pauses sometimes. Timer feature makes no sense, \"In/At\" ?? Would expect time out, and fade out speed maybe. Would love to see updates",
            "I paid the full sum to get all the sounds but for some reason the timer on the app doesn't work for me anymore. I had set it to 1 hour and 25 minutes but 7 hours later it was still running and the battery of my phone was drained. I'm also disappointed by the lack of updates on the sounds, it seemed so much nicer on the site.",
            "Been a big fan of mynoise online. I donate when I can because the different combinations of generators are perfect for studying, relaxing, just having some sound when you're cleaning or doing anything else. But I will echo other reviewers. The android app does feel neglected. While there's a lot of grear functionality, the sound quality's not the best. There's a lot of static, and sometimes it just stops for long enough for me to unlock my phone and then starts up again. Otherwise works fine",
            "Highly adjustable white noise generator with variations all free. However, there is a serious bug when used for sleeping or if you're away from the phone because it would simply stop or shut off for no apparent reason about 10% of the time. This means instead of waking up to my alarm, I wake up to the noise that this app was supposed to block out.

Sometimes one reacts with delay due to distraction or surprise effects, therefore a monitoring of the delays could give an indication whether its better to redo the test for a consistent result.",

            "The tests begin at an audible level, then ramp up quickly, making the result irrelevant. However, there's lots of analysis to put results in context. It's a very slick design, but the guy who ordered the screens should probably be doing something else for a while.",

If I get in my car with the Bluetooth stereo it will start coming through there even if i restarted my phone to shut it off earlier I will have to do it a second time Other than that I really like it",
            "Payed for the Timer, but really do not mind as I love the sounds; they have very much helped with sleep and when stressed. I know other music is free with a timer, but it's only two cups of coffee; and I recommend it.",

            "This app is truly a gem, probably my all time favorite. It's great for aiding sleep and meditation. Only problem is a couple of the effects that I love stopped working a few months ago (second of the singing bowls and windchimes). Hopefully they'll resolve this but besides that this is the elite of free apps.",
            "A tool to alleviate symptoms of depression. Listening to these sounds not only help me sleep, they help me focus throughout the day. Part meditative and part white noise, using the differnt sounds either individually or in combination is delightful. A fantastic app that has helped me through anxious moments and evened iut my energy to be more focused.",
            "So I finally pegged down the problem. If you quit the app whole a sound is playing, it will play endlessly until you force quit the app, which in turn messes up the sounds when you go back in. It all seems to stem from sounds not stopping after closing (not switching) the app.",
            "Love this App.... its free and perfect. Puts us right to sleep and so relaxing. The thunderstorm sounds actually helped my Dog with his fear of thunder and storms. He snores right through a real storm now as well as when I play the app before bed."

            "My hearing aid is pairing but only the system sounds can be played through my hearing aid while sounds from music and media come through my phone's speaker. Update: Unfortunately, just learned that my hearing aid (ENZO 3D) is compatible with iPhone only. However, I will be eligible for an upgrade in 2021 and by then, I'll be able to get a new pair of ReSound ENZO Q.",
            "When it works it is great but the Bluetooth connection is totally unreliable. Sometimes only the streaming function works and the hearing aids will not connect to your phone or only one of the two connects. I reloaded the app but after a few days of perfect operation the streaming function went away but the hearing aids connect each time.",
            "Resound ONE works great as I only have hearing loss in my left ear. However pairing with Android the Bluetooth settings do not give you an option to turn off the call and audio streaming like other bluetooth devices. I have to manually turn off bluetooth on every call and have to turn off bluetooth all together for watching anything even short videos to get sound out of the phone and not my single Resound ONE device. Please help!",
            "Finally have a phone (Google Pixel 4A) and Android version (11) allowing full use of this app with my Resound Preza (Costco) hearing aids. Phone ringing and call audio, video/music players, notification sounds..they all come to my HAs. Audio from Resound TV-2 streamer devices has lower priority, so that the audio stream fades if another sound source becomes active (e.g. notification chirp) and then resumes when the higher priority sound completes. And I don't have to use a phone clip.",
            "Enjoy the app and sound from TV Streamer 2 with my GN hearing aids. Recently however, my S9+ phone calls and media player only send audio to the right aid. About a month ago both aids worked with the phone. I get much better comprehension (25%) and enjoyment with both aids receiving sound. My wish is to have this android glitch corrected. Thank you for this nice product. Update: simple instructions from tech support fixed my android problems, many thanks Resound Tech Support Rocks!"

This app does NOT need precise GPS location nor be able to listen in on my phones microphone. EDIT: Notice the reply does not bother to say WHY they need to know where you are and WHY they need to record you. Liars.",
            "Update - 2 years later, and I still love this app for sleep, studying, and writing! Original post - I love the customization of this app and how easy it is to find new sounds to download. With so many to choose from and try out, there really is something for everyone. I'm not very tech savvy, but even I can create my own combinations of the downloads to get just what I need to help me focus. I rely on this app to help me tune out the rest of the world and concentrate on my projects, and I imagine it can be just as useful for people who wish to meditate, sleep, or just drown out surrounding noises with something more pleasant."

            "This app is amazing and it's free, the sounds are incredible plus u have a good selection of noises that u can mix together, yes their is a ad as soon as u turn it on but their isnt any ads while your listening for 8hrs just at the start, hey it's free they have to get paid also, so saying that, I will definitely be using this daily 💗💗💗💗",
            "Perfect for what I needed. Has the rain and water sounds, plus you can add in thunder, piano, violin, crickets, etc. You can set the timer if using to fall asleep. Only thing I don't like is it keeps playing when a phone call comes in. I have to tell the person to hang on while I try to shut it off so I can hear them. I try not to answer the phone as much as possible, so it's not a deal breaker or anything. Overall I love it.",
            "Great app, many rain sounds to choose from to fit any personality. App does not shut off at any time during the night while I run it and the ads are typically dark and the phone is able to go to sleep without the rain noises being shut off. Furthermore, the rain sounds are of exceptional quality.",
            "My favorite sleep app. Non stop rain sounds. Stays on too. I love all the different rain sounds. And additional sounds you can add. Perfect! I hate to sort through all the apps looking for these features. And with so many sound options. You have to find your sleep sweet spot. I'm so glad I did. I'm very happy!"

            "It's one of the best apps for hearing test on Android, I've been using it for a few years now. The developer finally released an update (thanks! it fixed that persistent crash on app closing, appreciate it!) My only gripe is with the calibration UI. The continuous tone calibration is basically useless, since it's hard to set the correct volume by up/down buttons as it keeps moving; it should've been done as a normal hearing test with subsequent value adjustments. Adjusting a test to another audiogram is much better, but the UI for it is very well hidden, and I'm not sure it works as advertised. I tried calibrating another device based on the previous I used, and the results are still widely different on the two devices. I also didn't find a way to store multiple custom adjustments (e.g. for different headphones); that would also be very useful.",
            "Using it in Demo mode, should really be called Uncalibrated mode. Using the same high quality Koss earphones and setup. Allows me to keep a progression chart and do tests after different exposure to loud sounds events. Suits my needs well.",
            "Having been tested several times by professionals (for tinnitus), I think this is a pretty good tool to check for potential issues, and see a professional.",
            "Absolutely fantastic app. this is the same like a professional hearing test.",
            "worked perfectly but just the print out issue and logo issues"

            "Very relaxing, is played everyday. I use this for my son to fall asleep and with the timer it's great. After 10/15 mins, he's normally fast asleep. Sometimes I play it for myself to go asleep too or just have some peace, time to do mindfulness. I love all the different options and sounds available, it's beautiful. 💜 The adds can be very annoying and if you hit the back button on your phone, it just stops the app. Other than that, I'm so glad I downloaded it.",
            "I sleep SOOOO much better if I listen to Nature Sounds. I set the timer for 2-4 hours. My favorite is the campfire with piano and wolf or chimes!!! I am also SOOOO happy I can play this app without being connected to the internet. Bonus!! 💖😻💖",
            "Lovely choices of soothing nature sounds to choose from.You can also add other nature sounds or music to make a layered effect. A timer is also available so that the app doesn't run longer than you want! EXCELLENT! 🤩",
            "It was very good app for relaxation nr it was the best ......bt now this time I'm facing a lot of issue with sound cracking......if I add another sound then it's not clear ......the sounds are so amazing bt due to this i am facing a lot of issue ...... Without this i just love this app....please fix this......... supporting team .........nr reply me first ..........",
            "Truly love this app. You can start off with just rain or fire or something else basic. Add in music or night/day creature sounds or all of it! So very versitile, and fits any and every mood so far!"

            "I've used this for a few weeks. I made a custom sound that reminds me of sleeping outside on our back lawn growing up... the flow of a large irrigation ditch and crickets. With the timer feature, it is almost perfect. If I could add an occasional frog, that would be perfect. The frog on the app is too repetitive. OCCASIONAL is missing. If the city, not the country is your thing, this app has that, too. Using free version.",
            "This app is very straightforward and easy to get started. The sounds are pleasant/relaxing and are accompaniedwith nice visuals. There are lots of options and it is fun to mix and customize different sounds. The visual design is gorgeous and beautiful with the use of cool nightly colors. (Gradients can be hard to pull off but you guys made everything so beautiful and easy to read bravo!!!) I am excited to use this more in my daily life to help me relax and get away from the rustle and bustle.",
            "In using this app for 5 minutes after installing it \"I was hooked!\" The amount of control you have over what weird variations that make us individuales are all found here. I was able to completely customize what, \"I need to sleep.\", here and be very specific in my wants and needs. I highly recomend it if you're used to falling asleep with the TV on like I do. I usually wake up as soon as the TV shuts off. I like the timer on this app as I somtimes need to have something running while I sleep.",
            "By far the best app for sleeping, you can customize everything to suit what helps you sleep. There are so many options to chose and you can individually turn volume up or down. I downloaded a few apps like this and i didnt even bother checking them out, i just uninstalled all of them and kept this one. Thanks for the great app, the rain is the only sound that helps me sleep and the added customized features help even more. Ive only used it for 2 minutes and i love it!",
            "Wonderful, especially being able to make custom sound mixes. Even my dogs and cats sleep better with the sounds playing! Some sounds in mixes seem to delay going on and sometimes don't go on at all. This may be sue to available bandwidth or something else (?) Like that it plays even while net surfing! Excellent, very useful, healthy app much needed in these stressful times. THANK YOU!"

For hearing aids that cost $7,000 a pair, it's dispicable that the quality of programming is so poor, considering my $30 Bluetooth earpiece connects every single time without fail. Shameful. New update- I worked with the manufacturer tech support for 30 minutes and they tried a bunch of things but couldn't fix it, I don't even think they understand how it works or what is wrong.",
            "I am 100% deaf in my right ear so purchasing a controllable hearing aid for my left ear was critical for quality of life with family & friends. I LOVE this digital hearing aid used with the Attune app. It is so comfortable, allows me to change settings for different scenarios, and so much more. The charger is a plus- batteries aren't needed and it cleans the hearing aid overnight. There is a learning curve with the app, but once understood, so easy to use. What a wonderful creation!!!",
            "Can not get app to pair with my Samsung Note 9 for phone or music. Will only pair with the ReSound link for tv. When is this expected to be working?",
            "I have an AGXR Q-series hearing aid. This app does most everything I need it to do - adjust volume, focus on speech, tinnitus management, etc. But as others have said it is lousy at pairing with my Android Pixel 3. The only reliable way I can get the hearing aid to connect to the phone is to restart my Pixel and then turn the hearing aid on. It is sort of a pain to have to do this every morning. For a 3K+ device you would think AGX could employ Android developers that could do a more professional job. Update : Seems to pay to write a bad review. A day or so after I wrote how bad pairing between my phone and my hearing aid was everything changed. Now it seems the app and my hearing aid are always connected. So I have upgraded my score from 2 to 3.",

Fall asleep faster and sleep better!\r\n\r\nIdeal for relaxing, sleeping, meditation, concentration, or if you have problems with tinnitus (ear ringing).\r\n\r\nThe app plays different sounds of the forest, the sounds played in this way are also known as white noise.\r\nWhite noise has beneficial effects on the body and mind because, covering the noise of the external environment, promotes relaxation and concentration.\r\n\r\nYou can set the timer and put your app in background or turn off the screen. At the end of the time, the sound fades gently and the application closes by itself. So you do not have to worry about closing the app if you fall asleep.\r\n\r\nDo you have trouble going to sleep?

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I often hear the sound skip, like it suddenly stops and starts, repeatedly every night at random intervals. I've also woken up in the night to realize it stopped working altogether. I've tried restarting the app, closing all apps and reopening it, and restarting my phone, but it still happens. It's extremely frustrating, and I don't think I can justify the purchase until it's fixed.",
            "To put it bluntly: this app rocks! Honestly! I've tried multiple apps such as this, but none of them had a feature where you could add music to ambient noises, not music of the type this app has. Due to personal reasons, I suffer from relentless insomnia, but this was literally my \"Ultimate Sleep solution\"! Every megabyte sacrificed for this app was worth it!",
            "I love this app. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have recently started having problems wit the app. It stops about 2 hours after I start it. I have purchased the premium package when I first got it, and it played all night. Now it doesn't. I love hearing music all night, it helps me sleep, so when it stops I wake up.",
            "Love this app and it's been a huge aid to sleep. I used to toss and turn for an hour or more, but now I almost always fall asleep well before the 45min timer turns off my favoured sound. There's a great variety of sounds too, lots more than other apps I've tried and much more realistic. I only use a few, and the one that works best for me is Gentle Rain so I tend to stick with that one. I paid for the full selection and was happy to (its just a small one-off fee) to get the variable timer.",
            "ABSOLUTLY 5+ STARS This is by far the best app I have ever used. The sounds are very authentic. You can download many sounds at the same time and save to your favorites. I enjoy so much, that I purchased the premium.Good deal.You won't regret it. I'm sleeping the best I ever have. Thanks to the Ultimate Sleep App. I have tried many others and none of them even come close.💯❤"

            "I've been using this app a lot lately. Great sounds, and the separate volume controls for rain and thunder make it even better. It has a wide selection of rain sounds, 21 as I write this. Some have additional sounds: \"Cozy Cabin\" has a crackling fireplace in the background, while \"City Rain\" has very subtle traffic and muted conversation in the background (these are awesome for studying). I highly recommend this apo!",
            "Fabulous. Great selection of variations. White noise optionally can be heard with screen turned off. And automatically pauses during phone calls. Excellent new features.",
            "Nice variety of sounds but every night it crashes, even after tinkering with battery /app settings. Not sure whether it's the app or the phone but either way, annoying.",
            "Have only had this app for a short time but so far I think its great. Lots of different rain sounds to choose from. I can't get past this new Train in the rain.",
            "Just the app that I needed. Free app with rain, rain and rain sounds. A LOT of variations, and playback options with ability to set custom intensity for the effects. Don't think I can even go a single day without using it to fall asleep, and in noisy environments like mine, it's a godsend"

With your headphones on you will be able to listen to where the sounds come from. If the sound is left or right of the head on the screen that is where you will hear it coming from. You will also be able to hear if the sound is in front or below you.\r\n•  If you would like you can disable the random orbits in the options and then they will continue in the direction they are currently going. You can swipe in the desired direction to change it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•   White noise and tapping noises can help drown out the outside world helping you fall to sleep faster. New pink noise and brown noises have been added also.\r\n\r\n•   Whispered positive affirmations will improve confidence and help stress relief and anxiety relief.\r\n\r\n•   Induce lucid dreaming with repeated whispered reality checks including, \"mind awake, body asleep\".\r\n\r\n•   Ambient sounds and relaxing music can create the perfect sleeping ambience.\r\n\r\n•  With the use of white noise and other relaxing sleep sounds, tinnitus can be relieved.\r\n\r\n•   Meditation music and relaxing melodies can help calm the nerves and is great as yoga music or for healing reiki.\r\n\r\n•   Relaxing with nature sounds is a form of noise sound therapy.\r\n\r\n•   Improving the quality of sleep is the number one increase to health.

            "So far so good. But is the fee $4.99 Forever (for real??)--& the ads stop?? Quite annoying if I'm asleep. Ugh! And why wont it play on both ear buds?? Hope it can work for me.... long time insomniac. I like the timer as well. Easy to operate...and can save sounds for different needs. Dig That!! 😊 Nice App so far! Trisha~",
            "The contents of the app are wonderful, but it crashes *constantly*. I have to restart it very often, once every five minutes or so. If not for that, this would've been a solid 5/5.",
            "I love the app it's really customizable and helps me calm down. Definitely give it a try if you're looking for something to help you slow down and/or fall asleep. My only criticism is a small one, I find it a bit annoying how slippery the sleep timer select menu is. It takes more effort and precision than you'd think necessary to set your timer at 20 minutes for example because it often will just glide right over to 30. Maybe that's just a problem on my phone. Anyways, this app is great!",
            "Exceeded My Expectations! Really impressive, very clear and understandable design. Even without paying, there are a lot of sounds to choose from and the detail you can put into your mixes is phenomenal! My favourite feature is that you can lock your phone and the sounds still play which allows me to save battery unlike on Yo*Tube haha. I hope that in the future you include a feature that allows the user to upload audio files they already have on their device and use them like the other sounds."

This app has worked to relax me during the times when I've most struggled to take care of my body's demand for sleep. The mixing feature is lovely because it lets you create your own little world full of sounds at varying volumes. I've tried things similar to this app and never had much/any impact in relaxation. Recommend it as worth a try to others with chronic pain and anxiety.",
            "Lots of different sounds. Many restful (though some are not). A timer can be set, so you save power or just want a nap. Great for drowning out the neighbor's party and if you set it on infinite, it will cover the sounds of the other neighbor's illegal rooster (rooster don't wake people up, people do, right?). The only fault I have found is the strange UI, which has text below the buttons that do not apply to the button.",

That's the most relaxing sound that I know of. Great developer not only added my requested sound, but added some other really good ones, as well. Wish I could give it more stars. Thanks."

            "UPDATE: Though I appreciate the timely response, your response confirms the sound issue. It gives the option of turning the volume down. It doesn't allow you to opt out so the app still sees the the mic\\speaker in use thus not allowing another app to use them. When you try to allow another app to use the sound, the candle app pauses. Does this help explain? Also, def should consider improving the sound options for the candles. Felt very \"cheap\\cheesy\" for lack of better descriptors.",

            "This is an excellent ambient sound app. I have used other apps like this and this one has a good user experience. One idea would be to add a glow to each mixer on the mixer page to indicate when a sound is playing. When doing a mix it is hard to tell which sounds are actively playing and which are not. Having some indicator would be nice.",
            "Nice design, and the sounds are good… However, I don't understand why the same 8 sounds (4 \"fire\" sounds and 4 \"water\" sounds) are repeated on each of the 9 channels—or why there are 9 channels in the first place—or what happened to the other 122 sounds the description mentions—or why my wife likes British detective shows. This app is just another of life's mysteries, but obviously life itself is mysterious. Woo, I'm being profound. I've had coffee, though, so it probably doesn't count.",

This company says it's a Bluetooth technology limitation, if so, it's an old technology. Today's Bluetooth technology allows paring of multiple devices!! Unfortunately it is the only app available for these devices sold by Costco. Hearing devices are Rexton Legato iX.",
            "It is a mission to get the Tinnitus program to respond and only after you try and get the other settings activated and then select the Tinnitus program does it respond. I would think that considering the amount of money I spent on the hearing aids that it would come with decent software. Defenitely will not be using this in the future",
            "I have Uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times and still cannot get the app to work on my phone. It had previously been working and for some reason it stopped. I have checked all the settings on my phone and nothing has changed. I also have a Smart Remote that DOES work. I am running out of options. Help.",
            "My user controls went away! My main reason for using this app was having control over MY hearing devices. No longer can control direction. What the hell was it hurting, why remove it? Guess next time I will have to buy aids from a company that understands these things are MINE and I expect to have full control over them!"

Individual low- & high-pass filters (band-pass). Easy-to-set, coarse sliders & 10Hz-step buttons. Waveform display! CONS: The volume controls system media volume. Can't type in frequencies. No presets. Switching configs (e.g. during binaural beats) is a pain. PS: I'd LOVE to generate arbitrarily-long mp3s of my current config! <3"

            "I would have given this a 5, but the last several weeks (at least every other night) its been shutting itself off at random times during the night or randomly starts going to the next sound even though I have it paused on just the fan. It's really irritating and wakes me up, which is the exact opposite of why I have it in the first place. Please fix this.",
            "It gives me wonderful fan sounds! I especially like the airplane cabin fan - it's one of the fans that I use to drown out the noises my five neighbors (including 3 children) makes above me on a daily basis ... thank you!!!",
            "This is the most AMAZING APP too date... the airplane cabin sound will put you too sleep INSTANTLY!!!",
            "First time I have slept that good in a very long time! So thankful for this app!",
            "It turns off many times n the night. Also changes what is playing and I wake up to restuarant noise and people chattering and clinging silverware even though I have it set on repeat. It does this about every other night. One other thing that really bugs me is as soon as my phone syncs to my car.... the fan sound plays in my speakers even though I've turned it off and went to the battery settings and stopped it from running in the background. Pros... very loud"

You can't beat it. Thank you so much. I can't wait to try it tonight and free!! Beautiful. I'm not sure of question below as just downloaded and listened to perfect sounds!",
            "Seems to work like a miracle! My sleeplessness was getting to me, and I have slept better in the last 2 nights, since using the app, than I have in the past year or so! Thank you to those who created this app!",
            "Honestly, this app is so much better than headspace. I never review things but I just had to for this app. It has so many options for sleep meditation and stories too! The paid version is so worth it too. And if you don't have money they offer free stories (which is different each night) and free meditation. I recommend this to anyone who is tired of headspace with boring monotonous readings. Great app!",
            "Well, just downloaded this a couple days ago. So I'm only just starting to use the app, but so far I'm impressed. It has a great selection. Wish I could see some in for Theta waves, but all else is already in there. Been looking for an app like this. Thanks! P.s... (hint, hint....Theta waves!)"

It wakes me up sometimes and I wish there was a way to turn that off. But other than that, wonderful.",
            "This is a great app. It has very realistic sounds and great sound options. My only complaint is that the app shuts off before the timer ends and sometimes the sound gets staticky. But overall it's a great app.",

        "title": "Binaural Beats Therapy",
        "description": "Binaural beats music is used by people all over the world as a form of ‘brainwave entrainment’ – a process used to entrain the brain into different states that contribute positively to well-being and personal-development.\r\n\r\nWhat most people don’t realize is that although the creation of binaural beats music has only been possible through technological advancement in the last 100 or so years, the use of this natural science dates back thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAncient cultures were aware of how the brain could be entrained through sound repetition well before modern science was able to prove the process.

        "descriptionHTML": "Binaural beats music is used by people all over the world as a form of ‘brainwave entrainment’ – a process used to entrain the brain into different states that contribute positively to well-being and personal-development.<br><br>What most people don’t realize is that although the creation of binaural beats music has only been possible through technological advancement in the last 100 or so years, the use of this natural science dates back thousands of years.<br><br>Ancient cultures were aware of how the brain could be entrained through sound repetition well before modern science was able to prove the process.

The only app using bluetooth to listen through earbuds. Impossible to use for the intended purpose. Update: seems only to fail on the Study program. ADHD ran the entire preprogrammed time without stopping.",
            "I've had this app for a few years, and the Study & Learning track is very effective in helping me focus at work. HOWEVER recently it has started pausing the track whenever my phone screen times out or goes dark. And occasionally even when it doesn't (it just paused in the middle of my writing this review). Makes it kind of useless, no? 2ND EDIT: I FIGURED IT OUT! (at least for my device) I had to adjust Battery Manager to let BB app run in the background! 3RD EDIT: Doing it again. 😒",
            "For those of you dealing with the app getting killed in the background regardless of your battery optimization settings...try Mindroid. This app was amazing for the years it worked, and if it ever gets fixed, I will return to using it...but for now I've settled on Mindroid because for me at least it will continue playing for the duration chosen and now I can finally stay asleep again. I feel bad for mentioning another app here, but if you depend on binaural tones...you need an app that works.",
            "One of the best binaural beats app. It has pre set playlist and you can layer music over it so it's still.playing in the background.",

            "3+ years with no update and a $10 a month price tag for the pro features? Come on, that's ridonkulous.... I love noisli and used it for a long time until they implemented a daily timer, and took away a lot of the features. On top of that when using the android app, I like to a lot of times to play background music with the white noise and that's not possible. It's either one or the other. Noisli you are a shell of what you were when you started in the app and online game. Find a buyer that will be more about the user than your current management that is setting the direction for your brand. Because you guys are losing a fan base quickly..... Abandon ship....",
            "So I paid for the Noisli app a few years back to get it to work across my phone, laptop and chrome extension. It was bare bones but good for what I needed. No bells or whistles. Now I can only listen for 30min ish because there is a daily limit? Um what? You want me to pay monthly for the basic features I have been using for the past few years? Nah, I've already over paid y'all it seems.",
            "I used to really enjoy this app, but in the three years since it was last updated, things have moved on. The biggest issue is it crashes whenever you try to use it in Android P this itself is terrible for a paid for app. There is also no streaming functionality, external speakers can offer a far superior experience than in built phone speakers so being able to cast the sound really is a must now. Hopefully these issues will be resolved soon.",
            "I have been using this app for many years, finding it the best ambient noise solution out there. I especially liked that I could have the same presets on my computer (Chrome extension) that I used on my phone. The app has not been updated in a very long time, but as long as it ran in a stable manner on my devices, I never did care. Now Noisli want a tenner a month from me so that I can continue using the Chrome extension. This removes all extra value this app had for me over great FREE solutions like the Rainforest Connection (rfcx) app. I hope I made my frustration with this nasty betrayal of a loyal customer palpable.",
            "I've owned this app for years and have used it regularly. But now I've got a new device and it no longer works. The app hasn't been updated in over three years. Shame because it still has a lot of potential. Perhaps the developer would prefer I pay for a subscription to their web service instead? No thanks, I'd rather have a new version of this app"

I'm laughing just thinking about it. 😅 The description needs some serious work, too… A few minutes with a native speaker would yield some big improvements.) If you can overlook all that, though, it's quite pleasant.",

            "I have the Signia rechargable hearing aides They work great except for one major problem. They will not let me use my phone to make or receive calls or listen to music without an external speaker. I do have the speaker but it would be so much more convenient for direct connect to my Pixel phone. This app has not been updated in over two years. App will not let me raise volume in only one hearing aid at a time. Frustrated. Thank you Kristine Drumm",
            "When I first got these hearing aids they I worked well. I just had to get used to them. The app that was put on when I first got them allowed me to change the volume separately for the left and right ear. Now the app appears to just change a general sound for both sides. And no you can't just change the volume and think it's going to be the same on each side because it isn't",
            "10/18/2020, I've done everything Signia via email recommended and this app simple does not work. Had my hearing technician reset the app again and still the app will not work. The app simply does not work. It would be very professional of someone if you can get the app working correctly. Please advise what to do. I have a Samgung A50 phone. Thank you. 3/17/2020 Follow up, STIll not working. I followed your advice, didn't solve problem. I would appreciate some help.",
            "bluetooth. compatible is only for iPhone which doesnt help android users. It shouldn't be hard to be able to have a bluetooth compatibility and in always on the phone and this would help out tremendously for the ones that actually prefer androids over iPhones. sorry but not many of us like iPhones as it is. I shouldn't have to buy another phone because of my hearing aids that I pay out of pocket for and have to pay out of pocket for an iPhone as well.",
            "Switching from 1 to 2 is easy. Volume control also works well. Further control such as area covered is nonexistent. You can't direct the sound as you want and eliminate the extraneous sounds from all other sources. For me #1 is useless as it is ruined by any outside source. I find I am restricted to #2 solely. Big disappointment."

            "Definitely what I needed. Waking up to this alarm is alot easier than hitting snooze several times before actually getting out of bed. Using this I'm actually fully awake by the time I set my alarm to get out of bed. The interface seems strange to me, but there is a video when u first open it to show you how to use it.",
            "Tried this for a week and there are too many bells and whistles for me. I'm just looking for calm alarm tones so I don't wake up miserable in this hellhole of 2020. Also, while I get ads, a whole page Facebook ad as soon as you wake up is the opposite of calm. Also, it doesn't save settings easily, so if I go in to change the time of an alarm, I have to also set every little thing back to my liking. Too much for me,but clearly works for others so give it a try to see if it fits.",
            "Exactly what ive been looking for One problem though is that, whenever my phone is below 20%, the no-sound, light-only alarm i set up at sunrise sounds VERY loudly. I use an old phone as alarm clock so its battery sometimes drains. I'd like for it to simply not ring and let the battery empty (like, make it be my choice)",
            "Mornings are so much easier! I'm not hitting snooze AT ALL. I can't imagine waking up to a shocking, obtrusive alarm sound ever again. I have recommended it to coworkers and friends. Why isn't everyone using this alarm??? Great app, thanks Gentle Wakeup!",

I love that I can create my own tones mix my own sound therapy and share it. This was a creative invention and a meaningful app. Thanks for the amazing creation, it has brought me a lot of peace",
            "This is a really neat app. I wasn't sure how the bowls worked at first. I really like the ability to have multiple toned bowls in the pool and be able to choose the background ambiance, water motion and the pool material itself is really cool. I do however suggest maybe some decor like zen items (stacked rocks, bamboo, flowers, etc) in the background or on the rim of the pool to add more immersion, as well as maybe some backdrops. Other than thst I find this app really peaceful. :)",
            "Love this app during lunch at work to make the boss less so. Tried to use it at bedtime, but fell asleep so fast I had no time to enjoy it. The preset poems are wonderfully creative and inspired me to attempt creating my own. I can see a long interactive relationship with this app and out of the box it is fully functional and masterfully designed",
            "Soo nice. I really think this is going to be popular with meditators, the tones are beautiul and the pool is as well. The different gems for the pools is ingenious. I think more work could be done on the ambient part of the ap but good work! I love it!",

            "Definetely not for Huawei users. When the app is opened, the navigation buttons do not appear and there is no way to get out of the app. Instead of the navigation buttons, you get a Google ads bar and when you tap on it too se of the buttons appear, it just opens a Google page. The most annoying thing ever.",
            "This app is amazing especially for headphone users, the mixture of \"white noise\" you can make is astonishing. The developers are also extremely supportive, I contacted them about an issue with it crashing after the startup logo and it was fixed later that afternoon, stellar work!",
            "Similar to other feedback, UI could use some work. The banner ad down the bottom completely covers controls, and when you lock your phone the audio stops. For this reason I can't use, and have uninstalled.",
            "Some lovley sounds but drain your phone battery. Before I went to sleep it was 100% and then, the next morning my phone was dead. Starts off nice but ends a bit rubbish. Plug your phone in if you are going to use this app over night."

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

            "Juat trying it out but I know having audio on blast while talking to someone and/or walking around traffic is something that irritates or endangers yourself. Having an app that keeps you connected with the world is something that might save my life and will keep me in tune with my surrounding environment. So far I'm able to listen to my music and hear someone speak to me. It picks up on things as small as my breathing and relays it through my earbuds so I can listen to my music and hear someone.",
            "This app works amazingly well. It seriously kills all background noises completely & allows me to hear other sounds. Very impressive. Only downside which is the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that you can NOT turn it off at all. Exiting the app won't do it, closing the app won't bit even killing the app. Literally the only way to turn it off is to uninstall it & then I have to reinstall it again when I want to use it again. Please fix this please thank you",
            "This is good but is missing a killer feature, boost mode. If I wanted to I could use this as a hearing aid, but only with the current settings set to their absolute maximum. The option to go even higher would allow one to use this app to help with hearing in a pinch. Haven't seen an app with latency this low on the store.",

This is almost close to the real thing. However a boost to volumes would be nice also, add the Bluetooth microphone options and make the sound match the frequency of it's recoding. Thank you for such amazing app.",
            "Does as advertised, lets u hear surrounding sounds while listening to music on your headphones/earpiece. There is gain control to regulate amount of background noise you hear which is nice. Only gripe is that the app uses the phone mic as opposed to the Wired/Bluetooth earpiece mic, rendering it useless if i want to be able to hear ambient sound while on the go while listening to music at the same time."

            "\"offline\" is in the title, and it truly is. I turned off wifi & data signal & it still works. The sounds are fantastically real, even for coming through a tiny cell phone speaker. No need to sign up, make an account, or purchase anything. As far as ads go, just turn off your screen. Actually & truly free.",
            "Great soothing noise selection - but shuts off randomly. If you need it to be on all night while you sleep, this is not for you. I am a light sleeper, and work opposite schedule from my housemate. Having a continuous sound is what helps my brain relax and sleep, but having it suddenly cut off actually wakes me up from deep sleep. Love this app but can't use it. It doesn't keep doing its one job, and the sudden stops trigger anxiety. Oh well.",
            "Nice! The sounds are quite good. I esp. like the rhythmic \"Wave Crush\" (you probably meant \"Wave Crash\" tho, right?). There are so many nature-sound apps—some, with only ocean sounds—but the waves are almost always constant rather than rhythmic, which is so much more relaxing. Suggestion: It feels jarring how the whole screen moves when you select a sound. How about putting the empty rows at the top and adding sounds there, so everything else doesn't have to jump around?",
            "very calming and helps me with my anxiety, even when im not sleeping :). i really love the addition of sounds that arent entirely natural, like the gentle whir of the fan or the train. id love for an ambient chatter sound, too. the nature sounds are a bit repetitive, though, and could use more variation and spacing out. overall, cute and gets the job done.",
            "The best app I have found to create an individualised combination of nature sounds thats just right. This app gives you lots of choices and so much control its a perfect mindfulness relaxation backdrop."

            "This is my updated review 7/31/2020. I have increased a star. The app is user friendly and easy to use. It is so nice to be able to use my aids as buds. I like the drop down menu to change volume/mode of hearing instead of having to go into the app itself when watching YouTube etc. It does not randomly disconnect as much anymore. I rarely use this app for calls. Battery life is not great 2 to 3 days but that changed after custom molds I was getting 4 to 5 days.",
            "I'm new to hearing aids as of Friday 1/3/2020 and this app. This app was suggested by my audiologist. My list of cons are below for this app. 1. Burns my Motorola Z Force 3 battery down and fast. 2. Really, really wish that I could stream music and link phone calls and texts through my hearing aids which is a big plus with me. 3. Whatever Apple users can do on their cell phones, tablets and iPods, Android users should be able to do the same.",
            "Sure would be nice to be able to answer phone calls through the app. Even just to hear the phone ring would be really nice without having to send more money on a device to connect the two together. When using to control the volume I have to remember if I want to adjust the right side to use the left side of the the phone. The left is the right and the right is the left.",
            "Newest update has screwed everything up. Woke up the other day to find out there's a new update. Now my hearing aids spontaneously disconnect, won't reconnect, won't respond to volume control, and takes forever connect hearing aids when batteries aee changed. Why can't we do everything that Apple users can do. I want to stream music and answer phone calls through my hearing aids.",
            "I would like to see additional functionality for android phones, linking cell phone for calls and streaming media. Similar to what is in the apple app. The functions I have now are pretty much limited to adjusting volume and battery level. UPDATE After using the app for a while, it needs a major overhaul. It randomly disconnects from one or both hearing aids, can't connect at all and I have to restart both aids and the app more than once to get the connection back."

        "comments": [
            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

Bei vielen Menschen entsteht Presbyakusis schon im Alter von ca. 40-50 Jahren und nimmt über das Alter hinweg stetig zu. Bereits ungefähr 50% der über 80-Jährigen unserer Bevölkerung werden mit mindestens einer leichten Form von Presbyakusis diagnostiziert. Oft führt dies dazu, dass die Betroffenen Schwierigkeiten haben, einem Gespräch zu folgen und das Gegenüber zu verstehen. Besonders in Situationen mit vielen Nebengeräuschen wie zum Beispiel in einem Restaurant oder am Bahnhof oder wenn das Gegenüber undeutlich spricht, wird das Verstehen von Sprache umso anstrengender und teilweise fast unmöglich.

Weitere Gründe für Schwankungen können aber auch die Tageszeit, die aktuelle Tätigkeit, die aktuelle Stressempfindung und vieles mehr sein. Viele Menschen können eine gute Einschätzung dieser Schwankungen abgeben und den Zeitverlauf aus dem Gedächtnis rekonstruieren - eine exakte Messung dieser Schwankungen ist damit aber nicht gegeben.

        "comments": [
            "Been playing this game for a couple of months now and still enjoying it. Ads are very short and do not interrupt gameplay. You can also opt for the ad free version. I personally especially like the challenge levels and the opportunity to watch full ads in order to earn rotations which can be saved and help loads if there are no suitable spaces left. A great game. No complaints at all 🏆",
            "Love the game! However, to earn extra rotators you have to watch commercials. Sometimes many many commercials. The commercials are redundant. Based on your online searches, the commercials are geared to your interests. But if you enjoy watching American Girl 5 maybe 10 times in a row, this might be the game for you. They also offer different wood block games and show you those commercials over and over and over again. You would think if they would be a little creative.",
            "Great gamec- I initially liked this game. At first you could get a free rotator every 5 minutes plus a 30 second ad. Now I have to wait for a free rotator every 24 hours. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. I am part of a group of people who download games, test them, and grade them and pass our comments to them who then pass the recommendations on to everybody in the group and then we pass them on to our friends and family. I do not recommend this game in any way whatsoever.",
            "I Love Puzzles!!! Been playing this game for about a year or so and it's always fun and challenging. I enjoy a challenge with games like this! I will continue playing it. Happy to see the feature added of being able to rotate the piece to fit where you want it. Cool! Thanks!! Continue with enhancing the app to be even greater! 🙂",
            "Rubbish app, spent more time restarting app than playing it. The first few days it was fine but as I ran out of rotates I watched a couple of ad's, to get some more, the app never worked correctly after that. It just kept freezing up. Was fun to play but since there are several versions I might try another block game"

            "I'd recommend a way to disconnect the headphones from the app, or maybe see what your headset is connected to, or set priority of connection. Often I connect to my pc and phone. Use the connection to my pc all day then want to watch netflix on my phone in bed. Guess what, pc is still in control, but you can't kill the connection from the app, so I have to run down to my desktop or I can't hear my phone.",
            "I just bought the Evolve 75e product. Not sure why it isn't supported on this app. Would be nice if it would be so I could update firmware and manage my device. The product is great, great sound and easy to setup and use. Update: In the app if you don't connect a device you can't get into the about section of the app, or at least I am not seeing any way to get to about.",
            "After rocking the Active 65t I bought the 75t this summer. Love them, and since a week there's Active Noise Cancelation too! The app is great and has improved massively, less crashes and like every other earphone maker should have: an equalizer! One thing I'd like to suggest: There are a few default \"Moments\", like My Moments, Commute and Focus. I'd like to be able to have different ANC profile and attach them to the different Moments. In my home the noise is different from the noise in my car, so is it possible to add custom ANC profiles to the different Moments? That would be awesome! Keep up the great work! That's why I didn't switch to other headphones/earbuds ;-)",
            "Jabra Elite 85h: Connection was very easy and fast. The app has a neat and tidy design. All options are easily accessible and understandable. The EQ works well and I love the option to be able to turn off the Voice-Playback when changing modes. I haven't experienced any problems so far. Will update this review if and when necessary.",
            "Since the last update when I open the app is stuck on the \"choose your headset from the list\" screen. I choose my headset (75t) and go to Bluetooth settings (where they are already paired). I close the app and open again and im back on the menu to choose headset with no way back to the welcome page. Iv tried reinstalling and repairing. Tried with my second phone with no issues."

I want an app that have the OM and beta waves I was using another one of your apps last year but you deleted beta waves from it and you suggested some other apps which one of them was this. But it has everything but OM sound sayings Can you help me please I would live to have the previous app with beta waves which you putted music instead of it. I would love it to have both music and beta waves. The app name was solfegio frequencies chakra healing",
            "the ads are annoying simply because ads are annoying.. the app itself is wonderful though, AND free (hence the ads). 3-5min through each tone does help to clear my mind while giving me an overall sense of well-being. the pure tones with no music have me using only this app.",
            "I like the concept, just wish you can play them in combination or all at once depending on personal specific needs. Then it would be a 5 star app.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I love this game, but, they only allow you 12 free tickets every 40 minutes or so. It costs at least 4 tickets to play 4 cards in a round. So, this 12 tickets yet burned up pretty fast. And, who wants to stop playing and have to exit the game and wait 40 minutes for more tickets??? It's a hassle! So, when you run out of tickets, they offer in ad purchases to buy more tickets, and that's where they get you. I have not found a bingo game that is actually free to play. It's a shame!!!",
            "ADDICTED!!!!!! I wish you would put an option in to use our coins to be able to buy at least 10 tickets. I'm a poor 49 year old with a son who plays 2 sports a senior in high school and a daughter who just graduated college and needed a reliable car. So I gave her mine, since she's an elementary school teacher and needs to mold the minds of the future game designer's who will take your jobs in the future..... Damn sorry to ramble on, let me buy tickets with coins. Respectfully, A broke Dad. Lol",
            "Playing higher level now. Fun, but having fewer bingos, than when I had played for the first time. The reason I stopped this game, before, was cause I got tired of seeming to be forced to buy things to progress. I became angry an frustrated. Time will tell if I put up with this for long. Hate to stop. But I will. Their second chance will end. Will update.",
            "By far the best bingo game I've played! The tutorial when starting the game is very helpful. So many options for avatar and dauber. The voice call outs are different from room to room which makes it more entertaining. The leveling up rewards are great. Not interrupted with ads. Not required to spend money (available if you want to). Only drawback is that your account doesn't work on multiple devices.",
            "This is the only Bingo app I play. You don't have to use real money if you can't afford to. The graphics are neat and there's lots of 'rooms' to play. One of my favorite things is how all the callers sound different. Some times there are one or two callers that have a thick accent, but it's easy to watch the 'boards foe which number is called."

            "I absolutely love this app! Moving away from the big tech companies is doing this human really good!! I don't like to be influenced in my advertising or my feeds. Nobody gets to manipulate me! every time I search I get exactly what I'm looking for and even more articles than Google would have ever provided! The best part is it's private! Nobody's sharing my information! Tell your friends take control of your life!!",
            "I've been using this for quite awhile now & have made it my default browser. I love the privacy aspect- especially now that we're in the middle of the election. I don't get the SPAM emails that I do if I use the typical Android browsers. DDG has all of the functionality that other browsers do but the best one is being able to delete my browsing data without a trace, & it auto blocks cookies( which media & shopping sites don't like, but I think it's great.) It's also very user friendly.",
            "I've been using this browser for 1 1/2 years with no problems until 2 weeks ago. When I tried to login to a site I use regularly I got a message saying it doesn't support Safari 4 and I keep getting this message since then. I could use chrome, but I don't want to. I sent 2 emails to the developers last week. They haven't replied. Disappointing! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Didn't solve the problem. If I had gotten a reply from technical support I would have rated it a 5.",
            "All it really needs is a built in ad blocker and it would be the best private browser you'll ever really find. Its speed makes it an amazing \"default\" browser for quick use, and the ability for it to automatically erase your data after a period of inactivity is priceless! But until it can block ads, I still have to primarily use other browsers for YouTube and leisure browsing. Without that important function (which is a basic standard today), it still falls under a very niche browser.",
            "Wowser Browser! DDG allows me options that none of the others do. For example, it allows copy & paste a host of things with ease much like Chrome without the peeking over your shoulder cookie monsters. It isn't such a hassle to save your favorite/ most visited sites. Sounds simple enough. But to my frustration with the exception of a few browsers, you have to literally manually save a site that you just want the browser to open up to automatically. I love DDG!"

            "It's a shame that this game doesn't give you the coins you win. Played the daily challenge for 30 days and won the 200 coins, yet I didn't get them. Tried to contact them but the have no direct message. There is no use playing if you're going to cheat me out of the winnings. Also need to work on the words. There have been many words that you say no that are.....",
            "Great game which is addictive, I play this all the time because it is simple yet fun. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because there is one improvement which would be good to see in this game; and that would be an option to change colours of the block and background. Having played the game more 100s of times, seeing the same colours does make it dull. If this small update was implemented, it would make a huge difference.",
            "I am giving this a low rating because of all the ads and the fact that you can get rid of them for 4 bucks but thats just for 30 days. Seriously???? Also the landscape never changes even though in the ad it showed green grass which looked cool. Shame on you devs. Where are the levels in the pictures and trailer? It's a great game but it's the same thing over amd over again.",
            "Not what was advertised when It was an ad, I saw ad and was like woah that looks like a fun little game so I downloaded quickly without investigating, only to find this completely different game so for that I give a 1star. But it's a fun game so 5 star. DO NOT LIKE BEING TRICKED HOWEVER. Shame on you if you're in control of false advertising. But a fun game so I'm conflicted.",
            "The music is peace allowing you to think ,no time presure,which allows you to relax,and the background pic is beautiful. No ads intrupt while your trying to think.So if you like block puzzles I highly recommed trying this one."

I also love that you can hear the turn by turn directions with out having to pay. It's a safe thing to not always need your eyes on you phone to know where your going. To generate a random route is super easy too for a quick get up and go ride. I have gotten rid of all other apps. I'm keeping this one❤️!",

Frustratingly, that was not made clear prior to the requirement to make an account. Disappointing practices. Email sent to have account details deleted from their systems. Edit: 1* got your attention and will remain. Take this as feedback regarding the login requirement. I'm really not interested in jumping though hoops...",
            "Fun app but it does not have a lot of specific addresses or locations. Example: you want to go to a specific restaurant chain, it won't find it or the closest one. But I guess it was not meant for that. Still, it is fun to use for random rides.",

            "Overall, this is one of the best apps I've used for motorcycle navigation! I have one tissue that keeps me from giving it five stars. When doing turn-by-turn navigation, it does not display the street name that you're supposed to turn on. This makes it a little confusing especially when there are a bunch of streets next to each other. Other than that, great app!"

The stupid bucks are so hard to get, rewards take ages and dollars, and even the farm town part is totally a rip-off. On top of that, they don't allow you to watch vids for things.

            "Great game...BUT! Had issues with this game a year ago, but thought I'd give it another go. Graphics and game play are excellent, however I bought credits (AU$70), bet big, won free games (Where's The Gold) then the game froze. Restarted it, recovered the game then froze again. Restarted it, same thing. Third time it just took the free games. No reply from support. You bet big with the hope of winning free games, then it takes away your prize.",
            "This app has the best graphics....but thats it. I've tried buying credits etc to 'pay my way' for better payouts, but all Product Madness are concerned about is making you pay more for something worthless. There is no way you can win any money back, its supposed to be for fun, but you have to pay big ongoing premiums to have any 'fun'. Until l see a better return on the money I've paid so far, they'll not get another penny out of me. You are better off saving your money for real gambling.",
            "I keep wanting to give this game more stars, but they just wont let me. Yes I'm very happy that you put way better values on the daily wheel. Yes I play this game because the games are ones I've played in real casinos...i can't give more than one star because you just make it impossible to win anything...when you go through 5 million coins betting minimum and never get a bonus or win anything higher than double your bet you just want to give up. Plus, the cost of buying coins is ridiculous.",
            "I think its great , you know it costs them money to put these games on here, so to anyone that's not happy just remember these games are free, and entertaining , And it takes our minds off of today's problems, Tomas blanco",
            "Total scam. Fixed games and they expect you to pay for credits? Games don't pay, stupid and totally unnecessary side games (open boxes for items or scratch fixed lottery tickets). The only good thing about this app is that the games look like the real deal but the overall experience is terrible."

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "I keep using the app often. However, it has many bugs to be fixed. The smart coach shows sessions I did as not done. The time is off by a day so I cannot start my training at the correct day. The contact link connects to a share experience link instead. So how to contact you directly? Navigation through the app is not intuitive and it is congested with a lot of ballast. I'd appreciate very much a simplified version that is more straightforward to use.",
            "Smart Coach was available for silver members. Now they have changed it only for gold members. It is like changing the game rules during the game. May be they will take away other things!!! Very poor taste of business. Although I love the app, I am thinking of switching to the other app just for this reason. Lack of business ethics, and in a yoga app. Another issue with the program. Now they have created a schedule to schedule a program. But there is no reschedule option for the missed days. 😭",
            "The programs and variety are good, but the app is bad. Buggy, and the material you want to get to - ie sessions - is difficult to get to. Constant ads and notifications you can't turn off, even with the Gold subscription, and the support staff's response is either ignoring criticism or suggesting you delete your account. Would suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "This is the best yoga app I have ever tried and worth every penny if you choose to become a gold member. I tested it for a while now. I get usually bored easily with the same routine and this provides loads of options including levels, specific needs, length, time of day, goals,... The list is long and easy to organize with favorites and home page featured workouts. I will be renewing my subscription for sure!",
            "This was my very first time trying yoga, and this was my first session... as a beginner I think it went pretty well. Could really feel my muscles stretching on some of those poses. But I was afraid I wasn't going to hear what the pose was correctly so I tried to keep my phone within eyesight so I could watch the instructor, but I think once I get the hang of it I won't need to look at my phone anymore and I can concentrate more on my poses."

I have actively sourced another suduko game that has virtually no ads whatsoever. Thanks for your reply, However, my account WAS AD FREE, until I was advised I needed to update. I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",
            "Great game but a big memory hog and it has to stay on device, there is no option to move it to SD Card. Also, more time spent watching Ads than playing time. I play from the UK and the Non-representational Ads shown are banned by UK Trading Standards. It's on its way off my device ... UNINSTALLED.",
            "I am so furious! I subscribed for premium for a year and it worked for 3 days. I'm back to getting all the bloody annoying ads every few minutes. I hate it!! And the worst thing is there is no way to report it or contact them.",
            "Used to be great, but now the aggressive ads have killed it. I finish a puzzle in two minutes just to get hit with 2 back-to-back ads. I don't mind some advertising, but it's overkill now.",
            "The app was fine until they got all political. All the commercials have been for one party, like the are trying to jump on the main stream media ban wagon and shove the democratic party down everyone's throat. No thank you and I'm deleting the app. You can keep your one sided opinion."

            "Interesting, always changing and always a challenge.Eady enough to enjoy playing right away but sufficiently difficult to keep you thinking and developing strategies.",
            "Liked it, played every day challenge, but now cannot get any rotation options, always says network error, even when on wifi. Stopped playing cause can't win without being able to rotate",
            "Good game BUT ads. 30 second ad to start a game. 30 second ad to finish a game. If you minimize this game to check texts or phone, another 30 second ad to resume. So a minimum of one minute in ads. I like the daily challenges but on this game I have not figured out what it takes to win a game. It appears that you have to complete a game about 30 times before it counts as completed. It is an good game if you have a lot of spare time and not much else to do."

I was able to get through to the 7 day free trial but it won't let me color any premium pictures because I \"don't have premium\" and it won't let me select another option. I went and cancelled my trial and went back to try again and still nothing. I'm sorry, but it's unethical to take a form of payment from someone for a premium service and then not deliver on said service, even if it has a one week free trial.",

That would be the reason I never gave a 5 star rating, and i hope that these instances do not happen any more. Other than that I highly recommend trying the app.",
            "It's really fun but I can't figure out how to silence the noise for coloring (the tapping not asmr) other than silencing my phone and it's really annoying coz I like listening to my music while playing. Other than that the app runs well with lots of different pictures and a dark mode. I'd recommend. If I get a way to mite the sounds I'll give a 5 star.",
            "I love the App but it can use a few new features to improve the app/game that I would recommend are; 1. Finding a picture/creation by the color most used in it. Like if you where to want to find only stuff that is blue for example. 2. A more clean light/dark/automatic themes. 3. A way to filter out works you had already colored. 4. When creating a work of your own it would be nice to have different sizes in stead of the one size. Ex. Large, Medium, and/or Small. Please consider this thanks!",
            "Great fun! I can colour when I'm bored, draw when I want and it even helps when I'm feeling a bit down because it is relaxing... Also, I love the double tap because it saves time! Just a bit confused - I think double tap filler should start enabled instead of having to open the settings menu to enable it. I But still love it!!! I'm kinda sad though... I made my own pixel art but when I restarted my phone, I signed in, but all my pics weren't there. I worked hard on those but now they are gone 😢"

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

In fact, find another time filler because you won't fill time on here. You'll just be very unsatisfied with the game. Boycott.",

            "This app is absolutely incredible. It has so many drawing and you can create your own drawing. On my second day I colored 5 drawings already. This app is just fantastic. I always get new awards. However, there are so many adds. Which I do not like. I absolutely hate it. Although, all the adds do remove but you have to pay money. It was a fantastic app. I really love the app. I would be shock if anyone rated this a one star. I just cannot believe that.💙💙💙😀",
            "Really good, I was having problems with a other paint by number and it got a little boring so I decided to get this one. This never gets boring for me and has so many puzzles. I also like how it is divided in different genres, it makes it easier to find what I want to do and find specific things that may be hard to see. There is just one problem: I allowed my camera and It still won't let me make custom art, very sad but it's only one problem which I can get from other pixel art apps so it's ok.",
            "Honestly, this game has to be one of my favorite apps in my phone! It just makes me feel so creative and happy. When I'm a little bit sad or maybe just bored, I play this game and it just makes me feel so happy! Also, just to point out, when the other pictures, like, is kinda special, you can just watch an ad and its free! Well, despite the other option which is to get the premium, its fine! So, I am highly reccomending this game to kids, teens, adults, every age!",
            "I absolutely love this game. There are many kinds of drawings to color . I love that the game has different categories to chose from. If you want to color a special drawing it takes 1 add to get it, Well for me it does. I color at least 15 drawings a day. This game is a calming game and a relaxing game. This game is a great game to play in quarantine too. THE END",
            "I love this game, dont get me wrong. Though there is this issue that happens quite a lot when I'm coloring in pictures. I'll be filling/coloring in a picture of something and then there will be a color missing. And I cant find it even when I click the bulb to find it it cant, and then I cant finish the coloring page. Hope you can fix that. 😐"

            "This is the absolute best slots game, that I have ever played. The graphics, in the games are unique and the wins play better than all so far. I find myself playing for hours when I have the coins to do so. When you win a large jackpot it makes it harder to put down. Still playing for hour's on my favorite game. I recently deleted 4 other games, because they don't compare.",
            "Fun and addictive. But you run out of free coins really fast!!! It would be nice if they would offer more ways to earn them. Once you run out of free spins, which is REALLY fast, you have to buy coins to play!!! It sux!!! And if you're like me, you know that to win more you HAVE to do a MAX BET!!! That is where they get you!!! You use up all of your free spins this way!! THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE SPINS!!! DONT GET SUCKED IN LIKE I DID!!! IT ISN'T WORTH IT!!!!",
            "Played for months, spent probably around $1,000 on packages...having fun. I understand it is a play-to-win game and so I had no problem making the occasional purchase - but recently their greed has just gotten to be too much. The way the game is programmed to purposely work against you to force more purchases has taken any fun or sense of the excitement out of the game. They aren't even coy about it; it's just blatant and irritating. I won't be spending another penny on any Playtika games.",
            "Here we go again with the app doing more cool features which causes loading issues that go on for months. Always the same advice to uninstall and reinstall which does nothing. It seems this always happens close to tournaments ending so you can't reach the grand prize. Also too many contests going on at the same time, so you are being forced to play. Just what are these \"cool features?\"",
            "Everything in this online casino is about trying to get you to spend money on air. Everytime you switch games you have to navigate through 6 ads begging for money. Enough is enough. One ad is ok two is tollerable but so many ads begging for money is insane. If I was to spend money at an online casino it would be one where I have a chance to win real money. Sorry ceasers but your online casino is well below par in my view."

            "Ever since the new Halloween game, the game is not playable. It's so glitchy and lags so bad that you can't even tell what you're clicking on. I tried restarting my phone, clearing the cache from the game, freeing up some space and it's still horrible. Asked other club members if it's been acting that way for them too and they said yes. Not playing anymore until the issue is fixed.",
            "i like this game so far. but i've submit my email a lot of times and i never get the verification link. sometimes it doesn't give me the rewords from the game. i contact support 2 times and i didn't get any answer! i think that they just want to make us pay for keep playing i did it once and since then i stop recieving coins from advertisements! probably i will delete it in a while. that's all i have to say about this game!",
            "I am playing the Bingo challenge,and when I go to purchase a chest or power ups etc. It freezes and I cannot get back to the game I've lost so many useful power ups in this game and by the time I get back to the game I missed several numbers,I've spent a ton of money 💰 on this game I love this game so much by I'm seriously thinking o deleting my google game account and trying other game site,You guys are really getting expensive too!!!",
            "Hi! I am reviewing this game I gave it a five stars originally. I spend a lot of money every month on this game and enjoy playing it. However you don't always get the treasure boxes, the correct amount of bingo cards, and when you collect your food items the percentage doesn't go up the movie up to the next level. I also participate the treasure chess competition and a lot of the times it doesn't count all my treasure chest which is frustrating. I have updated the newer version.",
            "I really love this game and it is super fun and I love the club I lead but after spending well over $100 of my real money on the game it is frustrating that the game just sometimes kicks you out of matches. Yes i get the bingo tickets back but all the powerups that were used are never returned. I have seen where someone else wrote a review with the same complaint and was told to clear their cache... No I am sorry this is happening to many people and I am over it. Your issue not ours, fix it."
