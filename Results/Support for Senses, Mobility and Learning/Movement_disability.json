            "More of a pamphlet or a book than an app. This shouldn't be listed under apps. There is nothing to interact with other than turning pages. Had it been listed as a book, it would have been more accurate. However, had it been listed under books, I would have been disappointed as it is only 7 pages long. It is seven useful pages, in that it shows hand drawn pictures of what to do for each exercise so I will not give it one star. When I was done paging through the pamphlet I looked for anything clickable or a menu for additional functionality but there was nothing else to it. Overall, if I were an instructor for an application class,I would give this a D- barely passing. It's packaged as an app, installs as an app and you can turn pages. Disappointing.",

I loved this app until the most recent update. It was the only fake GPS app that didn't \"snap back\" to your actual location periodically. That is, until, this most recent update. Now, every few seconds it goes back to my actual location and then back to the fake location. Please resolve this issue. Thank you.",

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "In response to Plop😀 Instead of baking the perfect poo after food I love, maybe \"perfect plop\" , \"normal\" , \"ideal\", the picture is the best way to \"match \" to the description anyhow. You could name it Bob! Great except that the description for a normal poo is SAUSAGE .. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE MY FOOD DESCRIBE MY POO!! GROSS! I JUST DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. I WISHED I COULD BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE ASSOCIATION IS NOT COOL!! OTHERWISE I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!",
            "Hi, I loved the app and have been using for weeks but unfortunately I just opened the app and it was completely empty - all my data I've been working hard to input for weeks is gone as if I am a brand new user - it even said welcome to the app when I opened it this morning. :( I definitely didn't reset anything so am really perplexed as to what happened and why it lost all my data suddenly.",
            "I like the application. Nice fratures especially the analyzer and learn. I would like to suggest for improvement, it would be nice to have an account for this so my logs will be saved and if I change my phone or use other devices, I wouldnt worry about losing my data. I can export the data but that would become a raw data and not analyzed. Importing data and saving thru google drive would be added value. Overal, good app. Thank you for this application. Its a great help. 🙂",
            "Is good for tracking but I have a serious problem and was tracking for my next doctors appt and lost all the previous months data. Not sure if this app just does a month at a time and doesn't save month to month. If you need long term tracking may not be the one",
            "A good tracking app with lots of entry options. It is early days in my use (<2 weeks) but the analyser seems to be good too. Would proably get 5 if it also had time tracking ability and perhaps more IBD symptoms such as pain/flatulence/pus/spasms."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

Like 4.99 and 10.99 or 35.99$ for some people that can be alot and that's just if you want TO SAVE the video YOU MADE. But there is some really cool templates. But I really wish I could of given this app a 5 star or at least a 4 star but no I had to give it a 3 stars. :(",
            "This app is great! It exports your videos very quickly, but I'm giving this a 4 star review because it doesn't really let you pick the music you want, it already gives you music with a type of style. Then again, this app is amazing and doesn't cost money to do the videos, so great job :)",
            "I just downloaded this app and it seems pretty cool and fun but it's already having some issues and it's only been five minutes. I picked out a few photos for a video and after pushing play the music in the video started skipping right away it only played part of it then kicked me out.",
            "This truly is a great app I realised that you don't exactly have to pay for everything even though there is a pro option it's perfectly fine because you don't have to pay for it and a lot of the templates are actually just for Free really good and you can remove the watermark too",
            "Extreamly beautiful app i have ever seen before for beat edting... But i suggest please add the favourite option in which users can add their favorite templates. And search option As well. Such an amazing Application. 😘😍 Thank you"

Playing the game is now even more enjoyable! Update now and see for yourself.<br><br>We have been working really hard to improve the game for you, so do not forget to leave your comments! Thank you for staying with us!",

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

Steps doesn't work as a goal if you are doing your exercise in a gym or on a bike, and that's before we get to the fact that it is completely excluding many disabled people. Bring back move minutes as an option when setting your goals.",
            "I bought the oppo watch. I am upset with Google fit on the Wrar OS by Google. Google fit has a lot of issues with background mode. It can lose steps and heart tate. The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",
            "This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",
            "Perfect app tht I use as a widget on my home screen. I religiously update any recordings I take offline and is a kind of my health journal, that I can review and make some assessment. I had seen great pointers that helped me to predict something going wrong and seek timely medical help. I helps you to be more disciplined. I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",
            "I've taken up the Dubai Fitness Challenge this year ( today being the 1st day) and to keep up with the challenge, I use the Fastrack Reflex app to calculate my daily steps while I go for my walks/runs. But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

            "App worked great for the first couple of months. Now it won't track my steps. And if it does, it says that NONE of them are convertible. I've also had a lot of issues with steps being converted to sweat coins (it will track that I've walked 12,000 steps but only convert 100). I sent a request for help and never got a reply. Read one of the responses to a review and you guys tell people to submit tickets but you have an automated message respond saying that they pretty much never check it. Wth.",
            "Love this app, its not easy to build sweatcoins but if you save them you can earn some pretty cool stuff. I walk a ton for work so its generally easy to accumulate them. The offers update every few days so it always feels fresh. They also have awesome humanitarian causes you can donate your coins to. I would rate this app 10/5 if I could. Its engaging yet not overwhelming, one of my favorites i constantly recommend the app to my friends and coworkers",
            "Please fix my account. I have exactly 938,814 steps that keep adding up and wont caluculate to the sweatcoins. I have the right setting and everthing and no battery saver or anything. Im not sure if there is a problem with the app or if they are just scamming me when my coins actuly start to add up after 2 years.(update) i uninstalled and reinstalled and its counting again but i lost the 938,814 steps that never got calculated. Is there a way you could put these back onto my account.",
            "Whenever I use this app or hit 2× boost it starts counting steps then it will stop like every 10 to 15 sec for at least 20 sec at a time , the timer is stil going but not counting the steps . I am 67 yrs old and was so excited about this app . Some days its so hard to get started excercising but I make myself so I can stay fit. Please fix this !!!",
            "I've been a loyal sweatcoin user for over 2 years with no issues until recently. The app will continuously stop tracking my steps for no reason. I've re-installed multiple times and it never seems to work. Some days it decides to track my steps though. It's inconsistent, I already contacted support through the app and they didn't do anything to help or seem to care. I do over 15,000 steps per day and I've been subscribing to their 30 coin/month and it's basically been a complete waste."

            "Great App it works in the background and this appears to be done randomly. I say that because every so often I will get a report on my phone stating the number of Apps which are safe. Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

I am a huge fan but, while I appreciate your need to create revenue, the addition of ads that play sound before you even get to the ad is simply infuriating, and is leading me to consider uninstalling. I really do not want to do this, but I cannot fathom how you thought this was in any way a good idea. Please remove the ads with sound. Honestly, get rid of this garbage or watch this die. \"We try to limit these ads\" like hell you do. Lip-service",
            "One of my most used apps, one of the only ones that puts a smile on my face (most of the time). The ads arnt too bad, all except the ones that plays music and is animated. Whoever allowed those to pop up and dissables my music or youtube running on the background has a special place in hell for them 🙂🖕",
            "The app functions well, but half the memes are political and not very funny. I would love to use this app, but I am uninstalling it because I don't look at memes to hear endless political views. I think myself and the majority of users want the moderator to accept less political memes and more that are funny to everyone, regardless of their polictical preference. Otherwise, a filter option would be helpful to sort through categories of memes and avoid political ones.",
            "Epic app, except for august 1st, but there is something im not happy with on it, every now and then on gallery it will only show memes from august 1st (on august 1st every meme gets past moderation) and it kinda sucks since august 1st memes usually suck",
            "Was a great app loved it untill recently when the added ads which were easy to pass over untill a few days later when the ads started playing music even when they weren't on screen."

            "The preference settings do not work. You will be shown people 1000s of km away. They try to say it's a filter thing, as if I would not be smart enough to test out if my filters were the limiting factor. Not 1 user of *any* broadly defined \"filter parameter\" exists in my city of 1.6 M ppl. If I use the premium \"global search\" feature (which does in fact exist) to then search any specified area, it will ALWAYS show people far away from that area. This problem is not on my end.",
            "The app is a scam, free version gets you nothing but spam, paid version they literally just took my money and didn't provide the premium service, which I paid for 1 year. When I contacted customer support over this, they stated they do not have any payment on file. Proof was provided, and the customer service responded with \"sorry nothing we can do\"",
            "Can only upload pics from the camera app on the device, or Facebook. The pics I want to use don't exist on either, so pretty much useless. Edit: thanks for the tip, but that's definitely not the issue. I haven't even tried uploading because I can't access the pics I want to use. They're not on Facebook or my phone's camera app.",
            "This app is truly terrible. On first impressions a few months ago I had more faith in the app because I was surprised with how many people were shown living at least 20-50 miles from my area. But now after you've viewed somewhere in the 200s of people's accounts near your area, they suddenly can only show people who live almost 100 miles away from you, regardless of how long you've been off the app for. Don't know if they stop showing new accounts near us on purpose or just a glitch....Just sad",
            "Waste of time. There's no matches anywhere close no matter what you set the radius for. They were unhelpful with contacting saying to just restart the app and that if there aren't people near me that the default is to ignore the radius.... I don't want to talk to someone 700 miles away. And they try to make you pay for everything! Just wow."

I especially love the \"Animation\" feature, however, I don't see why it loops the way it does, (Ex. I try to make a bus move. Instead, it warps the bus a ton, and it looks like it is a rubber bus, and that a giant with invisible arms is twisting it. Otherwise, this is a great app!",
            "First it was nice. Tutorial was easy. But I got a bug. The picture I recently finished editing covered my entire phone screen. As if it has been an overlay wallpaper but I couldn't see anything. It stayed in the screen. I tried locking and unlocking but it's still there. I can press applications other random applications behind the pic but it kept staying there. Had to restart and uninstall",
            "Pretty Cool App. I'm glad you can buy it out right if you want. I went with the $20 for a year option. I think it's worth it if I use it allot and I think I will. It has some great effects. I'm impressed with how well it masks my subject in the foreground from the background. It's pretty easy to get up and running with this. I'm having allot of fun with it right now. I'm doing product shots and bringing them to life with this. It's pretty cool. 😎👍 Edit, love the new overlays and updates! 🙂👍",
            "Let's get something straight, it's not a completely free app. However, when you buy the premium, it's worth it! I've literally gained thousands of fans on my Facebook page, \"The Rise: Story of Trunks.\" If you go on that page, you'll see the work put in solely using this app. They just need to add more options like being able to add more than four element selections and more \"overlay's.\" Besides that, it is a five star rated app.",
            "I Love the app! I'm going into my second year using premium and its worth it for what i use, and perfect for what i do... The only real complaint i have is PLease, give us an option to FLIP THE ASSETS. for now we have to leave the selected asset in the developers original position. yes We can turn them and change sizes, but if the option to flip it from side to side and up or down, that would solve my only issue with this app. Thanks also for adding useful unique assets regularly."

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

This time around you’ll be happy to hear that we’ve crushed a bunch of bugs.

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

            "Can't log into my account anymore. I've played for 6 years with no problems, now in the last 3 weeks I've had more issues than I can count trying to log in. I've rebooted my phone, I've cleared my cache, I've turned off my VPN, I've cleared my junk files and my residual files with Norton Clean, and I've deleted the game and reloaded it, NOTHING WORKS.",
            "At first it was okay, $4.99 packs then $19.99 packs to help you advance, now mostly everything is $100 packs. I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. 👎",
            "Have played this game for a number of years getting very discouraged game will load for a day then close spontaneously during the loading process. They tell me its my phone but when others have the same issue. I'm seeing they only want money not fix the issues I'm down grading my stars to a 2 because of technical issues without fixes and it has evolved to a pay to play, pay to win game.",
            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",
            "I played this game all the time on my samsung phones. Very fun game to keep up with. Now I'm on my oneplus 7 pro and nothing loads other than the all text boxes and buildings. I can't transfer my account because I don't know what I'm pressing. This is one of few games I have spent money on, I'd like to not lose that account."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

Update October 28: Now you can't even upload pics because it's says the permissions are incorrect, even though they are correct. How useful is a dating app that won't let you upload pics?",
            "Nothing free about this, from the moment you sign up, they're trying to pry your wallet open. You can't see who likes you or who is messaging you (unless they're paying). If you want to do a subscription service, just do a subscription service. Don't tell people it's free when it's not. Even the worst freemium apps give you some time, but this app hits you with a paywall within 30 mins of signing up. The other dating apps are bad, but this is the worst of the lot.",
            "From 5 stars to one! The latest version is so buggy as to be almost unusable. It takes now takes an inordinate amount of time to go from Alerts to Carousel, and from writing a message back to a picture. Writing a message does not show up in a timely manner. More errors exist but you get the idea. Do yourselves a favor, reissue the previous version!",
            "I have just paid £25 for a months subscription which is supposed to include unlimited messages but other than \"liking\" someone's profile I can't send any written messages. Also just found out the \"liking\" is also limited to a certain number a day & everything I try to do I am hit with a upgrade message wanting more money from me. Is £25 for the month not enough for you? Obviously not because for that £25 I have nothing!",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

You can now track a run with a GPS-enabled watch alone.<br><br>All stats tracked with your watch will sync with the app on your phone. That means you’ll be able to see mapped routes after you save.",
        "comments": [
            "I used to really love and enjoy this app. However during last 4 months, quality of tracking activities went from bad to worse. It says I'm in the good GPS coverage area and then it starts measuring activity after 5-7 min or so (or after 1-1.5km). There are some days when it's better, but generally it's really sad. The same goes for notting down running 10 km, but not taking account that you also ran 5 km to achieve that.",
            "Overall I enjoy the features, especially having the audio voice at intervals to tell me how far and fast I'm going. However, fairly often the voice will cut off or give me an incorrect measurement. For example, if I'm going faster than the set pace itll say I'm behind my pace. Same for the opposite, if I'm going slower than the set pace, it'll tell me I'm faster..",
            "I have been using this app for 7Y now (4y paid) to track my runs. Last year I switched to a paid membership w/Strava and came back to RunKeeper not too long ago. There has been no change to this app. I've stopped using it to track during my runs because gps is way off so I rely on my Garmin watch. This means I don't get any of the voice features which I used to love. It's also very frustrating that I can't link a run to training plan after its completed. You're seriously sending me to desktop?!",
            "As with many of the reviews on here, I would have to agree that the quality of this app has decreased greatly over the last year or so. It very rarely will even log an entire workout without the app crashing. I use one of the newest phones on the market so there should be no issue. I've attempted to reinstall hoping that that would resolve the crashing issues but that has not been successful.",
            "I have used Runkeeper over 7 years with 4-5 Star results. This year it became difficult to work with. Workouts just stopped recording for or the GPS would drop out and just leave me a straight line. Efforts to edit these workouts no longer worked on my Windows 10 PC so I tried my wife's MacBook and I couldn't edit on it either. I researched solutions online and tried everything suggested none of it worked. I contacted customer support. The reply was: its not a priority for us at this time."

            "The game is good, but while youre in the game the car feels weightless specially in multiplayer mode. Once you've been hit by another car, you'll just fly into the air like the car has no weight at all. Plus, if you drift in corners and you are hit by other car you will loose your grip and driftline. I don't know if you guys, the developer is playing jokes on making a drift game on mobile to earn money. Learn to make a good game first before selling us anything. For now, fix it!",
            "This game is a lot of fun, the controls are smooth and it's not gimmicky, the cars function like normal, like if you go to fast into a corner you will understeer and the hand break isn't a \"push to drift button\" like other games, I hope the dev is working on more content cause this game is so much fun. My only complaint is that the game is quite grindy with all the different things you have to do to get all the stars each race.",
            "This game so far has impressed me very much. Not Forza graphics, but they are amazing for a 121 Mb game. There are 15 cars you can buy! (In game or cheap purchases with real money) I think there are 3 or 4 maps. (For single Player) So you do a practice run, and then you race with AI. For multiplayer, you need to collect 20 stars, which will take you about 10-20min to unlock. It is very fun. You can get upgrades with your money, buy new cars, get paint jobs and more. In game you can get boost 2x",
            "Almost perfect rally game. If possible I would rate more than 5 stars. Really good controls and graphics. Only in future updates I would like to see more realistic damage on the cars. And maybe another track - a city track for instance. Overall this is the best rally game I played from play-store. Keep on developing this game please!",
            "Love new track in canyon. But new update had bug. I know don't just for me or other else had this problem, the handbrake can't engage when where necessary. They didn't work so well when we still on acceletor and want to using handbrake or brakes. It's need to tap twice also cause lag of reaction make me crash. Old version perform this thing so well. Maybe you guys can fixed this. Btw, still excellent game ever"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

        "recentChanges": "Introducing a brand new Android Wear 2.0 experience! Leave your phone at home. You can now track a run with a GPS-enabled watch alone.<br><br>All stats tracked with your watch will sync with the app on your phone. That means you’ll be able to see mapped routes after you save.",
        "comments": [
            "I used to really love and enjoy this app. However during last 4 months, quality of tracking activities went from bad to worse. It says I'm in the good GPS coverage area and then it starts measuring activity after 5-7 min or so (or after 1-1.5km). There are some days when it's better, but generally it's really sad. The same goes for notting down running 10 km, but not taking account that you also ran 5 km to achieve that.",
            "Overall I enjoy the features, especially having the audio voice at intervals to tell me how far and fast I'm going. However, fairly often the voice will cut off or give me an incorrect measurement. For example, if I'm going faster than the set pace itll say I'm behind my pace. Same for the opposite, if I'm going slower than the set pace, it'll tell me I'm faster..",
            "I have been using this app for 7Y now (4y paid) to track my runs. Last year I switched to a paid membership w/Strava and came back to RunKeeper not too long ago. There has been no change to this app. I've stopped using it to track during my runs because gps is way off so I rely on my Garmin watch. This means I don't get any of the voice features which I used to love. It's also very frustrating that I can't link a run to training plan after its completed. You're seriously sending me to desktop?!",
            "As with many of the reviews on here, I would have to agree that the quality of this app has decreased greatly over the last year or so. It very rarely will even log an entire workout without the app crashing. I use one of the newest phones on the market so there should be no issue. I've attempted to reinstall hoping that that would resolve the crashing issues but that has not been successful.",
            "I have used Runkeeper over 7 years with 4-5 Star results. This year it became difficult to work with. Workouts just stopped recording for or the GPS would drop out and just leave me a straight line. Efforts to edit these workouts no longer worked on my Windows 10 PC so I tried my wife's MacBook and I couldn't edit on it either. I researched solutions online and tried everything suggested none of it worked. I contacted customer support. The reply was: its not a priority for us at this time."

            "The game is good, but while youre in the game the car feels weightless specially in multiplayer mode. Once you've been hit by another car, you'll just fly into the air like the car has no weight at all. Plus, if you drift in corners and you are hit by other car you will loose your grip and driftline. I don't know if you guys, the developer is playing jokes on making a drift game on mobile to earn money. Learn to make a good game first before selling us anything. For now, fix it!",
            "This game is a lot of fun, the controls are smooth and it's not gimmicky, the cars function like normal, like if you go to fast into a corner you will understeer and the hand break isn't a \"push to drift button\" like other games, I hope the dev is working on more content cause this game is so much fun. My only complaint is that the game is quite grindy with all the different things you have to do to get all the stars each race.",
            "This game so far has impressed me very much. Not Forza graphics, but they are amazing for a 121 Mb game. There are 15 cars you can buy! (In game or cheap purchases with real money) I think there are 3 or 4 maps. (For single Player) So you do a practice run, and then you race with AI. For multiplayer, you need to collect 20 stars, which will take you about 10-20min to unlock. It is very fun. You can get upgrades with your money, buy new cars, get paint jobs and more. In game you can get boost 2x",
            "Almost perfect rally game. If possible I would rate more than 5 stars. Really good controls and graphics. Only in future updates I would like to see more realistic damage on the cars. And maybe another track - a city track for instance. Overall this is the best rally game I played from play-store. Keep on developing this game please!",
            "Love new track in canyon. But new update had bug. I know don't just for me or other else had this problem, the handbrake can't engage when where necessary. They didn't work so well when we still on acceletor and want to using handbrake or brakes. It's need to tap twice also cause lag of reaction make me crash. Old version perform this thing so well. Maybe you guys can fixed this. Btw, still excellent game ever"

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

But I changed the file name long before i install this app. Is this the reason why these files playback don't work ?",

In addition the developer offers an extended free trial for the pro version to evaluate the app thoroughly, although it is perfectly usable in the free version, but the cost of the pro version is almost a give away price!

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

This app only works once in a blue moon on the 13th day of every other month.",

If it's possible, I can't find it. :( Edit: I deleted the app. It kept freezing up, there was no intuitive way to adjust the font style or size, & it would sometimes just go dark.

            "Typical google chaotic mess... Google dumps apps, replacement to come at some point in the future... Don't hold your breath! Buy an app on your phone... Can't install the companion on your watch as the play store won't allow repurchase and gives no option to just install... Am at the point where I hope google does get split up by the US senate... Maybe then we will get some competition and decent freaking applications with support!! Google currently SUCKS!",
            "I have tried to connect my Oppo watch. Application freezes at 8-10% I have tried previous versions, nothing... Tried other devices the same... Disappointing. Now I must wait for Google to fix this so I can use my smartwatch.... Till then I can admire it in its box. I was a huge fan of wear os... From now on.... NEVER AGAIN :) :)",
            "Functional but I do feel it's gone backwards. I don't even have the option to show battery levels now. Must be something wrong in the licensing agreements as less and less people despite this being the future of tech seem to be using. Mobile and search being Googles main stay. Feels the same for Home platforms. I'm a Google fan but watch out for the monster that ate blackberry",
            "I recently updated this app, and none of my notifications pop up anymore! They don't even notify me until I have to open up my phone again, is there anyway possible ya'll can fix this?",
            "Ever since I update the application, I can't even receive any notifications (whatsapp, IG, Facebook, email etc). I have tried restarting my Oppo Watch four times and and my phone three times but to no avail. I don't want to do a factory reset my watch since I dont want to lose my data and especially since I can't guarantee it will works as usual. And please dont tell me to inform this on your Wear Os Community because I did emailed to you yesterday and I haven't receive any feedback from you."

Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",

Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",

The file list should scroll as files are copied/moved so you can see where you are in the process. 2. Much more importantly, the timestamps on the copied/moved files *should be the same as the original files*. Having 200 gb of files with the current date and time is useless. I will now have to do the entire thing again using a different utility. The app is useless until this is corrected.",
            "My first attempt to copy a video worked, so went ahead and moved a bunch of pics using this app. All files are on the USB but are unable to open on any device stating \"unsupported file type\" and I can't find how to fix so my pics are lost. Awful experience, I'll be seeking a refund 👎👎👎",
            "I would not recommend this app at this time, because I can't use it. I have to: grant the SD card (which is SanDisk card) access to the SanDisk Memory Zone app in order to complete the operation. The directions that come with the app are incomplete at best. So far using this app has been a waste of time. I can't transfer anything at this point. I've tried contacting you once before & I'm still waiting for an answer or acknowledgment. The SD card I have on my phone now is the SanDisk Ultra Plus microSDXC UHS-I card with Adapter 64GB. The small card is the one I can use on my phone.",
            "I loooove the App.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can't get my songs to play one after the other. If you could make that happen I would give 10 stars.

        "comments": [
            "Overall, I really enjoy the app but its not without its flaws. I understand that you need premium to remove the watermark but it does not need to be that freakin' large on the screen. Also there should be more variety with the text and effects; the options are good but not really enough. The positives with PowerDirector are unlike these other video editing apps, this has always been easy to use and the options aren't confusing to figure out. I'd recommend this app for starter youtubers!",
            "I used to rate this app with 5 stars, but just before I wrote this review, I was editing a video, and I found a lot of bugs, but the one with most impact is that it usually stops the video for a while between transitions, and that's really annoying because it would make a delay between the main video and the voiceover. Please fix this bug, it didn't use to be like this.",
            "FACT: There is no better video editing app out there for mobile platforms. It's fast, has tons of options and is considerate of phone resource usage. I edit all my YouTube channel videos with it. To see what can a small example of what can be done, check out some of the more recent videos on my channel \"WalkingtheSabbathTalk\". All videos edited with this mobile app.",
            "Update: when they updated this app it now fails to play back any edited video you may be working on . Audio and video is out of sync and very choppy. Impossible to use. Needs to be fixed or I will finish off my three-month subscription and go elsewhere. I do love the editor but the problem I'm having is that my MP4 video files are not being accepted. Some are and some aren't. That for me is the deal breaker. I'm not going to pay a subscription anymore if I have troubles with it.",
            "Broken from last update. App crashes constantly. I can't edit anything. The moment I try, the app closes. (Even trying to change my subscription, I get a spinning wheel of death.) I have a new phone with plenty of storage and memory. This was pretty user friendly before. Now it's completely unusable. And a waste of money. Edit in response: Of course I tried restarting it. I also restarted my phone multiple times. This app made my phone heat up to a dangerous degree. I'll revisit if fixed."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

Now including seahorses and turtles!\r\n\r\nWhether it be a newborn baby, infant, or child. This sensory play activity is guaranteed to provide them with joy and entertainment! Ideal for when you’re out and about and your infant is getting bored or upset, when your toddler won’t settle and getting up to mischief or when you just want to relax your kids before bed time – distract and get their attention with some visual stimulation in a joyful way!\r\n\r\nThis sensorial app has many unique features in comparison with other sensory based games, such as the firework, bubble, balloon pop and finger paint games available. Choose to amuse your baby with this visually stimulating, interactive, sensory game.\r\n\r\nNot only will this sensory app delight your kids, it will also provide increased educational benefits. From the early stages of your babies development, they are constantly learning and absorbing information around them, they begin to see, touch, feel, hear and understand how their interactions are affecting the environment around them. Your baby will begin to learn that touching the screen will cause bubbles to be created. Your child can drag your finger across the screen to create a pattern of bubbles. Your newborn can place their hands on the screen to cause lots of bubbles to be created at all points on the screen that they are touching. \r\n\r\nWith sensory fish, your child will experience and educate themselves by use of the cause and effect techniques and features implemented. As your baby touches the screen, they gain instant feedback of a vibration, sound effects and bubbles. They will eventually begin to understand that their touch is also causing the fish to swim towards where they touched. If they were to touch the screen in multiple position, the fish will swim between all of those touched positions! Your baby learns and adapts to their findings within the game. \r\n\r\nAs the game is fairly simple to understand and not too complex, it is ideal for young kids, boys and girls of ages from 0 months (with a parent showing them the game), up to the late kindergarten / preschool stage of their development where they fully understand and can control all aspects of the world and have learned exactly what the cause will be from their actions.\r\n\r\nSensory game play is great for the continued development of your kids motor skills and hand eye coordination development. It aids in helping to fine tune the motoric skills and movements, the very detailed movements that we require and use every day.\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown to have great benefits in learning and stimulation for children with autism and children with special educational needs (SEN). Having already received excellent feedback from parents who have children with autism, special educational needs (SEN) and learning disabilities. \r\n\r\nInstall now! It’s convenient, educational, stimulating, fun and best of all, it’s free!",

I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "I really liked the free version, so I paid to support the author... worth it. There's a variety of puzzles available, and the order to complete them is customizable (mine's set to random). Tasks include math, memory, matching, typing and more, all with different levels of difficulty to choose from (except 1 where the phone needs to be shaken). The volume/ brightness can be set to increase over time. I can also have another app start when finished.",
            "The best app I've ever found for multiple alarms & can use my own mp3 sounds. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a reliable alarm app & can use your own stuff with it. Never have used the problem solving bit, nothing too complex before coffee. I guess you can make it as simple or complex as you like , either way it's a really cool app.",
            "The alarm randomly experiences an error and doesn't go off until I manually open the app. This persists even after a factory data reset. I've used this app for 6 year and never had a problem until recently, and now I've missed my classes 3 times and have to get out all my old alarm clocks again because I can no longer trust the app to do its job.",
            "Love this alarm clock app! 100% success rate in getting me out of bed so far (better than anything else I've tried up to this point). I do wish there was some more variety in the tasks, though. It does get a bit boring repeating the same things every morning (and I do have it set up for a random variety of 5 different tasks every morning, but it gets repetitive fast). This alarm app works great, but consider adding even more tasks types (and providing more variety within the current task types)."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "I really enjoyed this app it's actually really cool! Now that it was Holloween I tried it... Yes it is neat. The only issue is that you can use the app just to see if you like it and it will give you a lot of options but I didn't like that if you didn't purchase this app... You get cut off and you cut off your potential customers to early I understand that you're goal is to make money off your app.Im not sure about the purchase I don't know what more it has to offer just get cut off .",
            "When signing up for monthly pro, the app tells you your first 3 days are free and \"at the end of the 3 day trial period an auto-renewable subscription will be activated automatically.\" This is a lie! There is no free trial; you will be charged immediately! Luckily I disputed the charges with Google and got my money back, but beware y'all, there is no free trial, regardless of what my screenshot of the app clearly says.",
            "This is an awesome app! There are two paid option that are reasonable and so worth it. With so many cool options and features that are available to try for free you will definitely stay busy and will want to the paid version and the more you share the smarter the app gets so you can't go wrong. I Definitely recommend this app.",
            "Luv 💗. I use this app all the time. I love it. The only thing id say it needs to improve on is the fact that there are not many options that work for group photos. Most onky work for selfies",
            "I dropped off the one star and reduced it to zero. The devs responded about getting the 1 year option and everything was wrong. Here's what you have to do: cancel your subscription and wait for a little bit. You will then have MANY places where they nag you to go PRO and from there you can choose either subscription option. You cannot do like the dev said. This is sure a lot more trouble than it's worth. UNINSTALLED! ---ORIGINAL review: I'm giving this ONE star because of their business model. Like other's, the first thing I saw was an offer of 3 day free trial with $4.99 PER MONTH after, plus another offer (that I can no longer find) for $9.99 per year. I might go for the yearly option except for the fact that everything they do seems shady. There are NO options and that includes no way within the app to tell it not to send notifications. I immediately was targeted with a notification and after a few of those, I had to go into the phone's notification settings to block them. They constantly nag me to share my pictures on their web site so they can have free use of my creations which they make it VERY difficult to remove what you shared and changed your mind. The online website provides NO options to delete your shares. Somewhere, I saw a recommendation for this app but it didn't give a clue about how expensive it was (even on the App Store, there is little to warn you). You find this out right away when you first run it. Positive note: the app itself is very fun and very addictive. It's all internet based functions, very little is actually on the phone taking up your memory. If you have weak internet or poor signal, this will be frustrating slow. If I can't find the overpriced $9.99 per year option, I'm not continuing this grossly overpriced monthly subscription. It's fun, but not THAT fun. With the lack of information and options, I am suspect of this company's motives. There is so much wrong with this company and it's functions it's kind of scary."

            "This app works great. But after each update it gets messed up for a short while. The last time you gutpys updated two of my cameras stopped working on the app. but after two weeks or so they started working again. But now after the update on the 16th two of my cameras stopped working again. What's going on?",
            "Poor experience in fast forward condition first you need to buy package than you can allow to use fast forward and that also not that great which you paid for cloud package Please put fast forward specifications in SD card also because without this specification no use to find person as soon as possible..... Otherwise this app and product (camera) is to easy to use",
            "Im using network segment15(255.254.0.0) instead of 24,thats why even if we were in the same network with the same gateway, theres always a connecting issue. It would be better if this supports LAN storage as it is more secured and lower cost....I hope theres an update with facial recognition or maybe an update with 3D camera. Unstable playing over LAN when connected to wifi. Do you have a cam version with ethernet port capability? I think it would be better when playing livestream and replay....",
            "This camera works well. Very good clear picture, and has different ways the camera will connect. Alarm and voice works well. In the settings you can turn off voice, and disarm alarm, which are nice features. 4 stars because it needs an option for split screen view, at the top on right side by the X like most apps maybe in the future though . So far this is a good security camera with lighting as well.",
            "Application will not start at all after the update. Only white screen EDIT: I managed to start application by completely removing it and installing it again. Then I got notified to update camera firmware. I did. Camera said that update was finished and it seams that everything went fine (internet and power were stable). Now I cannot connect to camera at all. In application it says \"connecting\" forever on the panel where video should be shown."

        "description": "Speak Up: An SPL Meter is designed for people that need training modulating or increasing their speaking volume; this can include children with cognitive impairment or children that have a hard time understanding the concept of loudness. Because of the app's flexible nature, there is also a setting to make the app appropriate for adult users, like those with Parkinson's disease.\r\n\r\nThis tool can be used in Speech Pathology therapy sessions in place of a standard sound pressure level (SPL) meter to offer visually appealing feedback, or to continue training at home. The app works by monitoring your voice using the device's built in microphone. As you speak, the app converts your voice into a decibel measurement, which in turn then controls an image within the app. This image moves vertically higher as you speak more loudly and lower as you speak more softly. The goal is to keep the image within the \"Great\" (green) color zone. Users can adjust the ranges of the color zones on a \"Level Input\" screen. This screen allows you to enter decibel ranges for the color zones. This allows the user more flexibility during a training session and also allows the app to be used for a variety of speech conditions.\r\n\r\nCalibration with a sound pressure level (SPL) meter is not required for everyday use, but might be desired for use in a therapy setting. Do this by using the calibration offset features in the Settings menu (see training guide) until the decibel output in the app matches that of the SPL meter.\r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\n\r\n- Kid and adult friendly\r\n- Animated background to give the feel of a bee moving through scenery\r\n- Accurate decibel measurements & visible output\r\n- Ability to adapt app to meet user needs by changing images and decibel ranges for the color zones\r\n- Two fun backgrounds available\r\n- Calibration features to ensure exact measurements (not required for everyday use, but may be desired for clinical use)\r\n- Logging capabilities so you will know how you are progressing\r\n- Detailed training material included\r\n\r\nThe development of this app was supported by the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center for Community Living, Health and Function (LiveWell RERC) funded by a grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) in the United States Department of Health and Human Services (grant no. 90RE5023).",

            "I am an SLP and this app is great visual feedback for loudness for my clients with low vocal intensity. What would really make this app amazing and useful for me everday is if you were 1) able to set a GOAL mark for loudness (such as 65 db) and 2) if it tracked average db over the course of a phrase, sentence, or timed interval.",
            "Does not work just constant 10 db. Yup, I'm experienced and it just flails inline with any adjustments, it's just a novelty item.",
            "this is really useful, any chance you can do an app for my galaxy smartwatch??",
            "I am a SLP and think this is a creative way to measure and track vocal intensity during therapy. Kids will find the bee character interesting and motivating.  For adults, it will be helpful to visualize your target vocal intensity.  Loudness is not tangible so it is hard to know when you are meeting your target. Patients and therapists could use this app for the entire session to determine if they are on track. Helpful for many different patient populations.",
            "What a great idea! Increasing (or decreasing) loudness can be a difficult goal to track and this app provides not only the SLP more tangible/reliable data collection but also provides the patient a chance to improve overall awareness and self-monitor their loudness level. This app is user friendly and can be used with both pediatric and adult populations."

            "This freezes so often and the rewards, loots obtained in the battles are so less that it takes a lot longer to buy equipments. Plus the wait time for upgrading the tanks and its accessories is very long. The tanks are over-rated, thus, exorbitant. If there was any option of minus rating, I would rate it minus 10. The game developers should either improve it to meet the demands of its subscribers or the google play should completely ban boring games like this one.",
            "Fun game, however the only way to really advance is to buy the premium. At 8 bucks a week, get real. Same for buying packages, they want to get rich overnight. Need to learn that a million one dollar bills still makes a million dollars. Also, you don't always get credited with a kill. Needs to also be a way to communicate with others during battles. Enjoyed playing, but moving on.",
            "This was a great game for years, but with each upgrade it slowly got worse. Now it's a piggy bank for the privalaged.when it actually works. Whatever it gives you free , it takes from you in equal measure.the minute it crashes or freezes, I'm sorry but your game is unplayable. So if your a new player don't waste your time and effort. Because even if you pay to play it rarely works. They're not so quick to put the problem right for you,",
            "Decent battle game, but Devs need to improve battle matching. Many times the game matches you up with player ranks & tanks 2 sometimes 3 tiers above you -- difficult to compete with that. Also, the game has frequent sever/ connection issues as others have stated. The game selects the server automatically and does not show the option to change if it thinks one is better than another (should alow user to choose).",
            "While I enjoy the game play... I'm completely put off by the constant disconnect. Daily. Multiple times daily. Many times it just locks up and I have to quit the game. Guess what though... it still logs that you used energy to attempt your match. So, you lose that time. That's kind of a big deal for a game that uses three energy an entry. I've tried my home network and I have had the same disconnect issues as my mobile network."

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",

            "Changing my review to 5 stars. I had some issues that were addressed. Which I really appreciate!! This is really a fun game!! I wish the freezing bug could be fixed. But they definately care about their customers who play their game!! Thank You!! Just had a suggestion for the weekly event that cost gems to race. The rewards are xp gas and tickets. Why not offer gems for first place winners. I use hundreds of gems in the event. You could offer the gems instead of the tickets. Just my 2 cents.",
            "I love this game! My favorite part about this app is that it always lagging the game to make you crash so then you have to buy more gems! Along with the continuous ads is really perfect for the game! This is definally the best game to spend your money on! Update: Fastlane you can stop making this a pay to win game! That is my suggestion!",
            "loving it also i started getting videos again about 75 percent of them gave me rewards a few of them timed out but im not complaining rewards are great no matter what. Ive bought all drones and have a lot of gold tickets built up with no use. Would like to see some kind of gold exchange for them that would be great.",
            "Very fun, very challenging, fast paced, strengthens hand eye coordination, upgrade prices are reasonable, obtaining resources you need is easy but not too easy, good graphics, good music. Overall a great game"

            "Its really nice because it challenges you to build it better and better. The only 2 problems i have encountered with this game is that it goes from easy to super hard too fast! There should be more intermediate levels and slowly introducing inclines, jumps, obstacles and free standing bridges. The camera angle, OMG! This is such a headache. If you want to see where the stress is at, you have yo change it to 2D which is almost 8bit MarioBros 1 style! Its ridiculous! Still great tho!",
            "too many ads,a game that is literally pay to win,ripoff of polybridge,honestly this game is just the poopy mobile version for polybridge,and stolen textures,those who left five stars either 1:never heard of polybridge2:think this games better because it is free and not all people can install polybridge,and i heard one person talking about how polybridge is a ripoff of this and they said \"polybridge was made:2018 and this game was made: 2017 so dont believe that dont Confuse this for polybridge",
            "The developer of this game does not respect your time. This might be the first time in like 10 years Ive written a review complaining about ads but this is ridiculous. Random 30 second ads when you lose, when you win, when you start a level, and literally being forced to watch ads to get enough \"coins\" to unlock a level.. & its legit 2 and a half minutes of ads to unlock the level. Its pure greed, its outrageous and ruins the game. It's fun tho if you dont mind watching ads more than playing it",
            "I think I downloaded the Screen Saver version, because apparently, when I open the app, it NEVER gets to the main menu, or not even a loading screen. It just shows 2 islands, a \"Build a Bridge\" logo on the bottom left corner with some clouds passing by in the sky. I kept my phone on, charging, for the next few hours to see what would happen, and nothing. Still a screen saver. Tried uninstalling, formatting, restarting, but nothing.",
            "I really like this game but since I'm young I don't have money and can't get the extra worlds and I beat this game fast. I ran out of levels to play because of the expense of the extra levels so can you possibly replace the payment with ads or make us beat each world to move on to the next one? Thanks in advance!"

Nobody gets to manipulate me! every time I search I get exactly what I'm looking for and even more articles than Google would have ever provided! The best part is it's private! Nobody's sharing my information! Tell your friends take control of your life!!",
            "I've been using this for quite awhile now & have made it my default browser. I love the privacy aspect- especially now that we're in the middle of the election. I don't get the SPAM emails that I do if I use the typical Android browsers. DDG has all of the functionality that other browsers do but the best one is being able to delete my browsing data without a trace, & it auto blocks cookies( which media & shopping sites don't like, but I think it's great.) It's also very user friendly.",
            "I've been using this browser for 1 1/2 years with no problems until 2 weeks ago. When I tried to login to a site I use regularly I got a message saying it doesn't support Safari 4 and I keep getting this message since then. I could use chrome, but I don't want to. I sent 2 emails to the developers last week. They haven't replied. Disappointing! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Didn't solve the problem. If I had gotten a reply from technical support I would have rated it a 5.",
            "All it really needs is a built in ad blocker and it would be the best private browser you'll ever really find. Its speed makes it an amazing \"default\" browser for quick use, and the ability for it to automatically erase your data after a period of inactivity is priceless! But until it can block ads, I still have to primarily use other browsers for YouTube and leisure browsing. Without that important function (which is a basic standard today), it still falls under a very niche browser.",
            "Wowser Browser! DDG allows me options that none of the others do. For example, it allows copy & paste a host of things with ease much like Chrome without the peeking over your shoulder cookie monsters. It isn't such a hassle to save your favorite/ most visited sites. Sounds simple enough. But to my frustration with the exception of a few browsers, you have to literally manually save a site that you just want the browser to open up to automatically. I love DDG!"

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

Free stuff daily don't have to spend real money to advance. Keep up the good work developers!!!! Best fishing game on android. 5 stars across the board!!!",
            "Really love the game, however like most app games you have to pay to get anywhere. New Halloween event? Pay for a pass to get better prizes. New challenges, pretty nice, if they didn't run entire days of legendary fish that most people don't have. I'm sure there are more casual players that enjoy the game, that wouldn't mind being rewarded. Just a thought. Recommend for wasting time. Progressing or competing, not so much.",
            "this game was fun at first, but it is just a money pit now. The events are only attainable by those with fat wallets. And when the game goes down for more than a day, they give you a booby prize as compensation. Won't be spending any more money or time on it. My advice is don't play unless you're rich and famous IRL",
            "Was brilliant. Have spent over £100 on this game. It's a fix!! You will constantly keep spending money. You'll never have what is needed until you spend, spend and spend more. It lags, freezes and you lose items you have paid for for this. I have contacted them and nothing!! Or they state nothing is wrong. Completely disgusting. What a waste of money!!",
            "I was on level 59 entering 60! Played two months & was winning big, smooth clan, and BAM! Game Updated & started me completely over! Customer support wasn't available to help me get back where I was. Im not starting over at level 1 again. I put too much time n effort into this game. I was logged into Facebook account and Google! It didn't save my process! So I'm deleting the game! Good luck new players. It will happen to you. I was starting the Halloween theme! It really socks! No game 😕"

            "It has stopped working properly. If you are exercising outdoors and it has stopped working, even the steps stop being recorded. Imagine hiking for an hour and it has recorded the first 4 minutes with 130 steps, that's all you will have as steps taken. If you delete that activity, then even those steps are gone. The map in the background has no details as well and it's a mess when you are in an unfamiliar area.",
            "I can't sign up or log in to the app. I tried to follow the steps to send a technical message to the app but there isn't anything at the \"bottom right hand of the\" Explore\" for me to click. It is as if there are many people developing the app and nobody knows what is going on.",
            "It's a good app. The only sticking point is the stepcoubter is too sensitive. I had 110 steps this morning before I even got out of bed. But it has a lot if other features, like posting and comment threads and challenges, so I use it in tandem with my other pedometer.",

I have to check the calendar at best to find tasks, at worst I have to refer to the email I was sent. Making the app effectively useless. I can just use a calendar app. That way I can see the info i need at a glance without having to dig for it. UPDATE. I don't see ANY of my projects at all in the app. Just deleted the app. Thanks!!",
            "Lot of issues of login. Very stupid idea login by email. You cannot login into your asana account without using the \"magic email\". There is no option to enter in your password and email combination. Since my email accounts are both Gmail I'd be obliged to logout and login back in each time or create a new account and lose my work. Is it really asking too ...",

            "The game is a good game, dont get me wrong. But there are 3 big things that are issues for me. One, is that the game is very complicated. There is so much stuff when you open the menu, I feel it would be better even if it was a little more \"basic\". Also, there are lots of ads, which I mean the game has to make money. Lastly, it needs a strong internet connection to play, and I feel an offline mode would be nice.",
            "I have been playing this game for over 3 years and I was just starting to get somewhere with a purchased rod and reel. The posiden rod 5 stars stats were rather good then with a successful evolution to a 6 star rod it gives me garbage stats I would expect from a 3 star rod and no way to go back to my previous rod. The stats on evolution should be a comparison or better of the 2 rods your using to improve the one you already have. Not the garbage it gave me. You could answer your emails.",
            "Really cool option to play as if your phone is an actual fishing pole W/ phones gyro. You progress quickly & are given enough free loot to start and keep the game going as you progress to earn higher level equipment and achievements. Graphics are great, controls are very easy and straight forward. Also very accurate in the depiction of the different types of fish that you would actually catch. Game accurately depicts the fish that are indigenous to the areas you fish in the game. Overall GREAT!!",
            "If you cant play for a while you will lose your guild and all the money and hard work you put in will be give to someone on your team and they wont talk and don't fish much this suck by far thus the 1 star rating a bot in control of my guild you email for help and they tell you its nothing they can do you have to w8 till person misses 20 days or more im pissed as all hell because I worked at the hospital when rona popped up and had to work doubles i had no time to check in. I want all my $ back",
            "It should have higher quality graphics setting. Good game, but the graphics is still stuck in 2014. It doesn't look good on a FHD screen."

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

            "I do know that you need to keep up on the ads in order to earn some money whilst providing us this browser but it's really annoying espeacially upon getting ads after ads. This is a nice browser and all but I hate to admit that this doesn't really do well about it's ad management. I do know that I could the thing but I'm still reconsidering if it's actually a good browser or not.",
            "After the latest update I can't export any media files to my device even though it says \"exported successfully\" but when I go to check the folder, nothing exported. Please fix ASAP. I really do like this app very much but something's buggy with the latest update. I have a pixel 4a if that helps. I will edit rating if it gets fixed. Update Oct. 6, 2020 I can now successfully export videos from app to device but not in the Life folder it exports to my Movies folder. Still cannot export pictures",
            "BEWARE. This browser is a fraudulent click bait and most reviews are paid. The browser doesn't work free because as it forces you to buy premium. If you try to close (X) the box somehow, it won't close. Forces with pop-ups to download and buy VPN hub and b this browser to use it. REPORTED. Please report the browser as I have mailed to Google play store safety team. Also it promotes adult & vulgar ads. If browser wants to do business then it should be ethical and start by freemium not force them.",
            "The developers ruined this app. This app was great at first and then like every other apps that gets an update, things turned messy. Too many bug and error encountered. Download wont resume unless you regularly click the \"download tab\" and go back and click again. Exporting downloaded media files are full of errors. Sad but true",
            "Used to be the best until the last update now u can't download any video anymore, i think the developers either deliberately ruined their app facing being sued by google or other apps for piracy or these company develop a new counter piracy software in which they have no solution for it until now, at least on the bright side they still let you keep your old videos."

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

            "I really like this editing app. It has lots of features and I have found it mostly easy to use. I have used other editing apps but always come back to this one. It would be a great feature in this app to be able to save, search, or favorite certain presets... like the preset texts. Overall, Great App. Good job. Plus, thanks for all the cool things available with this app for free.",
            "This app is really easy to use, and has a lot of options to choose from when editing photos from various filters, to effects. There are so many things to do with this app, even with the free version. The only issue I have is sometimes a picture will become pixelated however majority of the time, the outcome is great. Definitely my favorite photo editing app",
            "You can do alot of customisation and there are presets available for free which are enough to get you going, you can make realy nice edits with what's there you just need to get creative with it. and there aren't any ad pop-ups, insted they're on the side of your editor and don't get in the way of anything which is great. But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",
            "App keeps crashing I have been using this app for a long time now, have had problems in the past but now it keeps crashing as soon as it's opens. So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still keeps in crashing. I have purchased a LOT of effects, so I really need this to work. I gave 1 star because of this problem, if you can get this working for me I will upgrade the rating.",
            "Bestest ever... Amazing app with ennumber of filters & effects. I've been using it for 3 years now and I love it! my all time favorite app. Easy to use and very impressive and the great part is that its almost add free. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

One of the warnings that came up when I force stopped the app was something about affecting other apps. Hey, here's an idea --- list the apps that are affected by it. Wow. What a concept! No option to uninstall.",
            "The app has made YouTube VR app dysfunctional for those who have a headset that doesn't have a button. Can't even see what features the update brought because the app won't even let you in without having a button on the headset (or a magnet) through which it can detect if the headset has been put on."

It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying.

            "This game is the best there ever was. It has a lot of cars and also cool graphics. the graphics are even better than some gta games. and the crashings are maaaaaddddd!!!. Because when a car crash you can finish the race with your crashed car. It has many tracks and you can travel to other cities. The game is goooood!!! I need to see the \"lynkan hypersport\" in this game that is my favourite car",
            "I am only 12 and I wasn't really that much of a 12 year old kid that really liked to play games until I downloaded it and it is so fun you get to customize your vehicle like the engine, tires, paint, and other things. And the derbys are so fun to play you can have up to 11 or 12 cars with you in the derby. And the best part is it is offline. One last thing could you add a 1970 dodge charger with the engine sticking out of the hood please.",
            "This is a awesome game! Really love this game. I gave this game 5 stars! Because the controls is alright, the gameplay is awesome and the graphics is very good... What I love is that, this is not just a demolition derby, you can do racing as well! That makes it more fun to play and addictive. Keeps me busy and I enjoy this game alot! Would give it 6 stars if I could ;-) I would love to see my favourite car 1969 Volkswagen Beetle!",
            "It's a good game and everyone should get it. I like the game it's a fun game to play I have made five or six cars completely upgraded and they are really cool cars and I rely won't to now what car is under the torp I bet it a good car 🚗. I always make my car red whith red wendos and white flams it's rely cool . They also have red and white tiyers.",
            "This game is really fun but the down side is that it gives u a little bit of ads when u finish the racing on but over all it is really fun. Their is so many cars that u can buy and wheels so many things that u need to check out but I really wish their was a monster truck in the game it would be so much better."

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there's a song on there that I really like using but every time I do, and I put the credit down exactly as they have it, I get a copywrite strike on the video I'm trying to upload and I have to go back into InShot and cut that song and replace it. It's quite inconvenient. Please fix this! I love that song!! Love Love Love by Fox in Oil.",
            "Hi! I really enjoy this app so much i always use it! But it's missing a few features that i would recommend would make the app better! Chrome key, key frames, overlay, More filters and stickers (non premium), more animations for text and transition. I think that will make InShot more better! If you're reading this please make it happen!",
            "Love this app but one thing that I hate is when you are saving a video and then you go to your gallery and delete the selected one and then If you will go back to inshot it will show you that info code 2 not that video but anyways it's a good app I will give it 5 stars .",
            "Super amazing editing app it had everything it's the best editor app I have ever used it's almost perfect! But it needs to be able to add gifs in storage and also a chroma key and also we should be able to make it horizontal and can zoom in after that It's the most perfect editing app!",
            "After practicing with new features, I found it very helpful and easy for video editing on smart phone device. The app provided good instructions and the developers actively update the app. Thanks. I decided to buy app since you guys deserve it for the quality given."

            "This game, Grand Action Simulator is actually very good and enjoyable to me. I had played this game before. There is problem with this game, it get hanged while playing. If they can fix this problem and if they add more places, weapons and cars. I will give 3 stars. Thank you.",
            "I love this game very much. But I need a game where there is more than 20 countries. There will 1 airport on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One country to another country. (Suppose that I will go from Japan to USA then I will need to buy ticket, like $1100). There will minimum 3/4 railway stations on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One area to another area . (Suppose that I will go from New York to another one then I will need to buy ticket, like $110)",
            "I liked this game so much but i want new job places like a bank,a post office, a office,a police station,etc.And why is not there any fire department,bus station,etc from where we can take the job.We shouldn't be able to take parked vehicles without its keys. There should more of job like buildings which we can go inside to take keys of the vehicle(for rent) parked for the job.After any job is done we should only be able to get money by collecting it from its departmentbyparking itsvehicle back",
            "I rate five stars not because it's a generally good game, but because it's very janky and it's just perfect. But add more houses, a larger open world, and melee weapons. Thanks!",
            "I agree I would like to see more buildings, houses, and countries but overall I enjoy this game."

Sub tasks should show their parent in \"Next 7 Days\" and \"Today\", this would be super powerful for splitting a task over several days, it would be a game changer for me!",

Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
            "Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days.",
            "I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
            "Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again !"

            "Thanks Brothers, I love JW app 💗💗💗 However, recently I am experiencing an issue with it and I am wondering if you would be able to help me please. It's interfering with all my other personal and business files even my voice recording files. The app is taking over opening them up by its self. Even through I have not chosen to open a file up with JW app. I have to continually uninstall JW app if I want to open up any of my personal files. Maybe its a setting I haven't worked out yet 🤗💖",
            "Great App. But I would recommend some upgrades. When I search for a word (eg. Sun) in the Bible and see the results, only the beginning of all verses will appear in searching results and in most cases the word I am searching for, will not appear. So I have to open that verse to find the word, eg. in the Pslams. And when I go back to the searching results, after reading that verse from Pslams, I can't preceed where I left, but all verses from Genesis to Revelation will appear again.",
            "This app is awesome. Its contents are numerous and interesting still it's very easy to use. But, occasionally, after downloading certain videos at night, the platform sends a message that the videos are not available. I think it would be better for the platform to prevent me from downloading the videos when the videos are not available, instead of allowing me to download it after which it sends a message that the videos aren't available.",
            "Extremely user friendly and all videos well made simplistic teaching tools. I love how easy it is for me to share so many different books, music, videos and articles with others via email and text messaging. And the convenience made available through this app to enhance bible study and research is so valuable. Thank you!",
            "This app is amazing ,so efficient in accessing spiritual food .But I think it would have been much better if it had a 'search' option right away from the home page where one can search publications or articles that are far deep into different categories."

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

            "I get sick of trying to explain this to game manufacturers, but 30 sec ads are a thing of the past. All you get is people uninstalling your game and complaining about the ads. Now a game with 5 or 10 second ads will get played and you will subject the player to a lot more ad time. How can you be smart enough to write a game but not be able to figure that out? Uninstalled.",
            "MORE ADS, LESS PLAY This is a pretty fun game but it's sadly riddles with ads. If you skip an ad for a reward, you're met with an ad anyways. That's cheap. Don't be cheap. I would love to see your company implement higher ethical standards when it comes to things like how often you subject your potential buying customers with ads. Right now it's about 10 seconds of game play VS. 120 seconds of ads. If you treat ppl better, they're more inclined to micro pay",
            "Pretty entertaining. However, the ads are excessive and what really irritated me was the coin math wasn't correct. If you watched an ad for a certain amount of coins, you did not receive that amount of coins. It was way less, sometimes a few thousand less. Something that basic shouldn't be wrong in a game. Very irritating.",
            "I wish I could give this a 3.5. Sounds are great, game play is fun, coins are useful and there's always a fun little \"3x coins! Watch this ad!\" Ads aren't a huge issue since you can turn your wifi and data off. I believe more detail on uniqueness should've been done, and more add-ons like bombs, or something that you get further on other than skins that makes the game continually fun. All in all, game is a fun time waster :)",
            "I like the game, pretty nice here, you get more people, fight other armies and bosses. And that is it. But the reason I gave 3 stars, Because 2 reasons. 1: The ads here are terrible. You just keep getting ads everytime you complete a level. 2: There is this weird bug where when I go to next level, this black screen kinda looking things keeps appearing and disappearing on my screen, and whenever that happens, it ruins my advantage of winning. Please fix this annoying glitch, Devs."

All the sounds from the videos I gathered together can be heard over the music I chose and there's no option to stop this! This is very frustrating and I do hope this can be fixed, causee y'all could loose so much with this problem",

I'm having issues where I just can't make an edit because when I'm editing for a certain amount of minutes it just logs me off and makes me do everything again. I had everything done which took forever and then for some stupid reason it just made me restart AGAIN. ALL MY PROGRESS GONE. FIX YOUR APP NOW!",

            "It's always crashing, I never get to finish editing and exporting my videos. If I got the chance to, it's because I had to, in fear of it freezing. Usually even if I export, it's not ewhat I want. You guys should fix this cause it actually seems like a great app",
            "I could have chosen half star if I could. This app is so annoying, it's honestly cool when you create your photo videos and it has cool music's but why does it always when it's time to export.. it will just be in 0percent for hours. I've installed it many times but still same problem.. very annoying 😖😖😖"

            "Surprisingly great app considering its free. I have only tested the \"Full body\" and \"Lower body\" challenges so far and they are great. The only complaints are: - Not enough stretching at the beginning and end of the training. - The \"full body challenge\" essentially targets the upper body. Would have like a program for the whole body, 3-5 days a week! Good job guys (and girls)!",
            "Great in home workout! I have gotten a few new phones since using this though, and my progress doesn't come with me. For instance, I did the 30 day challenge a while back, but when I get a new phone the last parts of that circuit are locked unless I do it all again. That's my only knock. Been using this for a long time and really happy with the compressed, useful workouts.",
            "I used many apps but I have to admit that this is the best work out app. Can you imagine that I built a muscular body out of this app. No heavyweights needed, just a set of instructions and guidance to follow. The app is well designed, with work out plans, a section where you add your weight and calculate your BMI, and a full report given to you after every exercise. On top of this, there are no ads to bother you and you can even use it offline. In a nutshell, this is an awesome app!",
            "Voice guided, no intrusive ads, what more can I ask for? If you're not a beginner and know the \"theories\" of working out, this is useful. I seriously doubt the \"intermediate\" chest workout could be done perfectly by even an \"advanced\" person, as the rest intervals are waaaay too low.",
            "Tried doing the upper body and lower body routine 28 day challenge, and it was a great experience. The first 3 days all of my body was sore (haven't worked out in months). It targets certain parts of your body every day and gets more intense as days pass. Even has descriptions, gifs, and video examples in case there's confusion. I learned alot of different stretches and workouts to add to my own custom routine. And this was only 1 part of the app. Also the ads are so unintrusive!"

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

            "I am really grateful for Google services help. I stick when it comes to having a technological know how is irritating to me. This app has saved me and keeps me from crashing anymore computers, tablets especially I went through 41 mobile phones before this and now thanks to this Google services app I have had the same mobile phone for over a year and a half. Thank you Google.",
            "Horrible!! App will not connect with representative..shuts down every time. Google reps don't care. I have multiple issues with my Google account..no support other than email. Impossible to explain and ridiculous that this app is available but won't work and not one rep even questions why or tries to figure it out? Its a new Samsung S20 plus..it should work on my phone. I feel as if I've wasted a lot of money on a Google based phone that I have no direct support for...unacceptable.",
            "I see people on this app angry top. Had 5 month of hell with pixel 3a. The last week has been a replacement handset and now this one does not recongnise having a sim.. i feel sorry the peeps anwering the phones for google as they have have been hung out to dry. The one that called me the morning did not show as the usuall California number. It was his real name and location and phone number Got screenshots to prove it. Google can't even protect there own data lmao. Never mind us customers",
            "I'm still having trouble with my pixel 3A receiving text and sending text nobody seems to have an answer not even Google support I guess it's a spiritual thing",
            "Because after I installed the app it's say to uninstall and I call Google phone number and it sent me to this app and it's doesn't not work for me"

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

            "I have had this app since 2012 and it has been going down hill ever since. There are many bugs and glitches with the chat. The worst part for me is that the app is turning into an unmoderated conservative racist community. Posts that promote racism and fascism get featured daily and even the ads promote felonies... yes, felonies. Overall, this app is not funny, it is now just a hateful community with a political agenda.",
            "They took the shuffle option off featured. This limits the amount of time I actually use the app a day, considering I don't want to veiw the same pictures every time I open the app. 2/9/20 Not only have they not replaced the shuffle button, there's now an add that plays music, you can't click on it and it will CONTINUE to play music until you actually close the app. Not to mention, if you get push notifications, they show a feature out of the set. Most of the time its porn. Ridiculous. 10/18/20",
            "never use the app, the reason I'm reviewing is that when my friend would send me a link and text messages, it would open in chrome on my phone. this would be fine, but it obscures whatever meme or video there is, and says to have to continue. If you tap, it does not play the video, it brings you to the play store to install the app. I tried to work around it within chrome, but it does not seem to be possible. I consider this practice predatory as far as apps are concerned, and that is not okay.",
            "A majority of the features are just posted by bots. By blocking 10 accounts, I've successfully managed to avoid seeing well over half of the posts in the featured section. I've been here for years, and even the \"ifunny support\" bots weren't this annoying. If this keeps up, the app will find itself without a loyal userbase very, very quickly. DMs are broken now too, and keep bugging out weekly. The app is also growing increasingly laggy and slow.",
            "In the past I complained about the app crashing and horribly toxic community that consistently goes unmoderated. Not only are these still issues, but there are now more issues on top of this. The featured posts on the app are 9/10 times made by an account that is only a couple of days old. In my eyes, this means people are paying for their posts to be featured (which is the opposite of how they say the feature system works). I'd complain more, but I'm out of characters. Don't download. Waste."

            "Like everyone else. I used to love my Fitbit. I have a Charge 2. Since the last couple updates, it wont sync, doesn't record my activity or my sleep. It doesnt record that I hit my activity goal for the day. I am constantly restarting the fitbit and my phone to try to get it to sync. I liked it the way it was before. The new updates are horrible. I refuse to pay for premium. I will switch products if I have to.",
            "Doesn't sync a lot of time. Therefore it may be two days before shows you what your looking for. I have uninstalled and re installed to get it to do what is expected. Not. Alexa very seldom works so I gave up on that. Fitbit keeps pushing the \"Premuim\", why would I spend money for that when I cant even get basic to work. When it works it is great, and then I'm real happy. I have the Versa 2 fitbit.",
            "The app no longer automatically syncs with my watch. I have to force it to sync up multiple times a day and even then, it takes ages \"looking\" for my device which is always switched on and right next to the phone... I also don't get message or call notifications anymore. My device will be 2 years old in December, and I can tell you, I won't be bothering buying a new Fitbit product.",
            "10/18: AGAIN with the syncing issues. It's been 5 days and my watch and phone will not synch. This happens way too often. Please figure this out Fitbit! August 2020: Fitbit, As I can see I'm not the only one with synching and connecting issues. Whatever the problem is, fix it and fix it fast. We've paid a lot of money for a smartwatch with features that aren't working. I've tried all the tricks, disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth, restarting my phone, etc. and nothing is working.",
            "It no longer tracks my runs correctly. The map feature only shows a line for about 300 yards and then abruptly stops. The paces are also hilariously low. I'm flattered Fitbit thinks I can run as fast as it says I do. Ever since Fitbit was bought out, it's gone steeply downhill. Don't bother with them anymore. Update: now it's urging me to vote, which I truly don't understand, given it's a fitness app. You'd think they could spend some time fixing bugs such as the one described above instead..."

            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

You reinvented your app to look and do what every other photo edit app has already been doing. Problem is, your new design is just the base editing tool for countless apps. They offer much more than these basic settings. Very disappointed with the changes. Plus now there is an ad every 3-4 clicks now. This app is just the price of entry tool for most photo edit apps.",

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. 🙄",
            "After the latest updates seems they changed the format like where now you can't randomly choose a particular search area and for another instance you cannot unlike any of your ( likes) unless you're a paid member or unless only the person you had liked)pops up when you open the app,, then and only then you can choose to unlike the person or pay membership fee.."

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

Thanks for giving me some fun today!",

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

I bought both the 'Remove Ads' and the 'Unlock All leves and trains' item but the Ads were not removed and the trains and levels were still locked. Also, the purchases seem to be tied to a specific install, so you would get the ads and the trains and levels would be locked if you reinstall or switch device. Refunded, but please fix these issues and I will gladly buy them again.",
            "nice game and idea is great, but too easy and there are only 10 levels. +bugs. like in two levels it didn't fit the screen (8 and 9 as far as I remember). also sometimes if you playing driver-view it crushes. and one incovinience - after every level you're back in the garage, not on the level map, but you can play all game on one train."

            "So far the game is awesome but i cant go any further at a certain point. The girl and me stopped at a cliff face and she saw a cave and she's trying to lead me to it. she keeps on saying \"you're close\" and \"almost there\" and get closer\" but i cant move forwards. i turned right and she said to turn left so i did but i cant go straight. so i tried to turn left and she said to turn right. meaning that i AM facing her direction but it's not letting me move forward. The cave wind also keeps howling.",
            "Its a amaizing great game. I crossed all level. But last fight is not great. Its so easy. Although this game is number 1 game for blind people. Now i want a gbattle game related with gun like pub g game. Please try to make that game thank you entire team for such a interesting and great game",
            "Android 9. The game doesn't recognize any touches except douple taps. I couldnt change the language, couldn't move, couldn't go back to the menu. I was really excited to experience this audio game. Too bad.",
            "Its a really good game. I like the concept, an rpg game that the blind can play, brilliant. The audio is very nice, and it feels realistic. The only reason I took off a star is it takes a very long time to complete the directions the daughter gives. I spent a good 15-30 minutes just trying to get to a cave or forest. It honestly felt like I was going in circles. Second, it's very tricky. Which would be ok, but I died right away when I was following the instructions and was running away.",
            "Unique gameplay, you have to listen to the sounds as the daughter guide you with directions. For non-blind people, there's a joystick on the screen, though it's kinda transparent. At battle, you have to swipe to the direction of the enemy's sound at the right time. That might sound easy, but it's not that simple. You have to relax, close your eyes, and let the sounds and your imagination guide you to victory"

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "It's fun in the beginning, but gets boring pretty quickly. All the courses seem to be randomly generated, but only between the few different obstacles, so everything is repetitive. The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

I've given you an actual proof for why your app is dysfunction and inaccurate. Still no response. As a reminder, 1/1 @ 400bpm != 8/8 @ 400bpm. This decision saved your developers a lot of memory, but it made the app dysfunctional. 👎",

It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",

There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

            "Whimsical! Although the graphics are somewhat mundane, the game is an overall barrel of laughs. A real two dimensional, kinda dark, side splitter. The main character, \"The Hitmaster\", joyfully executes all types of people, from commoners to law enforcement officers with a Looney Toones, throwback effect. So whether you're 8 or 80,you'll get a kick outta this game. I'd recommend it as a stress relief, or a way to entertain one's self and friends.",
            "Fun mindless entertainment. However as with many other similar PlayStore games it is riddled with a disproportionate amount of ads. Time to uninstall. I appreciate that ads are required for resources and there are many other apps that manage ads well. However the ads should be secondary to the app experience not the other way around. The way it's designed it feels like gameplay is the interruption amid a stream of ads. Try playing the game yourself and read your other reviews that say the same.",
            "Bombarded with ads but it's a mobile game. The game is visually pleasing and has a nice design. However there is no difficulty scaling whatsoever. Instead of the game getting harder with each level it just gets more creative in terms of how you're killing the badies. For example, I'm on level 55 and there's only one possible place I can shoot and I only need one bullet, there's a chain reaction and you win the round. This makes the game boring stale and repetitive. Good concept poor execution",
            "Basically just a rigged slot machine, the puzzles are super easy, if you want to skip a level you have to watch an ad. On top of that their is an ad after every level. When you get the the \"gun shop\" you either have to watch an ad to get the \"free\" \"gun\" and it's always the wore gun, there are chance mechanics but they are rigged to give you the lowest prize automatically. I have been playing for months and never gotten any better than the worse prize. Money grab, that's it.",
            "I've been playing for an hour nearly now, its a decent enough shooting puzzle game to waste some time on, though it gets repetitive, but I downloaded it because of the pipe puzzles which are shown in the store images. Havent seen any of these at all and it doesn't look like anyone else has either. The developers aren't addressing this issue in responses to reviews pointing this out either. Hint: turn WiFi and data off to stop constant interruption."

            "absolutely loved this app. I have been using it for months but after the recent update, they made the makeup tool vip. I'm probably gonna delete the app now since it was my most used tool and i can't afford it now",
            "This app has been pretty valuable for me over the years that I've been using it. I tolerated when they decided to lock some features, since the more essential tools remained free and are uniquely useful enough to keep the app. I just had to look elsewhere for the other stuff. But when I went to use it today, I noticed they locked even more features - the essentials, aka the tools they've been most notable for. A pretty foolish move, honestly. So I'll be deleting.",
            "Reshape tool now requires a paying subscription, and it's not cheap! You used to be able to use it, you just needed to watch an ad whenever you saved your photo, but I guess they've gotten greedier. It was the only reason I used Facetune at all - all of the other tools are free on many other apps. Save yourself the trouble and money, just download any free photo editor.",
            "Certain things aren't free anymore, I don't like how you guys are taking the best free features away just to force people into subscribing. I also see how you guys made some features free which are tools I don't use for editing. This used to be the perfect app for selfie editing, for a long time too! But now it's useless to me. You guys are a sad case. I would give it 5 stars but no thanks. Uninstalling",
            "When I first downloaded this only a few of the edit options weren't available for free. It seems every time I go to edit now, more free things are getting taken away. Before it was reasonable, it's just ridiculous at this point. Looking to try different apps because trying to force users into buying your subscription is insane."

Controls are locked in place though, on the non-assisted accelerator button layout, so button pressing is unreliable, as I have to contort my hands to play. Game needs customizable buttons layouts. Without it, I find myself restarting races often and quitting.",
            "Good graphics. But the sounds of engine when watching replay is annoying. Nice controls but a bit small. I hope we could somehow modify the controls or change it's size and positions. But it's still a good game. Hope you could fix my issues. For the 5 stars ✨ Thanks and good job guys.",
            "I love every bits of update that this game provided with. The UI menu has been remodeled good as well. •) However, there is this bug/glitch with the Arrow button whenever I press Brake and a Turn at the same time to turn corner, the Arrow button sometimes did not respond to turn. In some case, it respond, but then off respond again. Please consider to fix that. •) Still about Arrow keys. Is it possible to make it a little bit bigger? There is a huge gap between Arrow and Handbrake after all.",
            "Good graphics, very fun rally game. However i can't seem to check my money and need to press unlock some expensive cars then it will only show how much i lack and then i'll know my money......and hopefully can change the size of buttons...it needs to get bigger....",
            "The game is great, the graphics are good. But I feel like a freeplay/practise mode would be good too. You could do laps and laps to try and get your best lap time down lower and lower. If you could please add this to the game it would make it even better."

Still…dissatisfied with your service. I tried the \"refresh\" button, but it didn't work. I pay almost ￥800 a month. I don't deserve your poor service. Fix it ASAP!",
            "This app has not updated since first connecting with 3 other phone numbers over 21 hrs ago. I know for a fact at least one of them is not still at home! Every time I push the Refresh button, it simply takes me to the screen to sign up for the \"no ads. Premium version\" for $9.00+ per month!!!",
            "Didn't pull up nothing right. Looked up a phone number wrong name with the number. Wrong address, wrong name. Everything was wrong. Suppose to have a 21 day Free trial but everytime I look up a number or email it charge me 0.50 when it should be free. This app is no good. Give it all 0 on all levels. 4.5 is a lie should be 0.0",
            "This app is horrible. Worse than useless really. It hardly ever updates phone locations, we're not talking a couple of hours behind but a couple of DAYS behind. Completely worthless. Even when I close app and restart it, it still won't update the locations. If you ever really needed to know where someone was this would be NO help! Don't waste your time or storage space on this app! The developers response is not true. EVERY phone we had this on had this issue!",
            "This app was great to start off with but after a few weeks it stopped working. I still have my son's location for 4 days ago, despite refreshing numerous times. I've found the only way to get it working again is to uninstall and re-install. Not ideal. I downloaded this app so I could make sure my son was safe on his way to and from school."

            "I used to spend many hours typing quotes up on word documents and have tried a few different invoicing apps over the years to try and get my evenings back. None of them where good enough that I kept on using them. Then I found powered now, my paper work is done in a fraction of the time and looks so much more professional. There is so much more to it other then just invoicing and quotes for example; Diary management, certificates and warning notices, the list goes on. The customer service team are fantastic if have any questions. love it. Thanks Powered now team.",
            "Its a terrific little app for business. Been luving it now for 3-4 years. I haven't managed to get my head around the project feature as haven't given it enough attention. I luv this app so much that if I were on the future development team I would make a bell and a whistle here and there. Invoice history feature would be great to send or print. Another little improvement would be to free the text up. Let the user cut and paste info don't lock up data. Brilliant App!",
            "Was brilliant for a couple of years but now they want double the cost just so someone else can use a laptop to input even though we only use laptop or phone not both at same time. so cancelled found cheaper product doing the same",
            "Pros; plenty of useful features all in 1 app, took me 5 min to get to grips, user friendly. Cons; app crashed 5 times in 1 hours use. No dashboard. when typing adds double first letter so always need to delete and retype. Receipt pic in expenses is unreadable as saves in very low res and sideways with no option to rotate. EICR cert layout is way off on final pdf so definitely not suitable to send to client. Verdict; App unstable and too many bugs. Would expect less errors for the price.",
            "My company use this app all day every day it's fantastic the guys at powered now are helpful and good service, when a update like with any software happens the staff at powered now help you. this app will save you many hours in admin. i would ignore any bad reviews, as I run a very busy company useing this app for nearly 2 years it's a great help and well worth the money. good job powered now : )"

The app helps make it easier for families to care for a loved one – no matter where they are.\r\n\r\nThe app helps a family detect if a loved one is struggling. For example, it tells you if they are becoming forgetful or not maintaining their regular daily routines, such as remembering to take medicine. And it tells you if their physical activity is decreasing. It’s important to detect a decrease in physical activity because if they don’t receive some additional help then they could be at an increased risk of having a fall or suffer with reduced independence.\r\n\r\nThe app is technically advanced and features multiple built-in phone sensors. These sensors can give a family an advance warning that a loved one is struggling and lets you respond to ensure they receive the care they need.\r\n\r\nA built-in motion sensor automatically lets the family know when (say) Grandmother moves or picks up her phone. In the morning it is reassuring to receive a message telling you your loved one has woken up at their regular time. And if you don’t get the message you know to call her and check everything is ok. \r\n\r\nThe app lets you setup daily recurring reminders for your loved one, for example, at 10:00 every morning your Grandfather’s phone has a notification to (say) reminder him to take medicine. And you receive a message when they do it. It helps you to see if a person is maintaining their regular daily routines.  You can set this up from your phone – and select the reminders and tasks to appear on your loved ones phone. \r\n\r\nMobile phones and tablets offer many benefits but for some older adults they struggle to use them as part of their daily lives. Perhaps they forget to charge the battery or they don’t keep it close by for when they need it (the phone is left untouched and forgotten).  The app helps a family to support a loved one to establish and maintain a daily routine of having a phone charged and close by. The app tells you if your loved ones phone battery gets low and it tells you when they charge their phone – so you can call and remind them if they forget to charge their phone.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed to help your elderly loved one with ‘everyday living’. The term ‘Everyday Living’ is incredibly important and encompasses:  (i) remaining socially engaged; (ii) continuing with activities that give life meaning; (iii) contributing to family or community; (iv) not feeling ‘burdensome’ to their families; and (v) continuing the role as caregiver.\r\n\r\nThe app links phones together to create a safe private group that helps people share, care and keeps people in touch.  The apps built-in sensors mean an elderly relative receives a continuous stream of family news feed events from their children and grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nPlease ask all your family to download the app and join your private group.\r\n\r\nWe hope you find the app useful.

But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",
            "I have turned off all notifications. And I'm still getting notifications on everything, every 30 minutes. I just want to follow my team, at my leisure. If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

            "I tried this a few times. @ first I didn't get anything but this time it seemed to have gone haywire! It even started speaking in different languages. Then it got stuck in the same movements turning on & off 2 different controls. Sorry, but had to uninstall. Some1 mentioned in another review of a man & woman talking, got that too but couldn't understand what they were saying. The pointer took over, typed the alphabet but u can't type anything. Read directions a few x's, never touched phone.",
            "Wait my friend! I can already speak to the dead but even though I forgot how to understand in the first place was because I was already hearing a white noise the still occurring in my ears. But great work on putting great effort on it and seems pretty understandable to those who like to communicate to the dead. God bless you all and good luck!!!",
            "Seems to be responding to ghost draw, and spirit box. But I can't type in questions, but it seems like the spirit is essentially going through the alphabet, and numbers like it was interpreting communication all over again. Any help so I can type questions through the text, and or a explanation of the type function would be great.Still exploring. My first day with it.Thanks!",
            "The directions were a bit overwhelming and @ 1st didnt think it was working, but a few minutes in the pointer started moving on its own, so i pushed the back to menu and i still heard voices, and the pointer again starting moving random @1st then started choosing which tool 2 use. 1st to draw then menu then white noise then keyboard. Nvr spelling anything but going thru every letter n #. Great tool just takes lots of patience but it does work. 4 those that dnt like it maybe these tools arent 4 u"

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "The game is really fun. There are way too many ads but it's a free game so I'm willing to accept them. I like that you can also watch a video for 3 extra moves if needed, no strings attached, no payments, no coin cost. The only real issue I have is occasionally it won't let me place a rope in the end slot which then means I have to fiddle with the order and can mean I lose the level. It's not always it's just a little annoying, even when I position it carefully it happens.",
            "TOO MANY ADS. NOT WORTH IT. Gave it 5 stars yesterday...big mistake. One star is all it really deserves. It is fun but after each 'level' (which takes anywhere from 30 sec to 2 min)you are BOMBARDED with 2 or more BLARING ADS lasting more than the play itself!! I am uninstalling this game. Actually, all-in-all, not enjoyable at all. Trust me when I tell you not to take up space on your phone. (BTW, developed in Turkey, not the USA) It would be more enjoyable to pick your nose.",
            "At first I was enjoying it, but soon I founded it very addictive and annoying at the same time, due to the very short time they give you to solve the difficult ones, it's taking me about 20 attempts to solve just one , very stressful and it's starting to make me mad, plus it has a lot of long adds I'm uninstalling it.",
            "While I am enjoying this game as a way to relax in between moments, I have found no use for the coins collected. You use them to purchase the visual mods but you can also win these. I'd adjust it to a leveling system or provide MANY more options for purchase. With the adds, while frequent, I have seen much worse. My only issue with them is that when I first started playing most would automatically be muted. As I often listen to audiobooks this was a great selling point. Please bring this back.",
            "At first the game was enjoyable. Nice way to spend a few seconds. But the tangles are repetitive. With 3 or 4 ropes and only 5 spaces to use to untangle, there aren't a lot of options. I'm up to level 450. I have over 165,000 coins. I still have no idea what to do with them. And, as other reviews as said, the ratio of ad watching to actual game play is way out of balance. An adult themed pregnant wife, cheating husband game app ad when children could be playing is inappropriate."

Just use the normal app or website. This isn't phising...my account is banned cos my credit card isn't apparently supported by yourselves.!",

After your latest update all bugs have emerged. 1st of all im using your mobile app, everytime i enter a chat room and pick up a user to view, i have to always reload their cam and its inconvenient and very annoying. 2nd, the mic. I cant seem to mute it permanently if i want to, and the name of the dj (whoever they are) are reflected on the bottom screen of the app. That was very unpleasant to see and always annoying. Please fix the app asap i like using it. Thanks",

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "It's and ok game, I just wish there were more mini games and the different areas for animals should be such high levels to get. Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "This used to be a decent feature of pixels but now it is so convoluted that it's just a nuisance. It doesn't recognize my voice EVER, not even if I prompt it by swiping. Sometimes it pops up randomly when I'm driving and then it still gets nothing. Microphone issue? Doubtful. Also when it pops up on the bottom it covers the keyboard lol great! The list of negatives goes on and on. Why do I need to \"train\" my google assistant every 2 weeks when it's constantly listening to me anyway? Garbage app.",
            "It's an amazing thing; to have this kind of technology readily available at all times, on a personalized level, and small enough to fit in your pocket... for free. However, Google Now was far superior in functionality. Not sure why the step backwards in this seemingly mandatory \"upgrade\", but regardless, it's pretty amazing. I use \"Ok, Google\" probably 10-15 times a day for all sorts of things. It can even answer some two-part questions, and handles most tasks without the need to intervene.",
            "Yes I have numerous suggestions: 1) is for it to read what I ask it to specifically any text message, new or old. 2). If I'm driving down the road and I ask it to tell me something or read the entire paragraph or whatever I don't want it to stop I wanted to recognize that I'm driving and it needs to tell me that it ignores what I'm asking. 3). It would be nice to refine searches previous ones and edit them. 4). More interactive follow-on conversation option. 5,). Able to diagnose, troubleshoot",
            "This used to be a great app but just recently it stopped working at very random times. For example if I ask \"Show me a picture of Mark Hamill\" it will respond with \"Sorry. I don't understand.\" Also, I use the voice feature all the time and the app has stopped hearing my voice (not all the time but again very randomly). Since I use the app frequently, this has become really annoying. At this point, it's about 50% unusable right now, so if you could fix these issues it would be great.",
            "I'm not entirely sure what's wrong but I've trained it a couple times and it still doesn't respond to me but if I use voice search and Google reads a paragraph to me from the web and it happens to have \"OK Google\" or \"hey Google\" in it, it responds. my voice does not at all sound like the default voice that it uses to read, but it still responds regardless. that's the only time I can get it to respond usually."

            "This app has been fantastic! Completely accurate instantly down to the penny. I also want to add, I have had this app awhile now and I couldn't be more pleased. Someone was taking money out of my account. Huntington caught the suspicious activity immediately. I lost a minimal amount that they are reimbursing. Thank you for saving the rest! Amazing!!!",
            "I find it extremely annoying to be constantly asked if I want to use new tools. These banners get in my way and closing it is just one more step I need to do before having my standard view, without the annoying, unsolicited new feature. It's always something new being offered. At one point I was asked if I want to see how my monthly expenses break down and I said \"No\". But months later it was added to my view anyway. I DON'T care, but they decided I am going to see it anyway. Very annoying",
            "Wheel goes round and round and can't login. Rediculous! It's been weeks now and no help! I still can not use the budget or analysis tools now for weeks. I get no support. The at that is online is so much better, it works. No one seems to care to help. Oh well, that's a shame for Huntington to have an app that doesn't work. What does that say about the bank.",
            "With the Android 11 update, the mobile check deposit was temporarily shut down. When it was available again, the camera options were not functional properly. I was able to take a picture of the front of my check and had difficulty taking a photo of the back of the check. This was because the camera seemed to be distorted oddly, like a fun house mirror.",
            "I have loved the app for years and use it to check my accounts almost daily. However, last week after my pixel did an update, the app is telling me I can't use it for mobile deposits? I don't do very many a year, but hopefully Huntington will upgrade their software soon. Other than that it's great.....but please fix the mobile deposit portion soon!"

            "Excellent! This game is so cool. It has great graphics and such an amazing story. But there are lot of missing features compared to the other similar games like (GTA). There should be a: 1. Open World mode, like Freeplay. 2. More cars (Jet and Airplanes) and weapons (Sniper, Bat, etc.) 3. Can enter house and shops. That's all. I hope this game expands more.",
            "This is a touch of perfection! Payback² is second to none. The ultra graphics, the smooth play, the game performance, the small size, the many modes ypu can choose to play, name them! The list is endless. If you want that adrenaline rush, get the game! To the devs: I think a camera inside the vehicle, a tougher law enforcement squad, more telephone missions will take Payback² to a higher level.",
            "Genuinely, I loved the game and I can't find the better game than this. Amazing gameplay. I've been playing this game for hours. Many times I downloaded this. But all the updates I saw, no new customization settings found till. No new looks, no new faces . And no money reward for levels, but the customization needs money. Not enough money for daily rewards. I hope I can see the settings all I wanted on the next update. Besides this is a best game.",
            "This game is very enjoyable, explicit and diversified. This is not a p2w game at all but u can invest some money if u want to buy skins that is not so very important. The controls are good but my only problem is that the missions are repeatative and after some time u cannot enjoy it as much when u first play it. In short becomes tedious after some time. I think there should be new features like story mode in multiplayer, accessible buildings and bigger maps like GTA. Btw story modes are boring.",
            "The game is okay , but a little upgrade is needed. The shout-out with cops should look more interesting by allowing the cops to use helicopter in search of criminals. More options where we can make use of hotel, bars etc with an option to use prostitutes will make the game more interesting. The city need to be expanded too. More tasks and levels should also he included I'm giving 4 Stars for this game"

            "Game itself is good, but customers service and support is total zero. T4f only need your money and that's all. You'll never get support from them if anything happens in the game. Someone hack my account that i spent goo few ££ on it and totally destroyed. I've got in touch with customer service straight after someone logged in from different device and asked for help so they block them, unfortunately they reply 3days later when everything was destroyed and told me \"sorry comma,we can't help you\"",
            "This is a great game. I am having issues that has been going on for a long time. It looks like they tried to resolve the issues but it still exist. I have 4 different profiles and for all four, any talent points I acquired, the game doesn't allow me to use them.",
            "Its hard to play game specially REFT of LEGEND, the events unbalance the player during matching. Other events is good, the concern is adjast the research time of all research so that weak can balance to the strongeist and so for the player spend money to become strong.",
            "I like the game. It's not hard to play. Also you don't need to get powerful. I've been playing for a few days and my ranking is number one. That's amazing.",

            "It's been quite the ride for me with this series and it all started with Blitz. Seeing how it evolved from its humble \"Temple Run-esque\" style of gameplay to racing against fellow Beach Buggy characters and making it to the top, now racing with powerup decks, a leveling system and chest rewards. Honest, I want to see things that are in the current game added to this classic so there's more of a reason to come back to this \"oldie, but a goodie\". More vehicles, more customization options, etc. 😁",
            "I remember playing this game when I was 5 decided to play it again and hearing that guitar filled me with nostalgia. The game is addicting and the controls are great. And also to the people who are complaining about racing in the game and how the drivers start before you, they made 2 racing games about that. All I want is more themes like night, rain,snow etc. Other than that amazing game I loved it to bits. Also RIP the 800000 pelicans I ran over",
            "I think the game is pretty cool. But it would have been better if there were stages to unlock. Because playing it is like playing a temple run facing game but it's alright. I mean, the graphics are ok and the racing 8s really fun. It brings the experience of actually controlling a cartoon character in racing.",
            "In this game we explore good places, the music is excellent ,we have goods power ups, good contols, good characters, good cars .We can paint cars . This game is very very amazing. We can never be lonely with this game",
            "Perfect for Android cheapies just the first one a bit like Street fighter two just keeps an eye on ya and it makes you play better. Another great game good bad and the coolest and best game, sometimes when I'm training I like to turn the volume down and listen to some choice music.🤠"

            "Last update was Jan 2019. I bring that up as no support for Android 10 or 11. Clearly developers abandon this game and didn't bother to take it out of Play Store. Putting that aside, ads will randomly start playing and will play every time you exit the game. Overall, lack of updates, too many ads, and poor graphics, I do not recommend this game.",
            "So much ads but meh the ads that i see if it looks like a fun game i get it that why i like ads and gave this a five star 🌟 its such a fun game i had it when i was a kid and i am just now geting it so its so much fun i love this game and games like this are fun so keep up the good work and dont Lise to the people that say your gane is bad there just jealous that you guys have a good game and that they cant make a super special game like this its the best game ever. Thx for the good game. By.",
            "I love it. I've no problem with this game more much better and no hassles without AD not anymore. Thanks God! Of course, I'm rating and gave them more than 5 stars, maybe, 9 out of 10. I absolutely love this game to making me 💯% calm and more much better relaxing while I'm stoned. 😵😵😵😜😂👌 Irishman41 😁👍🤑🤑🤑🙌🙌🙌",
            "This game is super fun, BUT the ads are ridiculous! I play lots of other free games and they don't have this many ads. More people would probably play if this changed.",
            "I love this game!!! Its super addictive!! The only thing i dont like is when it tells you to collect 3 gems but they dont give you any, same with when it says to collect 2 car prizes yet they dont drop any cars! Thats super annoying but my only complaint."

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "It works well and easy to use . A good app for beginners in drum set learning. Rate it 4 star because some lessons are not opening up requires one to run an add",
            "Latest Update trashed everything. please fix. Latest update has ruined all downloads. For now everyone AFFECTED by this BUG should go and clear the storage under you apps section. I'm on a Google Pixel 3 Android 11",
            "I am learning to play the guitar and so I need an app like this to help me record backing drum tracks for my practicing. I like the fact that you can see the parts and PLAY THEM and actually listen to the different sounds of the drum set...GREAT. What the app does not offer me, is the chance to place those sounds in a certain order, combine sounds and record the sequence and actually be able to use it as a backing track for your guitar learning. As it is, I see no practical use for it.",
            "I like the overall sound and smooth running of the app. I think it could be much better if you added more features such as being able to move around the pieces to arrange the kit in a way I like, an option to lock the bass drum with a cymbal so every time I hit the cymbal it also hits the bass drum automatically, add a choke to the cymbal, maybe individually adjust each kit piece's volume, and perhaps more options for different sounds (maybe a china, a third crash, a different ride/bell).",
            "I gave it 4 stars because of the delay I'm expiriencing on my tablet. It is fine on my phone and works well but I think it's cause I have an older version on it. I just got my tablet so I'm guessing I have the newest version of it. Please fix the delay and I'll rewrite this with a 5 star rating. The app deserves a 10 star rating when it's working well. It really is a great app. Just that one little🤏 prob. I have faith that it'll bs fixed. Thank you 🙂"

            "The gameplay is good, but for the love of dogs, RANDOM POP UP ADS, WITH SOUND, AFTER EVERY MATCH? SERIOUSLY? Come on BearBit Studios, you're better than this. I know you can fix it by playing with wifi off, but what if i want to stream music while playing? For un online game I'll put up with short ads, as servers cost money to run, bust smashy road has NO online and thus NO SERVERS. this is outrageous.",
            "I play this game a lot, and it is really fun. But i have some suggestions for a future update. 1, the tanks are too fast, 2 the tanks reload speed is also too fast. 3 the car f1 needs something else, like a 5x faster cash, because it dosen't do anything but go fast. 4 please make it so that the cars don't slow down when they are in the grass. I also want to add a new car in the game, it would be a car that when u get arrested, you turn into a cop car and get 5 seconds to get away.",
            "I love this game i absolutley love it the chase speed cars etc is a lot of fun but theres 1 problem. When you get exploded by an oil truck sometimes you get thrown under the map which causes you to fail and i think that should be fixed but other then that 10/10 thank you.",
            "In my personal opinion smashy road wanted is in okay game however I have witnessed a few glitches during the gameplay your probably going to ask what glitches am I discussing about allow me to explain your driving on the road right? then suddenly you crash into a gasoline truck falling threw the map another thing when accidentally bump into one of the bigger police vehicles when you try to back up the car proceeds to go forward eventually you get arrested I do not recommend this game"

If they don't tell me how many are there I don't waste anymore time. However this one did tell me but I can't hardly hear are understand them. The spirits have an accent like Brandon which seems strange ? Does that mean there are no american spirits there. Maybe someone with good equipment could record and make out what they are saying.",

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

The rather jarring stone-down sound seems to be impossible to turn off, even with it set to off and the device volume turned down. And the screen lock should be inhibited when a game is being played. It's very irritating when the screen turns of when you are thinking. It should also be possible to turn the distracting atari warning off.",

Actually I don't want to give this app 1 star also but there is no option for 0 star if it would be there then I would chose 0 star only. This is the worst app I saw ever. Who is reading this comment before downloading/after downloanding I request them to not download this app and give 1 star.",

        "description": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\r\n\r\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \r\n•\tbehavioral profiles\r\n•\ttactical briefings\r\n•\tspecific investigative questions\r\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\r\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\r\n\r\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\r\n\r\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\r\n\r\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\r\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\r\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\r\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\r\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\r\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\r\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\r\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\r\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\r\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\r\n\r\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.

        "description": "INTRO:\r\n\r\nCreated to save U.S. military lives, Tactical NAV was the first MGRS-focused app commercially available to the public, and it has been proven to be effective in both combat and training environments.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\n\r\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and extremely accurate mobile-targeting platform built specifically for U.S. military warfighters.\r\n\r\nTactical NAV’s journey began when two Soldiers were killed in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J.

            "I was excited when I got this app. I watched the video before I purchased the app and It showed that there was tools for planing operations, like custom front line drawings and zones. Points that are for infantry and tanks other things. But when I purchased the app none of those features were on there. I don't know if those features arnt avalibe on Android or if I am doing something wrong. Other than no tools the app is a very good offline map app. If I am doing something wrong can you tell me?",
            "Like other disgruntled Android users, really disappointed that none of the advertised features are available on this platform. I've got free apps that offer more functionalities. A shame, I was really looking forward to using it on exercises and missions. Edit: thanks for the response, will try again when the app is updated. Good luck!",
            "Solid app with decent functionality. Really needs a landscape mode on android devices to integrate better with chest mounted solutions. Overall it accomplishes what it's designed for, just needs an update to refine some minor things like overlays and waypoints. Phase line and route planning tools would be killer. Not sure if functionality similar to BFT/JCR/FBCB2 is possible due to security concerns, but that'd be great to monitor other unit members on the app.",
            "Although there's not much to do with the app currently I am fully confident you are doing everything you can to make it better and I do love the concept. I can't wait for the new update!!! UPDATE - IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A YEAR (NEXT MONTH) SINCE AND STILL NOTHING. 10/26/2019 Original Review",
            "The app doesn't have a fraction of the feature they list on the website for Android. Doesn't even draw a line to show distance between points, and if you hit the delete button it deletes all the point you placed instead of the selected one. All and all real disappointment. false advertising"

            "The game has potential, but the movement controls need work BIG TIME. When trying to move using the right side of the sceen, there are many times the character freezes, or you can only swing 5° to aim when you need to swing 35°-40°. And up/down sucks too! NOT GOOD GUYS! Make it move on inertia from pad movement and you'll have a winner. I'd love the game then, but unfortunately I'm uninstalling because I don't want the repeated frustration of getting shot because I can't move to shoot.",
            "Graphic is sucks, but with only a small size of this game, so it is ok. But the control of this game is all wrong. It is actually impossible to shoot while aim, but the enemies just keep moving. It is easily to mispress buttons from aim to shoot or sometime even swap weapon. Recommend to add a secondary shoot button at the left side of the panel or add a customize layout in the setting.",
            "Controls are all in wrong places. You have to aim the rifle with the right hand, and pull trigger with right hand, while left hand is moving the sniper back and forth. These controls should have the rifle aimimg on the left, with the sniper mone back and forth in s fixed icpn on the left, and trigger on the right. The scope should be on the left with aiming the rifle...,will uninstall. Cannot aim and shoot .",
            "Gr8 game, but in a future update please move the firing button or the aiming area to opposite side of the screen , because at present if you are aiming you cannot shoot if you move your thumb to the fire button the victim has moved and you lose your shot. Please help with this. Overall this is very good game. I have downloaded your other similar games, well done. ,",
            "This game use to be fun and enjoyable. Now I can barely shoot a guy, with that huge black square hindering my views. AND the night mode thing isn't doing it for it. The ads are DEADLY !!! 🙄 well it's been great while it lasted. Time to delete it now."

The only thing I could say could be improved is the amount of ink you get. The bosses have GIANT vehicles and I'm on level 550 and dont have much ink. The ink cost so much after you buy about 5 lots and it doesnt give you that much. Overall, I love this game!",

            "It reminds me of robot wars. Draw your car and destroy. Glitch where car flies into the sky and you cant tell what happening is a little annoying. New enemies and bosses in the future would be nice. Maybe harder difficulties with them having cannons and a smarter AI that moved on its own.",
            "It's pretty simple and addicting. I just wish it were more challenging. Right now the AI reacts to whatever you're doing. It won't charge on its own or anything, you basically control both your car and the other car. You can also overpower yourself to the point of almost everything being too easy to be any fun. Wall-less maps are pretty much worthless because you can just ram the other car off immediately. Stronger and more intelligent enemies would be a great addition."

            "My grandson loves this app. He was five when he started playing and now he is in grade one and is still finding it stimulating. I tried some others but they were too advanced for him. The repetitive nature of it is stimulating and rewarding because he feels like he is doing work. But he knows what to do and it isn't overwhelming. I thought that he would find it too simple because his favorite game is Minecraft, which is very challenging. But the music and graphics really strikes a chord.",

            "Good game, good game, not alot of problems. First thing though, the ads...theres a bit many of them. Second problem, i don't know if i'd call this a problem or not but sometimes my penguin can bounce under the screen and it goes without him there. Its just a shadow...i made it to a million and i don't know what to do with this ._.",
            "This game should be renamed \"Admasters\" lol. Ads after every single play and in between plays as well. Want more coins? Watch a video. Didn't want the extra coins? Here's a video anyway! Did good or bad? Here's a video. Want a free treasure chest or upgrade? Watch another video!!!! Don't want ads, pay up $$$ Fun game and funny characters ruined by horribly intrusive ads.",
            "The game would be pretty awesome, but it's absolutely teeming with ads. You practically can't do anything with out having an ad shoved in your face. Want to know how ridiculous and greedy this app is? If you click to double your earnings after a turn, you get an ad; if you choose not to double your earnings (which is a grayed out option that is intentionally designed to look unclickable) you almost always STILL have to wait through an ad. The ads make this game unplayable.",
            "I like the gameplay, but there is one thing that I don't like: the failure animation should your penguin travel too slowly after falling into a water hole. Your penguin is torn to shreds by a school of hungry piranha, with blood shown. I would request the developers to either change this scene to something more family friendly, or change the rating of the app from E to E10+ for mild blood.",
            "I wanna give four stars as this is a nice game and the problems are more iritating.😣 everything is nice but there is more ads which is annoying and most of the time my penguin goes under the earth..i dont know how it is happenning....i can view only the shadow of my penguin....this things occurs most of the time....more and more annoyed by this😐"

            "This app is amazing. I know gabor patches to improve eye sight but the way this app displays it makes it so effective on the brain. I am now seeing things the way I saw them when I was a kid; so vivid. Sometimes I just go outside just to look at things. This is amazing. However I found it a bit difficult at the beginning on how to play the game, but once I got it, I play it everyday for at least 20 minutes. The developer should make a very detailed tutorial on how to play with video examples",
            "App functioned, free. Like the candy game but with Gabor patches. If the benefit of Gabor is just the result of focusing on patches, then this game should help improve the visual problems that other programs with Gabor patches do. If there is more to neuroadaptation training than just focus (for example, if the order of the series matters), then who knows if this will help. I will do it for 20 minutes a day & report back on whether it helps my halos and ghost images from a multifocal IOL.",
            "This app is basically unusable (by anyone except the developer, perhaps). The description calls it \"a match-3 game\", but there are no instructions on HOW you match those 3. I've tried tapping, sliding, long-pressing, and nothing works. And the \"how to play\" link does nothing.  Don't waste your time.",
            "Well it is basically a game but I'm not sure that it actually helps with certain eyesight issues. Simple",
            "You need to explain how people can play the game. What do we have to do? Do we have to wait until all patterns are aligned? How do we do it? Slide 3 patterns downwards or vertically? And how do we know whether we did good or need to improve? How do we know our eyesight can become better? Are there levels of difficulties? What are those symbols for? Change colours? Why? Etc."

            "This is the cutest game I've ever played! I even have the other game: My Talking Angela! Yesterday Angela turned 5 years old on My Talking Angela! I think the same thing will happen on My Talking Tom 2! I love Talking Angela sooooo much! Even though people say there's a man in her eyes, I never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever see the man. Talking Angela is sooooo cute!",
            "So I was playing I noticed a vid that came up on YouTube ig was on the news too so I went to check it out and when I came back at first I didn't believe it then wen I got back I saw that the makeup was off her face and floating in the air. I when back where you download it and then saw the pictures of a man in her eyes. I went to go crash my phone the I heard something in the woods so I looked the doors around my house. Then my sister was asleep and I fall asleep too.",
            "Omg literally I just played this from I year and I was playing and I notice that the app is haunted but I love the cat so what just happened is that I just open the app today and angela eyes were red and It was like someone is there behind her and I just ran that time to show that to my parents and there was no one in the chair but I though that it may be some problem of phone and I told hi angela she told hi I am a devil ,i am a devil,and that time i was very scared and i dont want to keep that",
            "I haven't played this game yet I did this ad before I started and going in the game but I heard it's very creepy and if you zoom into the eye then you can see a manner something then yeah I just look on YouTube and I saw a bunch of pictures I mean and then I see that someone is watching you when you play the game so I'm very scared to start of the game right now so yeah wish me good luck so I won't die okay",
            "I was playing and I noticed that there was something or someone in her eye. I saw some things that looked like an and a couch. I screenshoted the eyes and saw those. I thought it was really creepy. I instantly deleted the game after I discovered the things in the eyes. Kids don't download this game without your parents. I think the person that made the game was the person in the eyes. I rate this 1 star cause I thought it was creepy and uncomfortable having someone just staring at you, thats all"

Either than that it's really a good game 😘😍😘😍😘",

This game is one of the most annoying games I have ever come across. This game seems to be a very interesting game but when I try to play, it starts to fool. Please do something about it because I cannot just waste my bundle to achieve nothing. I'm very bored today because of this game.",

When we this game the graphics and background are merging and the people in the game they are also merge with each other and their is no so long and hard level but when we go to full the tank of petrol we have to give some many money 💰. I don't like this game very much. I will give only 2stars Thank you!",
            "From all rickshaw game this is the best game as campare to other Rickshaw game. I like this game. Just one thing there is problem that when you win all the levels there is no things to do with this game and you have to unistall this game. So I want to give some improvement that if you make the endless game then it's good and also improve your graphics. Graphics are not good",
            "The petrol gets finished very soon. And the driver says the same line \" I Come as soon as possible\" and I noticed that the auto do not have the excess to airport , garage , railway stations etc. And another thing I Noticed that the game is different from the pics given in the discription . But I liked the multiplayer mode."

            "Everytime something wrong happens, the developpers say it's because of the internet👎. They never make up for what you've lost. They never try to solve the problem. They ask you to send videos and proofs ( do you really think that we're videoing every move we make in the game it's absurd) So after you send one they ask for another proof. Like they are always trying to find a way to say \"NO\" and it's your fault player not ours so they always get the player frustrated 👎👎👎",
            "It's in an unknown language. Can't understand anything. Uninstalling. Update. Developer reply is not the solution. You can check playstore language of user and select that or ask user on first use to select language. It seems strange something is being downloaded and no way to see what's going on because you don't understand anything on the screen.",
            "My rating adjusted again to 5 stars. My rating was 4/5 .now after every update they are changing gold bundles offers to be less than before.also spider points they removed it without prior notice and keep telling me it is changing always ! Finally they have been disabled 50,000 gold offers in black market. So why to play this game and to pay money ? If management will not fix this issues.i will delete and not recommend anybody to install this kind of wasting time and money games. Thanks.",
            "Hello the game is very nice but I have a comment at the last update You need to improve grocery offers and increase them in all resources because the new update is considered to erase all the premium luxury offers. Please solve the problem September 10 update eliminated all the great and luxurious features Therefore, we hope to solve the problem to not lose many users as soon as possible, Thanks.",
            "This game is AMAZING! You can build so many cool tanks and it's even multiplayer? I am from Sudan but right now I am in New Zealand. I don't really care that the language is arabic because it's my secondary language. Thanks for being very active, and responding to my review (If you did) Thank you so much for the wonderful game! Congratulations on 5 million downloads! I hope this can give the developers some motivation."

            "This game is not exactly what you are thinking of. Don't dare to download this game. I was also fooled as this game was in the top free list of Google Play Store. It has way too many ads. You clear each level and an ad arises. It doesn't need any Internet. ...still while downloading it shows that it need Internet access.....and that is only to show ads. It is not a PvP game. You just have to aim and shoot. In the maximum levels, there is no joystick to move. please do not download this game.",
            "The app description images are recieving, the actual graphics are kinda ok/good, but the game is quite laggy, the Sniper Rifle shakes when trying to aim & zoom towards your target, the zooming of the Sniper rifle should be made more handy & easily accessible so that we can shoot enemies faster, 2 stars overall coz I died even though I had taken a cover & guess what? It didn't even allow me to move around as it says we can by pressing on the left portion of the screen, I could move in lvl 2 only, after dying multiple times at lvl 3, I chose to delete this game. The fact that to proceed towards a mission by pressing the \"play\" button on top right corner also sucks, I know you guys want to earn money but reduce the amount of Pop-up ads, it's gonna irritate many people, I hope you're gonna work on the advice I provided and improve this game, thank you so much....hope to see a improved game next time!",
            "I am only playing it for last one day, and the overall experience is nice and swift. Although, I encountered a single issue i.e. once my mission was complete, the weapon kept on firing continuously, and it got carried to the beginning of the next mission as well. But the game is truly awesome, and I am loving it.",
            "i'm no ones critic, and i truly do hate giving a game a bad rating, but this game has way too many ads. for me, an ad was the first thing that loaded. i understand its a form of revenue for people who make games, but this is ridiculous. every level contained an ad going into it, and an ad coming out with no skip button. the game seemed fun, but i spent more time watching ads for candy crush, or fortnite, or some other game, that i just lost interest. its good to use ads but not this many!!!",
            "Too many ads, in the middle of your game there will be an ad. I understand that's how they make money but at least wait until after the round to play an ad. Also the graphics are terrible and the game itself gets frozen in a position. Overall dont download because if terrible graphics and bad glitches."

            "I've used Dolphin for several years now on iphone & android. Mostly its a great browser. My main problem is there seems to be a glitch in the settings versus what the browser actually does. For example i have turned on the option for \"Load previous tab on startup\", but this setting has NEVER worked. I would love to make this app my go to browser app but i really think settings should run as selected. I cant download any add-ons, or find & use Sonar. Support website links don't work.",
            "Tried to restore all my bookmarks and settings after a reinstall, but only a couple of bookmarks appear and none of the settings restore. I used to back up my settings regularly. Was logged in with my Google account. Might as well use another browser now seeing as I have to start all over.",
            "Voice Search doesnt work. It listens, starts to search, but fails to bring up any result, even for the simpliest commands like \"google\" or \"go to google\". Open tabs in background by default setting doesnt work. This browser is full of features but none of them work.",
            "Good, not great. Chrome is faster, but I hate Chrome which has the footprint of an elephant. I can open a link & let it switch to it, or open in background. Bookmarks system & mgmt is best ever seen - but no way to export & import bookmarks via a std file. Supposed to be able to sync to another device but doesn't. Incognito mode is so-so, sites recognize me right away despite only browsing incognito. Appears to have little or no support & help a waste of time. Probably abandoned & dying, tsk...",
            "Update 22/03/20: Downgraded to one star. Why? a) no option to show a site's URL rather than its title in the address bar: extremely insecure. b) does not retain current address when put in background or split screen, always reverting to 'home' instead: extremely annoying. c) contact e-mail address not accepting e-mails: extremely unhelpful."

She also said to cancel the booking and gave assurance that new expert would be alotted for the required slot. When I do that, the slots are shown booked. Why do they accept the requests if they are not available only. It was such a headache for me because I had to go somewhere in the evening and all other salons were fully booked for that day. Frst nd last experience.👎",

It shows 3 houses far away house-no. I tried to edit the house-no with the floor-no but not able to do it as it is allowing to set my address only via GPS. Allow users to manually type their address as well because at times the manual entry is more accurate than GPS generated house address.",

If you complain about that also there will not be any response from Housejoy.. For just saying there is a problem in AC stabiliser technician charged 900/- and after he lefts I got a message that the charges for the service is 143/- means he as taken 5 times high amount regarding which I have complained for more than 6 times."

Maybe you could add a few mini games. Oh also sometimes when I am doing tricks on my snowboard my game glitches and I can't move the steering and so that makes me get behind. So for anybody who's reading this if you get really aggravated when games glitch out you might not want to download this game. But other than that I would totally play this.",

All my one year old has to do is tap the screen and the drag bar comes down which covers the whole screen so he can get out of the game. Also there are ads that last at least a minute, but feels like forever when you're trying to keep them occupied. Other than that he loves the sensory games.",
