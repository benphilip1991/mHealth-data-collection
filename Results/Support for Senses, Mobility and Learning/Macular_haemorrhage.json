            "I don't like the app in terms of statistics. It asks to little questions, so results every time very different. Also it asks the same order of symbols for both eyes. So if your left eye is better, you can remember the sequence first, then use you memory to see better same characters for right eye. Also it gives very different scores for different test. Overall considering so many design flows I do not recommend using this app at all.",
            "I feel as if i see much more than test indicates. I can see long distances clearly. I had used my eye drops a few minues prior to the first test. Should i have put on my readers? I would like to communicate with someone to make sure i did the test right.",
            "It described my vision perfectly I was very satisfied with this it is accurate it blew me away that it was so! And I'm 65 years old. Would recommend!",
            "I like this app! it's not a certified doctor but I appreciate that I have at least the knowledge that I need to keep my Eye appointments. The test and instruction is pretty easy to understand. Pretty easy to understand the instructions.",
            "Fairly accurate except the test to see if your glasses are right for you. It said my glasses were not right for me. I tried the regular test with glasses on and had 100% vision in both eyes which tell me me my glasses are the right strength. Also the test to see if you have a stigmatism isn't right. It said I have a stigmatism in both eyes and my Son got the same result when he has 20/10 vision which is even better than 20/20 vision!"

        "description": "This eye test is designed to monitor a person's central visual field in the most pleasant, intuitive and stress-free way for FREE.\r\n\r\nVision test is useful for:\r\n- Patients with macular degeneration (usually instructed to monitor their vision daily)\r\n- House visits\r\n- Household tests for adults who have doubts if a doctor's visit is required\r\n- Nursing homes\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Random test charts to eliminate boring and repeating experiences;\r\n- Voice controls to help you navigate easier;\r\n- Smooth and intuitive interface with animations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis eye examination is of particular interest to reveal age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which mostly affects adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment for adults over 50 years. Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to pass this test a couple of times each year no matter what your age is.\r\n\r\nThe amsler grid used in this examination is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula (e.g. macular degeneration, Epiretinal membrane), as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain. A particular problem is the age-related macular degeneration.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is made with the best of intentions. The intuitive and flawless design allows you to navigate easily through the application. The voice guidance is provided during the test so that you don't need to move your mobile device near or far to read the instructions but instead you can hear the nice voice guiding you through different steps and actions. The voice can easily be muted and unmuted.\r\n\r\nIn the test, you will be given a small dot in the center of the grid. One should identify if any of the straight lines are wavy, missing or have other disorder. At the end of the test results will show whether the person has problems in central visual field or not for each eye separately.\r\n\r\nMore details about central visual field, macular degeneration, retina, eye examination tests and trainings as well as other eye related topics can be found in our news.eyeexamtest.com blog.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is continuously under improvement so your feedback is appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\n- Take the most comfortable position to relax.\r\n- Have a mild nature light and no glare on the phone screen.\r\n- Wear your contacts or glasses if you normally do.\r\n- Place your phone approx. 50 cm/20 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Cover one eye at a time with your hand.\r\n- Stare at the dot in the center. Do not let your eye drift from the center dot.\r\n- Try to identify if any of the straight lines appear wavy or bent,\r\n- Any of the boxes differ in size or shape from the others, or\r\n- Any of the lines are missing, blurry or discolored.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Languages:\r\n\r\n- English\r\n- Russian\r\n\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO:\r\nWe highly recommend using our Eye Care Plus that allows to pass a more detailed eye examination as well as train your eye muscles for better vision.\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyeexamtest.eyecareplus\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nThis application is not intended to replace optician's regular full examination.

In the context of this article, \"hemorrhoids\" refers to the pathologic presentation of hemorrhoidal venous cushions.\r\n\r\nHemorrhoidal venous cushions are normal structures of the anorectum and are anatomically present unless a previous intervention has taken place. Because of their rich vascular supply, highly sensitive location, and tendency to engorge and prolapse, hemorrhoidal venous cushions are common causes of anal pathology. Symptoms can range from mildly bothersome, such as pruritus, to quite concerning, such as rectal bleeding.\r\n\r\nAlthough hemorrhoids are a common condition diagnosed in clinical practice, many patients are too embarrassed to seek treatment. Consequently, the true prevalence of pathologic hemorrhoids is not known.In addition, although hemorrhoids are responsible for a large portion of anorectal complaints, it is important to rule out more serious conditions, such as other causes of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, before reflexively attributing symptoms to hemorrhoids.",

After doing the tests you should be able decide whether or not you should see an eye doctor. Doing the vision tests is fun, and you can also share the results with your friends on Facebook!\r\n\r\n**The app is in English! Please don't give me bad ratings because the app is not in your language!**\r\n\r\nThe application has 12 types of eye tests (6 FREE and 6 PRO)\r\n* Visual acuity tests\r\n* An Ishihara Color Blindness test\r\n* Color Cube GAME to test your vision and speed\r\n* 4 Amsler grid tests\r\n* An AMD test for macular degeneration\r\n* A Glaucoma survey\r\n* A Written test aka. how much do you know about the eye?\r\n* Contrast Sensitivity test\r\n* Landolt C/Tumbling E test\r\n* Astigmatism test\r\n* Duochrome test\r\n* An OKN Strip test\r\n* Red Desaturation test\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nDue to variations in each screen accuracy (screen size, brightness/contrast, resolution) the eye tests are not perfect. Holding a phone of approx 4\" screen size 30 cm/12 inches from your eyes would give you nearly accurate results. Hold it (place it) 52cm/20inches from your eyes if you have e.g. a 7\" tablet.\r\nDo not consider the tests in the app official tests. These tests only mean to give you an idea whether or not you should see an eye doctor or go on an eye therapy.\r\n\r\nVISUAL ACUITY\r\nThe visual acuity test is a routine part of an eye examination, particularly in case of vision problems. At a young age, these vision problems can often be corrected or improved. Undetected or untreated vision problems can lead to permanent vision damage.\r\n\r\nCOLOR BLINDNESS\r\nTest if your color blind or not.\r\n\r\nAMSLER GRID\r\nThe Amsler grid is a grid of horizontal and vertical lines used to check vision problems caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula as well as the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nAMD\r\nAge-related macular degeneration is a progressing eye condition that affects millions of people.\r\n\r\nGLAUCOMA\r\nGlaucoma is a group of diseases that damage the eye’s optic nerve and can result in vision loss. If left untreated, It can lead to blindness.\r\n\r\nCONTRAST SENSITIVITY\r\nA contrast sensitivity test checks for the ability to differentiate between light and dark.\r\n\r\nLANDOLT C\r\nThe Landolt C is the standard optotype for acuity measurement in most European countries.\r\n\r\nTUMBLING E\r\nThis test is the standard visual acuity test for people who cannot read the Roman alphabet. \r\n\r\nASTIGMATISM\r\nAstigmatism is a vision condition that causes blurred vision making it difficult to see fine details, either close up or from a distance.\r\n\r\nDUOCHROME TEST\r\nThis test is used to estimate whether you are long or short sighted.\r\n\r\nOKN STRIP TEST\r\nAn official test to test your vision for specific eye problems.\r\n\r\nRED DESATURATION\r\nThe optic nerve is sensitive to red, so when it is damaged, red-colored objects may appear dull, washed-out or faded. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to do if I get bad results?\r\n\r\nIf your results indicate you may have vision problems, you should see an eye doctor. Having regular eye examinations promotes eye health. It also allows your doctor to measure your vision and make the necessary changes to your prescriptions.\r\nYou can also download eye training apps to preserve your eye sight and improve vision. You should take better care of your eyes and vision. Preserving vision health is one of our most important thing to do. Omitting eye care and eye exams can result in serious vision damage.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any eye problems using the web browser, to-do apps, calendars, writing messages or checking the phone book or the call log, you should take this test to check if you need eye treatment and/or vision training.\r\n\r\nNight vision improves night vision, it also improves night vision, this visual acuity test improves your visual acuity and your night vision.\r\n\r\n2652e2b6f5",

Ophthalmoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to view the back of the eye, including the macula. If macular degeneration is suspected, a fluorescein angiogram may be performed.

In most cases, the disorder is linked to a recessive gene, a gene that must be inherited from both parents in order to cause the disease.

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",
            "One of the Best scary apps in android..but u guys have to do some new challenges or new maps i mean bigger maps ..like if u got 20/20 money u go outside and u keep playing to get a car to run away or somthing like that"

            "I enjoyed this game but it now very frustrating because it is so hard to win any games. Like ridiculously hard. It never used to be like this. Truly sad as I've put a lot of time and money into this game, it shouldn't be the only way you win is to spend money on power ups.",
            "Great game, beautiful graphics and themes. Fun to play, requires strategy- as you advanced and level up-, it becomes harder- but I love that there's also extra rewards and power up earned as you advanced.",
            "Like the game . But? I know on Android I can not even make a log in for jam city . The app will not open my keyboard so I can type it in my email. Ugh the pain . Please fix on pixel 2 xl running android 11",
            "I like that you can use any unlocked character in the journey levels and switch at any time. However, the events in the game usually do not hold my interest. I would like to see more Hans-related things, such as his alternate outfits for playable characters and his statue for a collectible to go with the other main characters."

I think the same thing will happen on My Talking Tom 2! I love Talking Angela sooooo much! Even though people say there's a man in her eyes, I never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever see the man. Talking Angela is sooooo cute!",
            "So I was playing I noticed a vid that came up on YouTube ig was on the news too so I went to check it out and when I came back at first I didn't believe it then wen I got back I saw that the makeup was off her face and floating in the air. I when back where you download it and then saw the pictures of a man in her eyes. I went to go crash my phone the I heard something in the woods so I looked the doors around my house. Then my sister was asleep and I fall asleep too.",
            "Omg literally I just played this from I year and I was playing and I notice that the app is haunted but I love the cat so what just happened is that I just open the app today and angela eyes were red and It was like someone is there behind her and I just ran that time to show that to my parents and there was no one in the chair but I though that it may be some problem of phone and I told hi angela she told hi I am a devil ,i am a devil,and that time i was very scared and i dont want to keep that",
            "I haven't played this game yet I did this ad before I started and going in the game but I heard it's very creepy and if you zoom into the eye then you can see a manner something then yeah I just look on YouTube and I saw a bunch of pictures I mean and then I see that someone is watching you when you play the game so I'm very scared to start of the game right now so yeah wish me good luck so I won't die okay",
            "I was playing and I noticed that there was something or someone in her eye. I saw some things that looked like an and a couch. I screenshoted the eyes and saw those. I thought it was really creepy. I instantly deleted the game after I discovered the things in the eyes. Kids don't download this game without your parents. I think the person that made the game was the person in the eyes. I rate this 1 star cause I thought it was creepy and uncomfortable having someone just staring at you, thats all"

            "Honestly, I've played this game before, so I got it again, only to be disappointed. Whenever I create (or try to) my viking, it stops at the name and says there is a problem registering my viking. Other people are having this issue, but I will keep the game and see if it's resolved soon. Jumpstart Games, fix your game, please.",
            "It's overall a good game that I can spend my time on, but there are a lot of issues that makes many people frustrated. The infamous Battle Event glitch keeps appearing and it sucks. Also, stop changing the Battle Event rewards for the events. I just want to farm gems without engaging in the event, but it forces me to get candy instead. Events should be, well, an event that gives players an option to engage in it or not. Thawfest was the reason why I kept the game uninstalled for months.",
            "It has been awesome playing this game and I love it !!!!!!! I'm glad that you fixed the wild dragon disappearing thing !! But .....I can't do like ....anything ! Cuz you have to pay money for gems and you can't do anything if you don't have gems ! I'd love it if you made there be less coin spending on the new quests and stuff like that !! Please do !!",
            "This game is great.... except that the chat system is awful (the chat is a tad bit too censored and you could get banned for a simple mistake, even though they don't even tell what you said wrong, they just tell you that you said something wrong), the graphics aren't the best, but not the worst, and the controls (especially for decorating the farm) are kinda terrible. But, I suppose it is somewhat decent if you look past the issues. Also, the teen dragons are very glitchy and broken.",
            "It's a fun game overall, but it's also a Pay-to-Win game. You either have to spend money on memberships or gems to do any of the fun quest, or grind for months. I have a membership account and it gets boring because theres no quests until a big update. You should add daily quest to level up your dragons, or just to do something fun. And I also get constantly get \"Logged Out\" of the game. Please fix that. And the chat is horrible. I can't say Hi or I get muted. But overall, it's a decent game."

The augmented reality overlay of visual impairments is a good concept but is poorly done in this app. Some warped cheap glasses from Walgreens could approximate the app overlay just as easily. The visual impairments overlay doesn't account for glare, low contrast, diminished peripheral field of view from old age or retinitis pigmentosa, or the general static in the gray scotomas. Many of these things occur simultaneously in a visually impaired person's field of view. The app shows only three visual impairments in a misleadingly simple manner in contrast.

Now we go to play and everything has to be bought. She is so upset. There was no mention of a trial period. I was going to buy her some packs as a birthday surprise but if this is the way the company does business I will spend my money elsewhere. I would rate lower than 1 if I could.",

            "I like this game sooooo much because I can cook to barbie, and we can go to the beach, salon, music stage, and we can go to different rooms and we can do different fun activities but only 1 thing I don't like, that is the payment. When I press the other characters, it shows the VIP club and we need to pay for it. Even though, I like this game",
            "Hi, I am Sia. This app is good but the only thing is the vip club. I don't want to spend money on them and there are only 2 characters from which you can play but most of the things are in vip so we can't do very much in this game. I recommend that maybe you should open every thing in this app and make a shop for buying hearts which should be vip. Thank you",
            "The game is awesome and the Anime is also good. also I recommend that this is the best app for barbie lovers, everything is just fine but the only thing that bothers me is that u have to pay to unlock some cool places, characters, features,so umm why don't you just make some of the character and features for free so that the games more interesting and fun!!!!! That's the only reason why I'm rating this game a 4 star's",
            "This game is really fantastic. But I deducted 2 stars because you have unlocked really less things in the house and most of them are of VIP club. And the cost of the VIP club is also really high for a kids game. I hope you get those 2 stars as well, by improving the mistakes I told ⭐⭐. Best of luck for your game. 😊. Best of luck for your game. But it's a nice game. Graphics, Gameplay and the controls are also good.",
            "This game is awesome to play.. I love the games made by budge studios.... Controls are very good. Graphics and sound is also too good. I would have given 5 stars, but I gave 4 only. Just because the reason of VIP CLUB. Please unlock some features for us from VIP club. Because this much rate of VIP club is very high for kids game. I request you. Plz...."

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right now🤷🏻‍♀️. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",
            "Game is great.. expensive if you want to keep up...but it never ever connects for me the 1st time . and it's not my interent it's your server...One time I have to use my interent then I have to use my data..and most times I have to go back and forth 3 or 4 times to see which it will take...and this is every single day a few times a day .it never is the same and takes forever to load when it finally gets working.. but I do love the game!

            "Super fun game! I constantly keep looking for new updates because of how addicting it is! Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

Glitch the game: play in laptop go to watch a video of how to glitch the game of red ball 1234 then bingo done.",
            "Its amazing, it had good gameplay, good looks and its very challenging, fun game, it gets a 5/5 tho i got an idea, in the underground/cave levels there should be shards with random colors, when your underneath them they shake for 1 second then fall, there will be 3 colors, green with a speed od 0.3 pink with a speed of 0.9 and yellow with a speed of 3, and can you add a level maker? That would be so cool!",
            "After having the free version of this game for quite a while, my son asked me to put down the massive $1.99 for the Android TV version of this game so he didn't have to wait to unlock lives. On the NVidia Shield w/ controller, this game is a blast for him. The paid version unlocked tons of fun worlds and levels. It's fun simple game play that reminded me a bit of Mario Brothers to be honest. Simple game play but still fun enough for both of us to enjoy. GREAT for kids!",
            "It is crazy how bad the controls are. I have lost all of my lives (all 5) on one part of one level in the first set of 15 because the controls won't respond to me and I am constantly falling off because I have too much speed for the controls to be able to stop after they finally wake up and realize that there is an input. The controls feel harder to use than how hard it is to herd cats.",
            "Very good game and it is also good for children and elders.......my daughter loves this game and when she feel tired or when she is bored she plays the game and she is very happy....one thing she doesn't like and that is the life issue because there are only five life's so when the hard level come and there were no life's she feel very sad.....now she is in 54 level ( fourth episode ) and her age is 11.......so i request to fix these issue and also if total 5 life's then reduce the timing....."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Great game play! There's always something to do to keep you busy whether it be trying to breed a weekly or monthly dragon, completing clan quests(once you get to that level), or participating in one of the frequent events to win food, coins, dragons, and more! I can honestly say, with maybe a little bit of shame, that I can play this game 6 or more hours a day and not get bored!",
            "I love this game, I've played when I was younger but, now I remember the game and realize that I love it! There are so many adorable dragons! When you need to feed the dragons I just don't want to because they are cute just the way they are, but since the developers thought about that, they added the Fountain of Youth that made things 100x better! I find no problems with the game no glitches, it never kicks me out. Keep up the great work Gameloft! :)",
            "This is one of my favorite games!🤩 But you may wonder why I didn't rate it five and just four instead then..🤔 this why 1. Search bar doesn't work for me when I search up dragon's names 2. I am an active player these days, but when I get dragon eggs, it sometime takes 30 seconds, but then some take 21 hours!!!🥴🥵😵 3. I can't pay for VIP or for more gems, so can you please put more ways to get gems, cause I know how to get them, but can you add a way to get gems faster if your in a rush?",
            "Minus a star because im playing this game on a phone and finding it more difficult to see anything because there are too many icons on the screen. Also when you have an egg go onto where it hatches, if you have that dragon already then there should be some way to delete it without waiting for the hatching, which could be anything up to hrs to days.",
            "It's very frustrating that I am in the middle of a task or battle and I get kicked out of the game and I loose what I have done. Also it takes to long to log in. And must of the time hat I log in i get kicked out immediately. I have complained several times and they suggested that I didn't have enough memory in the device so I bou6a memory card of 120gb . And It improves for like a week, and then when back to the same issue. I play the game to get relax and enjoy not to be frustrated. Help me."

In this game one thing that i don't like is that the sound of the kart during the moving . Except this all the things are vry nice . I enjoy this game while playing. I love this game.",

Or even forces me to use boost energy at the start when I dont even need it! They only give you three gems so you would buy the boost energy but it costs 6 gems!! I tried to end game so that I wouldnt have to buy it with my gems. But then it forces you to use your gems to continue. Level 24.",

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

            "This is a very fun game. It has one big issue though that really drives me crazy. Sometimes I put down a decoration or a statue and it disappears, the one time I went into my game and all my statues were gone! It's mainly just been decorations thats been disappearing now but I work so hard for them and it's gone. Please fix this bug and I will rate this game 5 star again. Over all, this is a very fun game, maybe fix the gauntlet spins to get better prizes, but everything else is great!",
            "Typically a fun and well working game. However, I have struggles when speeding up and watching an ad, after watching it and pressing the x to exit that ad. 6 times out of 10 I will have to exit the app due to the screen greying out and constantly changing to my home screen and the grey screen of the game. When I exit the app and re-enter, I lose the speed up. This does happen occasionally throughout the game but mostly on ads.",
            "The game is, well, decent. It is fun at times; you can train dragons, defend Berk, and unlock powerful additions to your team. The only problem I have with this game is the ads. Oh the ADS. I'm aware you need ads to keep the game running, but it gets so overly excessive. It feels like the Dragon Rider memberships is a pay-to-win system. I feel like if you could remove some things only exclusive to Dragon Riders and make them available to all players, membership or not, I'd say 5 stars.",
            "The game itself is interesting and the goals are challenging enough, the game deserves 4 stars but the customer support is negligible and a total let down. I purchased a bonus pack and did not receive my items, I tried numerous times to contact support via the in game bot and via the developer website to no avail. As a paying member I find this really disappointing. Also the dragon spins tend to just give you useless things and not the collective items.",
            "I love this Game. I've been playing for years ! They keep growing it and improving it and adding to it. My Berk is huge and I have so many dragons. Always new challenges and gauntlets and dragons. They dress it up for the seasons Berkstyle. Plus you can get costumes for your dragons. The babies are adorable. I'll never stop playing. It's good because you can do a little or a lot."

            "I straight up didn't install this app. I've never used it or opened it either but it was taking up lots of my battery (about 1% which is a lot for an app that I have literally never opened). I'm assuming my provider (Verizon, surprise, surprise) downloaded this app automatically during an update to my phone which is fantastic, since I was never alerted of this (read: sarcasm).",
            "Complete Battery Hog. I have to disable the web protection settings or it chews up my battery life in a matter of hours. According to my battery usage stats, Verizon's \"anti-virus scanner\" uses up more battery than Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Mobile Games. On some days, Combined. Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "I have been a subscriber with VERIZON for about 14 yrs. I have been more than satisfied with the cell svc, their products they sell, the support teams, and most of all the protection products they offer. This particular app is of the highest quality out on the market. Can't go wrong with this one!!!",
            "This is trouble some to me I have a 1 in the app window all of the time I do not know what to do of the 1 in the app window need help clearing the 1 in the app window . Cause of this happening to people much in proving is needed to correct the problems with this app here????? Unknown if app window problem location/link & intternet problem double check from your end.",
            "Since the app was installed i cannot access my printer to print emails from my phone. This app sucks. I originally thought it was my printer now I am finding out it is my phone. I have been a Verizon customer for years. I am considering a switch to another company."

            "I love games that challenge me and having fun while doing it cant get any better. The only thing I would like to really see them change in the game is being able to sale or discard the build up of all the unusable items that's wracked up during the game when we have to play boards again and again to get the full in items to complete a collection. It's a waste of space and gets ugly seeing all those collections needing to be filled but it's one's you've filled again and again going no where.",
            "I like most of this game to pass the time, but honestly the gem match portion is ridiculous. If you are going to require it to get certain elements at least make it possible. The mechanics are absurdly clunky and slow and the colors make it difficult to see the blues and greens. Please consider updating, it is ruining the rest of the game. The hidden object and other puzzles are good.",
            "The game is good, but the friends part is poorly organized and difficult. Gifting collection items is so difficult, it's almost no fun to do. Collectibles should be organized by quantity. I only gift items that I have more than one of. Having to scroll through EVERYTHING to find my multiples takes FOREVER. No fun!",
            "Been playing this game for over 5 years. I don't play it all the time so I do save up a lot of energy to play special events, that's what I play the most. I just get frustrated now always having to play gem match as that is my least favorite puzzle. Please consider switching them up like you used to. Also it would be nice if you could accept all gifts at once from friends like before the friends section changed to what it is now. Also having the option to block invites would be appreciated.",
            "I love this game but a couple improvements could be made like when you visit another player's game you have to go back home before you can visit another 1. There should be a way to go from 1 player's game to another right from where you are. Unless there already is & I just can't find it. Also the match 3 moves like molasses & I feel that I've lost just becoz of that & the fact that you can't do anything until all the pieces have come to a full stop. That's a little unfair I think."

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",
            "Hello SQ. I just want to let you know that this is the best game I have ever played but I am expierencing some problems. Whenever I am going to my state (Kabar) it always loses connection for some reason when I have a good connection. Please fix. Edit: the problem is now fixed thank you so much.",
            "Very good game and challenging so that you will never be bored except that the special event number of days is too small and that you won't have enough material, other than that it's good, also what are the chances of getting the jackpot at the stock exchange when you are level 70"

We’re very excited about the improvements we made to the game, hope you’ll be, too!<br>Needless to say, some bugs were squashed so you could have a better gaming experience.<br>As every week, we have new chapters coming out so time to start reading your favorite stories!<br>Install and enjoy yourself!",
        "comments": [
            "The game is fun and addicting, I just wish the choices didn't cost so much, I realize money has to be made, but it would be nice if there was an option to get more than 10 a day for a VIP pass. UPDATE: I still enjoy the game, however it would be nice if once you played through a story, you didn't have to use tickets to go through it again or use more gems to get hairstyles or clothes or pick choices you already made.",
            "I liked the stories but it gets expensive very quickly (I could buy several books with the costs) and you can't change the gender of your character. It was set to female and that was my only choice. The ad I clicked on showed a gay storyline but none of the story choices were that type. I'm a little confused. I also purchased the vip package but saw no benefit from it. Not really sure what I paid for. Still spent a ton on gems, had to buy outfits, hairstyles, experiences, and keys.",
            "Now don't get me wrong the storylines are awesome,they're steamyinteractive but the price of the gems are ridiculous! Now I've downloaded this game I've given it at least a week before I made a judgment on it to actually post a review but it's ridiculous the amount of money that needs to be spent in order to have a good choice or a good ending........ So it keeps the reader interested, it is too much money I understand that you guys need money to keep the game running but it shouldn't be THIS",
            "I love the storyline but like others have said, it's hard to get diamonds. It gives you options but you can't afford the premium options. I think you should be awarded more than 1 diamond for reading a 10-15 minute story. I would love to finish but I'm afraid I may have to uninstall this because at the rate I'm going, I will not get finished. Plus when you click to try to speed up or add diamonds, the game locks up and you lose where you were and you don't get rewarded.",
            "So far I love this app but gems are very useful and I have barely enough for anything. And the fact that you have to buy clothes that you already have. So gems need a big upgrade like come on it really needs it. I love the story that I am in and I think that's it the best but it judges you if your clothes aren't good enough 😕 and some of the best things cost so much gems its unbelievable. So I am on Lessons on Lust or something and I wanted to do the threesome with Gemma but its costs to much."

            "I love this little game. Its fun, fast paced as you want it to be, just challenging enough to be enjoyable. The graphics are super cute. I would definitely recommend to a friend! Super fun! Played 50 rounds the first day. Sound effects a cross between Goofy and The Rock. Good for what ails you if you are (like me) about to barf from all the politics stuff!! Try it; YOU WILL LIKE IT!!",
            "I really enjoy this game. It has zero annoying ads. You do have an ad opportunity, but you gain something from watching it and it's not forced on you. Now that's how ads should be. The game is a good diversion without becoming frustrating. Update 10/23/20 - All morning, I've been getting \"You must connect to server\" messages. I'm already connected. If I go to the chat and back, it connects. This is a nuisance. I often can't gain credit for the tournament points I've earned.",
            "I have been playing this game for well over a year now. Almost to level 1500. I have NEVER spent one cent. Yes some levels are harder and it takes multiple times to beat it. But they are all beatable. It doesnt have constant ads or pressures to buy extra stuff. If you want it to be easy and spend your money by all means go ahead. Or just be patient and its free to all. Great job guys!! 5 stars!!",
            "I've enjoyed the game so far. I like that there are easier levels and more challenging ones. I also love the unlimited life time that gets handed out, but I do have a suggestion. Why not make that bankable like coins and the boosters? I can't always play for an hour or more, but I don't want the unlimited lives to go to waste just because it's not a good time to play. It would be great to be able to select an increment of time for unlimited lives from your bank. Otherwise, great game.",
            "LOVE THE GAME! However, after the latest update the app becomes soooo laggy. From splash screen to the home screen takes almost 10 minutes. Sometimes when you move to the next level it takes almost 3 minutes to play again. I hope the devs will fix it asap. This is the only game app that love so much."

            "The game was quite boring because as shown in the figure all the fairy , mermaid and superhero packs is not opened to open it you have to purchase it . There was only the normal princess dressup with only three types of dresses unlocked only with different colors . So do not be attracted by the figures shown there . That is the reason why I am giving it only 2 stars . So don't waste your time by installing this game .",
            "This game is amazing!! All you have to do to get everything is press the Unlock Everything button and BOOM!!!!! You get to be anything!!!! You can be a princess,a fairy,a mermaid,and even a unicorn!!!! Thanks Mattel!!!!",
            "I think this game was cool until I had to buy the mermaid, unicorn and fairy package!!! I mean seriously!? And why pay for supersuits that come in the normal human princess package??? Are people just supposed to hand out their money to Budge just because they would like to keep playing this game?! I thought Budge made minor improvments to this game, ... BTW, WE ARE STILL PAYING FOR MOST OF THESE THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!🙅😱😦 And the ads...OMG the ads are so annoying!!! Couldn't there be just two ads",
            "It's nice just mabey if we only had to buy 1 or 2 of the packs like superhero and unicorn pace because I really want to make a fary mermaid. I am also asking for this because I am not allowed to spend out of game money for this. Or to get the packs u earn 1 or 2 tokens for each Barbie and when u get enough u can buy the other packs.",
            "I love the game ,I tryied my very best to unlocke the mermaid,some dolls, unicorn doll, the unicorn outfit,the mermaid outfit and the Fairy princess outfit. But are you crazy why would I pay for it.No ads well that's good. Better fix this problem.😤😡😠Thank you."

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",

I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

Edit: the game has never been glitchy, but recently I was playing and suddenly the game got stuck and my phone turned off after that, the music if the game was still playing and my phone wouldn't turn on for a while. The problem is fixed now, but I'm still worried about entering the game. Does the game have a glitch or a virus?",

But in all the consept of the game is child friendly but not whith 2 yr olds. Dose anyone else think its wired that you can be a HUMAN!? And no I can't hold my breath for more than 15 seconds thank you very much. I just realized this got random. Well have an awesome day! 'Put a bannana in your ear ' - Jason Steel",

            "Last update on Google play was sept 16, and today Oct 10 I am told my app is out of date. This is a security app, not tetris. Also, won't start automatically after restart sometimes. I have to manually start it (if I notice it's not running).",
            "Hello, my phone has been spammed. I thought this app is supposed to protect against that. Now I don't know how to stop the spamming. I keep getting messages that my phone will be locked if I don't install and pay for Spam protection.",
            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",
            "Still kinda on the fence with this app since switching over from a very corrupt AT&T. I can say that because I've been with them for over 20 years. They went bad about 4 years ago. Thank you Verizon.",
            "App doesn't allow Web security. You turn on 2 seconds later the app crashes I have no idea if I'm safe browsing on the Web > latest version 9/16 Issue still a problem !!!"

            "Simply impressed !! You guys out did yourselves, fantasic storyline with a dark undertone. Beautiful and haunting music, coupled with detailed and beautiful artwork. Loved the backstory and graphics, including the CGI animation. Good work on how the evidence board was compiled to move the story along with the prisoner, nothing was boring. Nice puzzles and hidden object scenes. Had fun, keep'em coming.",

            "I find that sometimes there are technical problems such as the the screen being pixelated(like a television screen type of pixalation) or the app itself not working/crashing without reason (I already checked my internet provider and it seems like it wasn't the source of the problem). I hope such issues would be resolved in the future. The design of the app is very neat and clean. Also, It's great that you've put your policies in the display.",
            "Better than YouTube? Yes. Dailymotion has alot of content, movies to watch, a very clean interface and more up to date sleek channel design look, easy to browse, search filters for searching for videos. There are things which i would like to see for Desktop and Mobile. Dailymotion needs a night mode, the explore page needs a gaming and tech section, search filters needs to have more filters, bring back the thumb's up feature, the browse more section has too much sex and nudity kissing nonsense , that has nothing to do with what you're watching. Great site, but needs more features, but i do recommend Dailymotion over YouTube.",
            "Giving this a 5 stat just because google reeeeeally wants me to delete the app. Whenever I get a notification about deleting apps to make room daily motion is always near the top of the list, despite the fact there are apps I haven't used in almost a year near the bottom. It seems if it's not owned by a big tech corporation Google thinks it's a waste of space on my phone. Couldn't possibly be that google doesn't like a YouTube competator being on my phone.",
            "This actually regards the Smart TV app. It's horrible, logging me out often & we all know how tedious TV \"keyboards\" are for text entry. I have externally created playlists that do nothing. I can move to each playlist but clicking on it doesn't open it so all playlists are unplayable. Often, recommended videos start playing their audio stream in the background & can't be stopped. Other videos can't be played because unwanted, unstoppable content is already playing. Better 2 cast from Android app",
            "Some, if not most of the videos require following a link to sign up with details. Its hard to find series that you can just watch direct. Plus not all seasons and episodes are available. But as im persistent I take my time to click many videos before I find a link free episode, then enjoy that, but it can be time consuming. Glad it's free tho!"

            "The stories are really good, and the charater designs look nice. The only thing is I wish there were no gem choices. It makes it hard to play the game the way you want, and the only way to get them is from reading chapters or ads. I can eventually get enough for some choices but it takes a while. The VIP subscription is really expensive too. Still, it's a good game with no pop up ads, And therr are a lot of different stories of many genres to choose from!",
            "Everything about this game is great — the stories, the characters, the graphics, the music. But I am giving it two stars because the pricing model is terrible. Each chapter of each book typically contains three premium choices which tend to cost 15+ \"diamonds\" each. The only effective way to get diamonds is to spend actual cash — even if you pay the $15 a month for VIP, you get only 10 additional diamonds a day. VIPs don't even get a discount on diamond packages. Sad.",
            "I love this game, but the only problem is when it comes to keys and gems. When you don't wanna pay for these things you end up having to wait FOREVER for them to re-gen. I see a way to fix this as being able to re-gen 5 keys instead of just 2, or make the keys re-gen faster. For the gems maybe they could give out 5 gems every 12 or so hours instead of 24. Overall the game is great, and these are the only problems I have with it.",
            "It is a fun game just costs too much to be able to make the good choices. Should have more options available at least for the closet without having to use so many. Should be more ways to get more free diamonds or make the choices with having to use less of them. There should be way more options to get way more diamonds especially for VIPs. But no there isn't. Everything costs. Or you have to wait forever to build up enough diamonds to even finish a chapter. Not right.",
            "This game is addictive. I loved it very much but the Graphics are blurry when it comes to the real part of love making. The developers should work on it and make the conversation more lengthy and seductive instead of going directly to love making. Moreover, the sound effects and music needs improvement by adding moaning, crying and laughing and ecstasy sounds to the game so that one should feel he/she is actually itself a character and not a spectator. 18 plus version is also needs to be added."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

I am very nervous and wondering. What did I get my self into?",

            "Lag, slow loading and high prices, this game lags so bad that sometimes I can't even chat, the timer should not run during loading in a raid. Sometimes it takes 3-4 minutes to load a fight and I lose my raid because it takes so long to load. Startup takes 7-8 minutes The shop items are expensive for what you get for your money. No bonus items really for spending more. Most games the more money you spend the more you get in bonuses. Not this game. If my husband didn't play I would quit.",
            "The game as a whole is good even though there are countless hackers threatening to destroy it if their demands are not met but regardless the game as a hole is glorious as it stands and should not be tampered with under any circumstance unless it is by the developer and the only reason why it would ever be considered hard is because a bunch of morons ruined it by hacking.",
            "My favorite game but I have 2 problems: 1) I bought a mobile with 90Hz display and the game doesn't support it. 2) Very often I get the error message \"Problem connecting to network\". Only the game didn't respond. The other apps like Chrome, Facebook etc which needs internet connection works flawlessly.",
            "Most of the people playing this game say that it's slow. I can assure you that it isn't, their internet just must not be that great and playing the game on tablet or bluestacks is probably a better option than a tiny phone trying to render the game. The story is meh, but the game barely focuses on it. You also should care more about upgrading your characters because sooner or later you are going to be weak fighting insanely hard robots due to the game assuming you want to grind or jump and die.",
            "I love this game, but the data consumption is much. I would like this game better if you add more characters like Bulkhead, Alpha Trion, Micronus Prime, and other primes, Steel Jaw, Strongarm, Fallen, Blurr, Polarclaw, Crasher, Octopunch, Crazybolt, Shadelock, Clawtrap, Glacius, Hammer, and other Minicons like Fixit, Jetstorm, Slipstream, Aerobolt, Ransack, etc. The game would be more interesting with more challenging modes. I hope you will read these suggestions I have made."

            "The app is one of the best apps out there but the update has not been great at all. It does not give you an option of the voice you really prefer to listen to. At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

            "It's really frustrating to look at the dial that tracks your fertility. Sometimes I want to look ahead to see when it will be at its peak or I know my husband and I got frisky on a certain day and I want to see what the likelihood of getting pregnant was. Also, now that I am pregnant (clearly the likelihood was pretty high) it would be great if I could pause the cycle tracking. I know there's another app for tracking pregnancy, but it would be great to not have a 9 month period cycle on Eve.",
            "I changed to Eve because I was using Glow just to track my period these days but I'm a bit disappointed. The app looks nice icons and layout but it's a bit confusing (like where do I find my daily logs?!) and I feel like Eve is 80% locked unless you are a premium user 🥲",
            "I only use it to track my period/what cycle day I'm on and I've never had an issue with that part. What I would like to see an improvement in: 1.) Less gendered language throughout the app. Not everyone who has a period is a woman and/or likes being referred to as \"lady\" or \"girl\". 2.) Cut out the patronising, outdated and frankly gimmicky comments about my cycle. I would much rather have an informative, comprehensive look at it, which takes into account that not everyone is the same.",
            "Sadly none of the moods and symptoms I logged in Glow apps is available in this app. Would consider switching, but don't want to loose all the data.",
            "I use to really like this app. You could log everything and see all your stats. Now you have to pay to get most of that. Also the community use to be very supportive. Now it's negativity, hate, and women tearing women or men down. After seeing racism was accepted on this app I will now be deleting the app and won't be returning."

            "I have played this game for 6 years now (even though I have had to start from the start again due to getting a new device) and I think it's just a great game over all it's always got something new for you and it never gets repetitive! (Oh and Logi Bear I read your review and that's a problem with the device not the game)",
            "10/10 my phone isn't the greatest and even with such high graphics and quality it is lag free. Almost no ads, the pay is amazing, and there is an equal balance of easy quests and hard quests. (T-Rex is no joke. That thing is tough.) Overall great game. Used to play it a lot on my iPad a few years ago. I'm biased a bit cause of nostalgia lol.",
            "My experience with this company is misery, i personally have had over £40.00 in credits to which i have been passed from Google play store and the game builder time after time. I'm writing this review to tell others what sort of company this is, it is a good game but as for the after service that SUCKS! I have told every gamer i know to boycott this company for your future peace of mind, do the same these people need to be taught not to steal other people's money, thank you for your ears!....",
            "This game was the best game, but the energy thing is very bad you just have to waste 1 or 2 hours, and sometimes one day, and also it says that you can upgrade your weapon but then when you press the button to upgrade it just says ( PURCHASED ) and then i just have to watch those time wasting ads and it then even purchases 100 of my money seriously. Thought it is the and sometimes you shoot the dinosaur and it just shoots but doesn't damage and the dino just runs by it self . But the best game !",
            "It is a very good game, but the energy thing is pretty stupid, that and all the guns almost cost good and there is pretty much no way to get gold, other than that though great game! Would definitely recommend this to a friend!"

            "The app is good, with a medium learning curve. I found I needed to make about 10 plans before I got comfortable with it. It is limited with certain structures - there is no possibility to add a balcony or terrace! I have had to workaround this limitation by creating a room with a wall of 1cm. The worst part is trying to create a special room where the walls are not fitting the 3 general structures presented. It is a complete headache and a mess trying to split a wall. I succeeded by luck so far",
            "This app is awesome. I love that you can quickly lay out a floor plan and then tour it in 3D to see how it feels. I like that they continue to add new furniture and stuff, I hope they keep it up. The one thing that I don't like, is that is difficult to make roofs. I wish they would make it so you can slope walls so you can put windows in the gable ends. Right now I just use the boxes and use the sloping feature, but that is pretty difficult. Other than that, this app is amazing.",
            "The best floor plan creator on Android. Making your plans with this app will definitely save your architect a lot of trouble in picturing how you would prefer almost every single details and layout of your intended house. It might be a bit complicated at first but if you fiddle around with it you will get the hang of it plus you will realize it's power to do exactly what it's name says. Too bad the Pro version isn't can't be bought from the country I'm at. Well done team 👍💓",
            "I'm really enjoying this app! We are in the process of planning our house and this is what I was looking for. The ads are out of the way and I can continue to design without stopping to close them. I love the 3D view. It would be nice if the undo button was first or second on the bar instead of having to swipe to find it. It would also be really helpful to be able to submit a question. I gave it 4 stars only because I don't know how the print option is yet. This app is really so fun.",
            "Amazing for making simple or even complex floor plan. A lot of the negative reviews are about not being able to export or screenshot, so if thats what you want, you need to purchase the app. But 6.99 is a lot better than AutoCads $10 a month. The only suggestion I can make is the ability to create your own furniture, as it would have been helpful when moving around set pieces. Either way, amazing for a free app."

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",

            "This app is likely just meant to be a delivery system for ads. I put up my TV Mount and it was so off level, it would be funny if I hadn't just spent a ton of time on it. After I borrowed a real level, it was easily 3 degrees off level, which is insane. Don't waste your time with this app. I used it without my case on an Pixel 4 Xl with location services turned on and the whole shebang. Avoid using.",
            "With a 10.3 inch tablet, it really shines. Anyone complaining about accuracy, maybe it's your phone/tablet's accuracy. Also, like a real level, the longer the baseline (length) the higher the accuracy.",
            "Quickest rating of given. I haven't had this app for a full five minutes yet, and think it's awesome! Stay full-time in a 36' travel trailer, and literally lay my phone on the counter and adjust the trailer to feel extremely level. GREAT APP, so far. I will probably upgrade if the price is fair.",

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

            "This game is filled with ads every few seconds, which is understandable to a point, it's free, but those ads should be appropriate for the target audience of the game. Multiple ads have come up that advertise the keto diet and explain that if you don't go on it your partner will hate you, or that your appearance is the only thing that matters. Others advertise animated characters and zoom in inappropriately on their crotch. This is unacceptable for a children's game!",
            "Angela is adorable! She has cute fashion sense and I've always thought this game is full of good vibes. The mini games are also pretty fun! Just a heads up, there's a lot of ads in this game, but I'm glad the more inappropriate ones don't appear anymore for the sake of its intended audience. To the devs: Minor note as if writing this, her hair in her Halloween outfit sometimes glitches in her sleep.",
            "Great but there's a few glitches. Like the puzzle game. Blocks get stuck at the top half of the screen and you can't move them. The sky high game - you can't get higher that 10 points even if you got all perfects/ even if you watched an ad to keep going. Makeup that you (in game) buy gets removed if you dance with the blue stars and earn temporary makeup. After a day, Once the temporary makeup ends, the other makeup gets removed even if you didn't use the temporary makeup. Pls fix ♥️",
            "This game is very good,relaxable,enjoyable and many good things about this game I love this game so much ,,,but Can you please fix the bugs. When l go to store to buy sticker for watch ad (data off) and when l turn on the data it will show that 20 diamonds. I RECOMMOND THE INSTALLERS THAT PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS FOR ENJOY, EXICTMENT, RELAX AND FEEL GOOD",
            "This game is very good there is one problem reason for 4 stars. Every time I went out and went back in then it kept on saying go to the previous game or start a new game then every time I went to the previous game it made me start everything overeverything like the sleeping and they're eating and applying and the dancing went to 0%"

            "I've used aldiko for years, but will now be looking for a different app. Stupid ads make it unusable. When you open the app, it now opens to an ad that won't go away. There's no way to go back or X out of it, it's just stuck there. It's a shame. What once was a good solid app is now garbage..",
            "I've had aldico premium for years and loved it. Recently I moved hundreds of ebooks to the SD card on my Samsung Galaxy tablet and now I cannot get the aldiko reader to open any of those books. I've spent hours on the internet trying to find how and I'll have to change readers if you can't resolve this for me. Thank you. Blue",
            "Come on guys. Love the app, but all the adds recently. Mostly the ones that pop up when the app starts and won't let me pass, making the app unusable. No cross to close the add, clicking on the add doesn't work either, not does pressing the back button. Forcibly closing the app and restarting just shows the same add again...",
            "I would give it a 5 star if it had a search option. since some books do not have a cover, its hard to get a book unless you search it through other mean and then choose to open with Aldiko in which case it tells you that the book has already been added. I hate that but otherwise it is a superb app",
            "Tried creating a note. It took me to the subscription screen, but there is no alternative pricing. Only monthly. Forget it."

            "There is no doubt that the Muslim Pro App is a fantastic application and it is the best of its type. I consult it every day as it is very useful to me in communicating with my Creator. May Allah reward the Developers adequately, Aameen. However I wish to inform you that whenever an update is received, downloaded and installed on the Muslim Pro App, all information on the Birthday section on the Calendar is wiped out. Please what can be done to keep the information intact.",
            "Very good app, however i preferred the previous version's method of marking verses as read. Now I have to click the three dots to mark each verse as read and to save progress. Very tedious for each verse. Edit: They have not changed the Quran system and did not even respond to my email regarding this issue. Very unprofessional and arrogant.",
            "My lifetime premium version had worked very well so far but today It does not work at all on my huawei P30 Pro. Last android update. Please help. In addition, app on huawei app gallery canot be upgraded to premium version.. I will re-rate once I fixed. .................................................. Updated on 21 October 2020, it is working good right now.",
            "Alhamdulillah The Muslim Pro app is always reliable, and accurate. It is an excellent reminder to read the Qur'an, and have inspiration. Also there are plenty of ways within the app to connect to the community and now with the virtual Hajj journey it is a blessing. It also helps me with being on time, having the Adhan play for the obligatory prayers. Signing up for the lifetime membership is a sure way to always be connected.",

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "Had a problem with subscription features that as far as I know, cleared itself up (no support, clearing the cache didn't work. Did that, uninstalled and reinstalled and ensured I was logged into the correct account. Gave up, came back to the app a day later and was able to use HD features and all filters). It took a little less than support to respond, so that was good considering this is an app where you shouldn't run into many issues. Only issue, reorganizing your filter collection is a pain",
            "Used to be good but the quality fell, the filters aren't as good as they used to be, it is slow, and it suddenly became a subscription thing. There are very few filters, and the advert for the subscription or the free day trial keeps popping up every other moment. The few free filters are low quality and there doesn't appear to be many locked ones, so doesn't seem worth the money. Am very disappointed.",
            "The photo styles are great and I like that there is a choice of SD or HD, and that a variety of settings can be modified with the ease of a slider, however, the styles themselves are limited and there doesn't appear to be a way to include more (either as a freebie or paid). As much as I'm enjoying it, I don't see myself using it even the full year with that limitation. I'm on the fence as to whether it's worth the yearly cost. I have photoshop on my desktop; I'd be better off with that.",
            "amazing array of effects. totally engaging. few options that I wish were there: 1. search or filter effects based on criteria. Considering there are so many effects, searching through them to find the right one is time consuming. I wish they were sorted in categories or even better had a search option with facility t filter search results . 2. compare effects / compare with original option.",
            "Great app only problem is I used to be able to isolate a person and take the filter off only on the person or have the filter only on the person and the everything else normal. I really liked this feature and idk if it got removed or if it was moved and I can't find it."

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

It also provides information about why a verse was revealed. It compiles almost all the work done by top scholars in one place and it is very easy to navigate. I highly recommend this app. Great effort has been invested in this project. Jazakom Allah khyran.",

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

            "Enjoying playing the game. It's so addicting I'm going to have to set a timer. I really like the game but I continually get a network error then the game reloads. With the help of Emma's Adventures tech I no longer have problems. I unplugged my router for about three minutes then plugged it back in. After getting back online, everything is running smoothly. In the future, I'll unplug and see if thar fixes the problem before driving the tech crazy with all my messages to them for help.",
            "I like the challenges and how you build up your town the way you want it . I have been playing this game for a while now and still like it but 2 major issues . The ships that come in you should have the same option as the train to let it go even if you haven't filled it . The guild is not great most of the time its too hard to help people compared to other games such as township in that game being part of a guild is what makes the game fantastic. a few changes would make it fun and enjoyable.",
            "So far the best game I have played from play store. I have not spent any money. I am level 53. They always add more content to keep playing. Not everyone will like this game because we are all different. Most people will find it just fine. It is not a pay to play game but if you like it...you can support the developers by buying things if you wish to. I have received no compensation for this review nor do I want it. This is a great game!",
            "Very slow. Not able to advance as quick as I would like to. Stuck on home, going around the crops and animals, since started. Unable to go to other areas without getting stuck. !!!!! Has improved a lot. / Hate it when it goes off while playing at a good moment..... One problem is as I am working on this game, it switches off. So frustrating 😡 . How long will I have to put up with this?",
            "I really like this game but the further you progress in the game, the more energy points it takes to do anything. You spend all your time filling orders just to kill time until you have enough energy to actually play the levels. And then you only have enough energy to clear a bush or two and then wait for an hour. Clear a bush, wait an hour. It becomes far too tedious to want to continue."

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

            "Sometimes app do not sync with watch. I need my data back. I use to do 10-15K for Oct 2020. All of a sudden I could not see 10k being tracked. I could not contact customer service as there seems to be no hotline or whatsapp help. Example: I was about 7500steps until 11.30pm and I ran 2.36kms which is more than 3000 steps for sure and that did not sync to health app. This is totally frustrating.looks like a bug. I need it to be fixed. Calories also did not sync properly.",
            "Not much user friendly to use, Bluetooth does not auto connect, it does not shows in scan,device name is not shown in bluetooth scan list but still it connect ,I guess that's a bug to be solved,Cannot see data in app offline you need to manually connect even if its paired .App does not open offline.Most of the Honor watch ES features are not shown in app,require to update features,Need lot of improvement as compared to other Health apps.After that it can be eligible for 5 star rating",
            "I would really appreciate an easy way to export the data in a standard file format like csv or xml or gpx in case of tracks. Transfer of tracks from the GT2 watch to this app is very scetchy. The watch appears to register gps signals ok but only a small part of these data gdts transferred to the app. As many others i would like to be able to deselect step counting devices e.g. when carryimg both a watch and a phone. What is really ennoying is that max heart rate is consistently reset to 190",
            "Very Poor app and watch experience coming from Garmin. I REALLY regret going backwards to Huewel. I now have my time wasted to sell and migrate back, the watch features could be good, if you could export data to a useable app I would probably still keep the system. Happy with the way the watch looks like overall EXTREMELY DISSAPPONTED about everything else. UPDATE I've now bought a Garmin and once it arrives life will soon be good again",
            "Still there's no option to chose the source of step count, the app automatically merges data from phone and the band. This is extremely inaccurate! Tons of people complain about this missing feature for YEARS! This could be fixed easily, yet Huawei still don't care about the feedback of their customers. Shame on you! Guess what? Never gonna spend money on Huawei products because of 0 customer support."

I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",

They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

Spend the first with the most spook-tacular dragons of Dragonia, then let the second whisk you away on a romantic adventure - plus, don’t miss the chance to collect these ultra-unique items and creatures!",
        "comments": [
            "Fun game. If there are ads, I never noticed them... completely unobtrusive. And you can literally play for years without spending a penny of real money. The only downsides for me was the ultimate boredom in trying to get the last few spaces on the board, it takes too long. And the weekend events, while giving great rewards, will take nearly every minute of your weekend days to complete. I finally gave up trying to finish the game and uninstalled, but I would recommend giving it a go.",
            "I really enjoy playing the game (only reason why I gave 3 stars), however it keeps coming out of the game and forgetting my progress. Also, things get expensive the further in you go, and I've only been playing it for less than a week! Today by forgetting my progress, it lost me some treasures I would have used to get dragon eggs, which is the only way to advance the game. Ads take me out of the game. Ultimately I'm frustrated with the game and am considering finding something else 😬😒☹️😡😟",
            "The camp economy needs redone. I have to pay gems for everything I work for, and what I receive is not valuable. I opened a level 5 chest, and only received 145 coins and nothing else. The two stars are only there because of the memories when I played this years ago. I know you guys can improve. I don't want to have to switch to a different merge game. P.S. Accidents are fatal. For example, when you're going for a high level item and then merging 3 objects instead of 5.",
            "Such a great game! Graphics are amazing and it's great puzzling fun. One suggestion I have is to make a lock or pinned feature for objects, so they're not as easy to move around if you don't want them to. I also suggest some kind of warning or countdown for when the special events are ending. I like to collect everything at the end, and I tend to lose track of time. I didn't get anything I worked hard for for three days... so annoyed, and it's my own fault but wow. A little notice would be nice",
            "This is a good game to sink time into when nothing else is going on. What I don't like is that purple stars are imposible to get unless you spend real money. I haven't had a purple star drop in more than two months... And I can't justify the cost to buy the gems with real money. It would be nice to have a trade option to purchase the gems with things earned through game play. I'm stuck on some quests because of this \"feature.\""

            "This game has improved a lot. It's a very fun game to play. However halfway through the game it started to freeze everytime the boat came home. I thought the game would be saved in my account so I deleted and reinstalled it. Wasn't saved and I lost all my progress. Is there any way to restore the game without losing my progress. If not I guess it was fun while it lasted. I have spent too much money on this game. Read the other reviews. Either fix the game or I think it should be red tagged.",
            "Can't play the whirlpool game without it kicking me off the game altogether and can't return to the home island without it freezing every single time I'm just so glad I haven't spent any money on this ridiculous game, these bugs need fixing or this game will loose a lot of players and the reviews will just keep getting worse and worse.",
            "The game is now cheating you out of your daily challenge rewards. It will not let you claim your reward. It says claim later and retry. But, you cannot claim it later. This is the 2nd time this has happened! Last time it stayed that way for awhile & when it finally was fixed for daily challenge it did not give you your reward to claim & began again with the same challenge at zero. Also, you have to close out & restart the game every time you go back home. It freezes everytime!! Stuck 2days now!",
            "DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! After many glitches, freezing and shut downs I contacted customer service for help. They responded with a list of things to try, which I followed with no luck. The final thing they said to do was to log in through FB or Google (which I did) uninstall and reinstall to see if it fixed itself. Before I did that I sent a 2nd email asking again for another solution - was worried I'd lose my progress, but got no response. So I uninstalled, and yup, lost it all! Just don't!!!",
            "I used to love this game with its exploring, rescueing animals, the new land when you ride off to limited places to collect items and find new animals, the mini games are fun too or where. Everytime I do the scatlantian mini game it loads to 99% then shuts the game, how is this fun or fair since on top of it it's a limited time event, now also when I explore lands and return home it gets to the edge of land and before Manny, Sid and Diego can get off the boat it shut shuts down the game too"

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You 👌👍💙",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "I bought the oppo watch. I am upset with Google fit on the Wrar OS by Google. Google fit has a lot of issues with background mode. It can lose steps and heart tate. The standart HeyYap health app works fine on the watch. It collects steps and heart rate correctly. Unfortunately, it only can synchronize sleep tracking data to Google fit. For example, I had very long walking on 28th October. There are only 5624 steps in the Google fit, but 22352 steps are in the HeyTap. I have more the same issues",
            "This app used to work great for a number of years, but has become progressively worse and now, over the last year, almost useless. Now it can barely track anything in the background and fails to calculate calories. It seems to record steps but never seems to log them as calories spent, or as activities such as walks or bike rides. It generally just fails at being a fitness app and misses the majority of a day's activity. I've spent the last few months entering activities manually. Useless.",
            "Perfect app tht I use as a widget on my home screen. I religiously update any recordings I take offline and is a kind of my health journal, that I can review and make some assessment. I had seen great pointers that helped me to predict something going wrong and seek timely medical help. I helps you to be more disciplined. I also see feel a drawback, why doesn't it allow me to record my sugar levels. I believe the bp, sugar , weight & distance are inter-relateable for comprehensive fitness view",
            "I've taken up the Dubai Fitness Challenge this year ( today being the 1st day) and to keep up with the challenge, I use the Fastrack Reflex app to calculate my daily steps while I go for my walks/runs. But the problem in this, is that the the sync option doesn't seem to be working. The reflex app shows that its been connected to Google Fit, but when I check Google Fit, it shows me 0 steps, whereas the reflex band shows I've completed 6000+ steps. What could be the issue?"

            "I enjoy the ability to listen to a book as I drive, the only to toddler-free time I have. I love the book exchange, so I can keep the books I truly love. It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "I really like it. It has a fun storyline, nice decor choices and overall a nice game. Its addictive and its cute. The cats are adorable and I love how you meet new ones as the story goes on. I really do like the idea of having a cat area built just for the cats and how people can come visit and like it. It's a fun, cute and addictive game and I really enjoy it.",
            "I love the challenge! It surprised me that Kitten Match isn't a game geared for children. The levels start out easy but they get challenging as you win and move up to higher levels. The story line is adorable and there are many different facets in the game. It's kept me interested and actually looking forward to play it and help the kittens with a variety of tasks. Try it... you'll like it too!",
            "Although this is one of my fave games which I only started playing in the last week and the story with the kittens is really adorable they just make it too freaking hard if you have no boosters to get through a level. Can't buy anything on this phone as I use my graphics handle so I'm like stuck and have no way to get any boosters when I really need them. I'm just devastated because I really really love the story and the renovation aspect of this game.",
            "This is a fun game. I'm not a mad fan of matching games but this one plays fair. Rewards are generous, there is no constant stream of ads and decorating is fun. Not does it cheat - if you have to use coins to extend a game you usually only have to do it once. Graphics are good and the cats are cute. I like it.",
            "Love playing the game. Love the cats and their costumes. The ads are not annoying. Just wish that when you play multiple boards that your bombs, ball etc. Would be able to go to next board. Also wish that it was easier to get rewards, some puzzles need more moves or if at the end of no more moves that if there are balls, bombs, line cleaners etc, that they could do a last blast. I am looking forward for the next update ."

            "This is supposed to be fun, not frustrating or leaving you feeling like you've been ripped off. The new update has changed the payouts on all the games of chance. Even if you get a \"special casino night\" it's a major rip-off. I started out with over 260 diamonds on my \"special\" hour and it took all of my money and my diamonds. I've already decided the \"Star Club\" aint worth it (tried it) The game isn't much fun unless you have diamonds-too expensive -my advice is PASS!! My id is Qpydz542.",
            "I love the game there are no ads in it. You can dress up style yourself your two bff will help you in this journey. Meet many people in the game u can even invite your friends to play with you. But there is 1 thing that I don't like in it that all the things are very expensive gems r less but give amazing dresses that which has to change and there are only 3 eye ball colours and eye shadow colours. Over all it is a lovely and amazing game u should try the game once in your life. 😍😇😁😁",
            "I like it, it's a fun game. I think the price of the clothing cost way to many diamonds, and not enough of them cost cash, mostly everything cost diamonds. And you don't get many with purchase unless you make a large purchase. And the up scale clothing stores should give gift bags. And why do I have to pay for a date? Haha.",
            "I want to take the time to express my thoughts on this very very cool game! I believe that while I am a star member there is really no benefit to it. $19.95 a week is way more then you should be asking for. It is misleading. You still have to spend money to get ahead not to mention the runway battles are REDICULOUS. It is full of cheaters wearing skirts on top of dressed and looking completely silly yet they win. And the ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM IS TO JOIN THEM HOWEVER IT'S not even fun anymore!!!",
            "I'm irritated that everything that can help you in the Fashion Arena cost diamonds!! I'm irritated that I did the download of that stupid chef game and finished the tutorial but never recieved the reward for it so I had to spend 5 diamonds to skip it so I could continue with the storyline. It sucks that everytime you get \"busted\" in recieving gifts from fans the price of continuing goes up. This isnt a game. It's a money pit!!!"

In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",

Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",

When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.

        "comments": [
            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

Normal fixes (clear cache, reinstall, etc) do not work. Worked fine until just recently. All other apps on the tablet function, as intended. Only one does not, Verizon.",
            "While the app itself can be useful, please don't allow yourself to fall for the Verizon Up reward program that the app will nag you about incessantly. You essentially agree to allow them to spy on everything you do with your phone, and harvest all kinds of your personal data in the process, by signing up for it. They aren't trying to be your pal, they just want your consent to profit even more off of your account.",
            "It does not save my login credentials - I have to re-log in every time I open it, even when I have \"Remember Me\" selected & permissions on. Logging in is a two-step process so this wastes time. This is the connection my computer uses (a jetpack) & it has a data limit so I need to track it, which means I have to put up with this every day (I haven't found the same information on the website). I didn't have this problem with the old phone, which may have had an older version of the app. Annoying.",
            "The app keeps me up to date with my data limit, I can pay my bill, look at my bill, and get my $3.00 Amazon gift card every month with the app. Make sure you take advantage of receiving and using your $3.00 gift card every month to offset your bill. It's a nice litte bonus at the end of the month that actually helps.",
            "Very buggy along with their website. I been trying to fix my billings, plans, add-ons for the longest time and still seem to be getting the run around. App is worthless and keeps logging me off. Broken links or none what so ever. Now I am wondering if I made the right choice. When downgrading plans, make sure to un enroll in any add-on or you won't be able to un enroll afterwards and be charge each month. Check when changing plans that you don't get hidden or added fees."

Then when you go to use gold bars, if then boots you out. There is still the mini game from lock down too on there that if you push the wrong button, freezes the app and you have to come out and restart again. It's not lack of memory as when I tried it on the tablet I have the same issue...",
            "it is addicting and lots of fun to play. Never gets old! It gets more challenging the higher you go in the levels. Im nearly to leel 500 and its still fun. has gotten really strategic now in levels 500 and above. Now at level 720, it has become much more difficult and at times can be not so much fun but I seem to stick with it to keep going to higher levels. I will find myself on the same level for a while and then suddenly get it and that keeps me interested. I am in level 958 now",
            "I love this game. The only thing that makes me mad at it is the fact the the fairies are dumb af. I mean instead of helping they just don't... how many times have I lost a level cause there are 3 bubbles, one of them is going to fall, but the fairy still chooses that one... other than that yes. I love the game.",

They say on here to contact them when stuck on a level, I did and they told me I needed to buy boosters. Also they ask for suggestions to make the game better. . Shove it up your..... delete",
            "This game started out great but now after playing for several months it constantly crashes!!! Really takes the fun out of playing, especially when it does it while I am in the middle or towards the end of a level!! Uninstalling it.",
            "Level 492 is seriously glitched. You're supposed to collect red and blue to fill up the bottles, but they dont fill up so it is bot possible to complete the level. Other than that, fun game. But this level needs to be looked at and fixed.",
            "I read the reviews but thought I'd try anyway. Unless you pay, ads are forced. The game coding makes it so you either play many times to pass a level or pay-to-play if you don't have enough boosters or coins. A lot of the gamer's responses state they are a small company and the ads help them. They also state that they are looking at making improvements in subsequent updates, yet at the time I installed this game, no improvements or changes were made - compared to the comments in the reviews.",
            "Love 3 match games..having the renovation was extra.. Made it to level 289.. It stop being fun when you take an upscale steak house and clutter the landscape with a childrens playground(waste of time).. The wedding venue space is to small for all the decorations added.. The match 3 is harder as u advance and is not that exciting..takes to long to get stars needed to do a task.."

It would be better with a longer time limit 5 - 10 min or maybe a confirmation before the session ends. \"Are you finished y or n?\" With default to end it if no answer.",

            "I love this game so much ❤❤but it really needs some upgrades like eggs and cakes and many more desserts and you should also give more utensils and dishes and a sink too like a REAL KITCHEN! !! That will make this game 5 stars☆☆☆☆☆. You should also give more guests. This game really need a update to be 5 stars and I will be eagerly waiting for it. And it is so nice of you that you have not added any adds and I hope in the next update also we will not find a single add.",

            "It's a good game. Fun to play, interesting. Only problem is that more ingredients can be included, more cooking methods, and easier stuff. Especially issue is characters. I would like to have more characters. Maybe ones we made in hair salon can come here, like a linked game. Other than that it is funny and entertaining. Certainly you can download. But plz check on characters too."

            "The effect of this app is to REDUCE the income of a doctor. Seriously: mVT asks doctors to pay in order to equip patients with an app that helps avoiding visits. Don't believe it? Google for \"multibit\" and for the sentence \"“The superior quality of the tests enables the app usage to replace many patient visits, liberate hospital resources, ...”. Multibit is like mVT, but developed by Swedish researchers. mVT should be available to patients w/o prescription and give feedback directly to them!",
            "Instead of helping people they decided to make this test prescription only. For no reason at all, just to make it unavailable for the majority of people living on this planet in many countries, having macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. I wish many people give further negative reviews until they change their policy, to the benefit of sick people and to the benefit of themselves earning money.",

They should have taken it to a non profit humanitarian company for funding to help people, or given it to the Israelis to improve on and make for everyone. Or fund through UC Berkeley low vision dept. It's a shame my doctors wouldn't get involved.",

I LIKE IT...<>",

            "Okay I buy this when I was nine and right when I got in it I freeked out I saw a man with a thing on his mouth I did play this I was not scared first i read the comments about this game...But Im vary dumb kids do not buy it.My legs shaked when I saw his eyes 0-0 Just do not buy this game pls!!♥",

            "Fun to play and record but adds are too irritating",
            "The best thing about this app is that in 1 app, there are many many games! This is not only a talking game, also having a candle-blow game. We have to blow the candles otherwise they will go down. My bro is of 5 months and he loves this game and stops crying after watching her talking. I appreciate the team of Outfit 7 for making such an amazing app."

            "I love this game so much! I only had it for a week and its already my favorite. I have a couple of things that could be fixed though. Usually when I get a friend and I check my friends list they are not there which can be annoying. Sometimes when you try to load into a multiplayer game the map randomly isn´t downlaoded and it kicks you out of the game which is annoying too. It would be really cool if there was a friend and clan chat when your not in game. But overall this is amazing. 5 stars.",
            "Very amazing game. This game is very simple. You basically hunt animals and eat them to level up (if your sensitive to blood there's none in this game). You can even raise a cute family! [Maximum family members is 6). You can also change your animal, and it won't loose your progress! You can change it to a fox, bear, cheetah, crocodile, etc! HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃!",
            "I love this game but could you help me get on multiplayer because when I go on multiplayer it kicks me out and says Error connection to server timed out and that happened for 2 years! And it happened for no reason. I could not fix it! And it's still happening! Has that ever happened to you? And when 1 day passes I can go on multiplayer but if I exit and try going back it does the same as I told you at the second sentence.",
            "It's hard to control the eagle with flying, otherwise the controls are pretty darn good. Though I do know my phone is somewhat small and it's hard to simulate flight. I do think they should (if possible) add more plant variation like with bushes in certain maps. Maybe an aquatic update too? As someone who used to play when there was 3 play able animals, it's awesome to see this game grow! Sorry if I set my expectations too high or low, I just want to see the game improve for everyone.",
            "I love it, it is such a great game I have so much playing with outher players and by my self. But, there is some lag if you go on top of the land a little bit behind the poltel you can go throught that bit of land, be stuck there and have to tellport to your den. Beside that it is a great game. (In the clacis one.)"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

            "I gave you only one star because I liked it very little. The problem is that I am a kid and and I can't buy stuff. Your other games are like that too. It is showing that I need to make a blue Very Berry Shortcake but blue is locked. Fix it 😡😡😡😡",
            "Honestly i realy like this game , but i have to buy so PLEASE MAKE IT FAIR . I just dont want to wast my money ok..",
            "Honestly, its pretty fun. But, we barley get options for anything. I really do think that maybe 1 or 2 more cake options should be free, along with more decorations, food dye, and utensils.",
            "Only one cake is unlocked. All the others are locked and you have to pay for each one. One is currently £2.99 and another one is £9.99. Seems like a really lovely app and i wouldn't mind paying if it was for all for £9.99."

            "It starts out as a really fun and challenging game, until you advance to higher levels. It becomes nearly impossible to win certain levels without money, boosters or making purchases. No one likes impossible odds. You continually lose on a level just 1 or 2 moves away from winning. So very frustrating! The more you play, the more you realize, there's no skill or strategy, there's not even chance. The game is anything but random: it's totally controlled and manipulated by the game's programming.",
            "I like the game and how challenging the levels are, but the reason for the rating is that it sucks that the only way to save progress is by signing in with Facebook. I'm not a fan of Facebook and wish there was other options to sign in like Candy Crush has. The rewards could be way better the higher you move up the level not the same as the first 20 levels.",
            "Loved playing this game and did so for quite some time. I got permanently banned because of I was accused of cheating. I was using 2 names. I however, wasnt using both. My grandchildren were. So my advice to all is dont use more than 1 name. Lesson learned. Never would have done that if I knew. Read the rules folks. This is an awesome game though and I will miss it horribly.",
            "A little advice about this game. I have been playing for 2 years now.Been hearing how difficult this game is. I have learned to take my time on difficult level's. Their is no time line to complete a game. With knowing this I am able to figure out the difficult level's. I find this game challenging but rewarding. If it becomes hard just take a break and return when ready. Don't give up. The hard levels aren't impossible. Maranatha!!",
            "This game is addictive because of the teams. When it gets too difficult; and it does; you'll find it necessary to buy boosters with real money. ...It sucks when you can't contribute to your team during the tournaments. Don't fall for the free coins, and unlimited lives scam, that will show up in team chat. I'd give this game five stars, but it's too difficult (to do so😉)."

            "Great game but guild chat is lacking and not linear. It should be obvious and on top of that, the game does not support landscape view, which is a bummer. I am going to have to uninstall because I am using Android on laptop without touch and playing on a phone is hard on the eyes. If you fixed these things, I would give 5 stars and continue to play.",
            "New developers are listening at least. Now this is so far a temporary 5 stars, they have to continue to make the game playable. It's in a fairly good state for active players currently. If you find yourself with Google play cards laying around and nothing seems to interest you, this game is very social and has several communities to join. Will things burn, probably, but that's slowly becoming less of an account destroying experience. If the new developers screw it up, I'll re-review again.",
            "The game is all about pay to play. If you try to play it for free, you'll get so far behind that it is ridiculous. The cost to level up of resources and scrolls is unbelievably expensive. The events don't even tailor to your level (that's how they get you to pay to stay caught up). This game is absolutely horrible. Oh, if you try to contact customer service, you'll get a copy and paste response. They don't care about their players. FYI, the packs go up to the $100's.",
            "It's rated PEGI 7 , but requires purchases that cost more than the average persons weekly shopping. Getting kids to spend £95 on a pack is criminal, (they claim it's free to play) that's also false advertising. You can spend £95 on one hero, then a few days later a new hero will be available which is much better than the one you just bought, that makes your purchase useless. The releases are fast which encourages you to spend more, not much good to say . 👍",
            "I've spent my fair share of money on this game. Developers have no control or care. They allow lvl 50-60 wipe out lower lvl players and allows them to do whatever. If they intended this game to be fun for all they have fail miserably. I've sent tickets in for them to limit 50-60 level players to attack no lower than level 35 so the rest of us can compete. This is a pay to play kind of game, if you don't pay dont play because there's no use."

            "This app was my favorite one at a time it was relaxing and makes me happy but now it is a very bad app . Coz till fifth level we sell ice creams in a motorcycle like thing but when we finish the fifth level it says that the road is rocky so we should pay an amount and get a big van to sell the ice cream. And if we look other characters shop and sell ice creams like blueberry muffins shop . They are closed we should complete all levels of the strawberry shortcake's shop and then get them .",
            "My kids like the strawberry shortcake games and I am even happy to pay for the DLC which I did for this. Unfortunately its locked to my account so even though the kids share a tablet as they have their own accounts. I dont want to pay for everything twice so I'm not buying any more DLC.",
            "It is fun...but you only get 4 levels for free which is pretty dissapointing. There are not many things for free.",
            "The game is a 5 star but I gave it 3 Stars because you have to pay for the game and I cant complete it now sorry if you fix the game then I will give it 5 stars but until then it stays as a 3 star game sorry (just my opinion by the way)",
            "It was a complete 5 star experience, simple and easy to learn building up sequences to fulfill the orders. The issue is without paying the game can not be completed, which is still ok as the effort of development deserves the money, but today we realized the already completed demo regions can not be played for free anymore... This was an awful experience, the price is fair but this action made it considerable to pay.."

            "This game is a lot of fun. You build amazing gardens as you pass different levels. But besides that it has a great interactive feature. You can turn on all your street lights and lanterns thru out your gardens, change plants and statues and benches to give each garden a totally different look. I could go on and on. If there are any draw backs it would be getting stuck on some levels for to many days. That gets very frustrating. Overall a really fun way to spend your time",
            "Its actually relaxing. I see everyone commenting about the difficulty. It happens, but too me that's the point. Why would anyone want too play an easy game. I like my mind being massaged and 4 that reason, I will never quit. I'm on level 1850 something. I lost count. Lol. I do agree at times with winning more, but at other times because of my consistency, I get rewarded a lot of boosters too stay in the game. Use them wisely. Create your own strategy and you'll get ahead. Good luck everyone!",
            "Actually pretty fun. Glad I finally tried it after being bombarded with ads. Still don't know how they monetize this game...I've played as much as I want without being prompted to pay for anything. Graphics good even if storyline is a bit corny. UPDATE: ok...NOW I know how they make coin! They get some $10/month or so from me now. I'm hooked & too often stay up far too late \"just to win one more time.\" The deals can be pretty fair though, and I'd like to think playing keeps dementia at bay :)",
            "You know if you wanna win, you gotta have some tricks.. I'm sorry Gardenscapes, but I have to help them folks... Tricks to beat some level... 1. If you had played for several weeks but can't move up a level, try not to log in for a few days... After that long period, try logging in, and see what Austin have in store for you.. I mean, free gift... 😅 2. Try to create as many boosters as you can then if you're lucky those boosters might sit next to each other then you can make a huge blast!",
            "Fun game. If you want to burn some time, it's not bad. A puzzle game with quests. You literally advance to harder puzzles by doing quests. Still playing after 800 levels. It gets harder and you will need more specials like bombs and rainbow wheels to get past the Super Hard levels or you will start to get frustrated as you will need luck on these maps more so than skill."

            "If you love ads interupting game play, this one is for you!!! You'll get to experience more ad time than game time. You'll get the privilage of the game ratcheting after each ad causing you to have to restart and hope there is not another ad following. If you like bs, this is for you! If not, you might want to skip this app! If it were'nt for all the ads, I'd give the game 5 stars.",
            "Overall the game is good, but dis game is also an ad vector, so it wont stop giving you ads after everytimw u completed a course, even worse its a 15 second ad, can you shorten the ad by removing vungle ads they suck at making ads, i would rate it 5 stars if it werent for ads, and i developed a secret technique: Just disable wifi and mobile data so it wont give you ad now i dont need to pay to remove ad mwehehehehemwehehehehe u cant stop meeeeeeeee >:)",
            "Absolutely amazing and addictive game. I love playing this, but there is one small problem. The thing is that the levels are very hard so if hutch could just make the levels a bit more easier that would be great! The controls and the gameplay is awesome. Overall I LIKE THIS!!",
            "I really like this game. Its interesting to play. But I have problem when I try to do challenges it works perfectly fine. But when connection is lost. At the end of the race it loses my 1st live and asks me to do the whole race again. Please fix it. So that I won't lose a single live. It happened to me 6th time and I lost all lives and have to pay gems to continue. Please fix it. Or I will delete this game. Thank You",
            "This game was fun at first, and I tried it again because of that, after giving it 3/5 stars. I was about to give it 4/5 stars when I reconsidered. The scam of this game is they give you difficult-to-control vehicles and make it nearly impossible to get anywhere without struggling against your machine to get upgrades. Nice work Mattel: Now everyone knows what Hot Wheels are good for. May you and your families Race Off the road, you strategically illiterate schmucks."

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

But they could not go upstairs. I escaped! But in a boat. I tried to escape the front door but the only problem was the hand wheel was not working right. I got everything but just missed a step LOL! This gets a star for effort and credit because this game is awesome! :)",

It happens after opening the game and accept the privacy policy. But I watch it's vedios in Youtube, it seems funny! I wanna play too! Can you solve that problem, \"DVloper\"? I hope you will! Thanks for making this great game! I have never played it before, so I have rated it with 3 starts. If the problem f",
            "I loved this game very much😍😍😍. I played this game many times in Practice Mode until I mastered this. But there is a glitch that you should fix. When Granny reached the stair in the 2nd Floor and I left the door open, I hide under the bed, she is only at the end of the stairs, and WHAM!!! Instant jumpscare. Please fix it and all of the rest of the glitches. Thank you😘😘😘.",
            "This game is really good! Even better then the original Granny game, because: easier to find items, and new endings. And It's more easier to get the helicopter ending for me. (For some reason) Thank you for making this game! And the easier way to play the game with an enemy is with Grandpa. Thank you the developers for making this game!",
            "This game is like ossom. I think that the first chapter of this game is a little bit hard for me .It seems that the house was small but there were too much of secret doors .But in this we can easily explore the house 🏠 in the practice mode.GRANDPA has added a lot of attraction in this game. I had goosebumps whenever GRANDPA says I SEE YOU !!!😁😁. LOVE THIS GAME SOO MUCH 😘😘😘"

Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",

            "I love the Kindle app! Never thought I would read e-books because I prefer to read a physical copy, but with covid and recently down sizing e-books are so much easier to read, and store! They take up no space. Best of all with the free Kindle app you can read books for free. Other books do cost but you do not have to buy anything to be able to read! Book lovers need this app!",
            "This app is well done as expected from Amazon. However, my biggest frustration is that highlighting is based on whole words and not characters. There are times where I will need to highlight one word and the current highlighting system makes it impossible without highlighting other objects around it. There are apps that allow for character based highlighting. Please change this and I will change my review to 5 stars.",
            "Bug-ridden garbage. Latest update 28/1/19 just marked all my books as new & unread when most of them should be partially or wholly read. So much for \"bug fixes\"! October 2020. There's an expression, \"If it ain't bust, don't fix it.\" Doesn't apply in this case. Definitely bust. Oh, and you'll need a magnifier to see the new Aa menu.",
            "The Kindle icon recently disappeared from my screen, so I reinstalled the app. The icon has re-appeared, but when I try to open any book from my library I get a message saying that Kindle has closed. Kindle no longer works on my device (Google Nexus). Does this have anything to do with the upgrade on 15th October ? If this isn't fixed soon I'm going to be asking for a refund for all the Kindle books in my library. Not happy.",
            "App itself is ok, latest update is hot garbage. Honestly I'm amazed they haven't hotfixed it yet, considering all the people who can't use the store at all right now. Pretty tired of getting push notifications, only to select them and get an error when it tries to display a store page. My other major annoyance at the moment - they decided to default to autoscroll instead of page flip, even when you've previously turned it off. How hard is it to just set it according to what the user specified?"

Only get this game if u are really desperate and have nothing else to do. Btw can people STOP moaning about ads as they r needed to keep the game free. If u care that much then dont play the game!!!!!! Duh.",
            "2 issues, ads and lag. Even with a $900 LG V60, this game lags like im playing on a slow phone from 9 years ago. Constantly dropping from a smooth 60fps to 10-15fps. Also, the ad situation is awful. This developer is great at creating a simple, creative game concept, and then ruining it with insane amounts of ads. Literally everytime you die you are faced with a 15-30 second UNSKIPPABLE ad, which happens often with the god awful lag. Which ends up making this more ad watching, than game playing.",
            "It makes me wanna scream, very laggy, i've noticed the developers don't look at the ratings and don't fix the problem, my phone suppers not rejester me swiping the virtual ball the ads are clickbait, it's hard trying to get the ball in the middle, overall just a sucky app",
            "LOVE THIIIIIIISSSSSS but there is lots of lagging I have a good quality phone because its lagging it's weird but it's the game. Worth playing very fun and can get a little boring.",

            "Don't, just don't. I got into the 4400's for my level, so I played this quite a bit. They even got me to shell out money for the events a couple of times, which no other game managed. 500 characters isn't enough to fully explain why this isn't worth your time. And when I post this,if I get a reply from the company, it will be an insincere copy-paste that screams minimal effort for maximum money grab. You will spend less money if you just buy a mobile game. Also, the deceitful ads are a thing.",
            "Same matching game it always has been. They REALLY need to stop advertising it as a different game. They even went through the trouble of adding an initial level thats like the advertisements and then it goes back to matching gems....they could EASILY create the same style of game with different ways to earn the energy you need to complete tasks. I would love to see them develop a similar game with a play style similar to the click-bait ads they create.",
            "Started off as a very good game, but at level 64 it has become impossible to advance without spending money. Very poor as it reels you in then basically the only way to advance is to spend spend spend. Have tried over 80 times and its the same outcome because you don't have enough turns to complete the level. IF the developers respond I guarantee it will the same stock answer they all use. Very poor indeed. Have now uninstalled.",
            "When you reach a certain level, you are mandated to play a Tournament of Champions. You cannot play the regular game. So if you are in the middle of a game and the game expires before the tournament is over, you loose your points and potential winnings. Some people paid to get coins to play these games which is a huge waste of money. The game designers should either be ashamed of themselves or be sued.",
            "Such a great game. What I like the most about this is that it does not have ads. Not even a single ad since the day I first played it. Such a nice game. Playrix company always make great games. So, this was all its praise. But the reason I gave it 4 stars is that the levels are too hard. Hey hey hey! But not every level. I mean 2/5. And it is specially mentioned there that the levels are going to be difficult. But we can clear the levels by using power ups. This was all my suggestion. Bye."

            "The Game is very nice. My Younger Brother loves it a lot. But the only problem is that --What kind of school is that in which there is no education , only photo clipping , playing and eating. Is that how a kinder garden runs ?Well , I know it is a baby game and that is a kinder-garden. All objects are fine but there should be a bit of Baby Study. That's all I wanted to say . Thank you . And please fix the game as I told . Thus baby will get entairtent as well as they will learn some Study also.",
            "I love the way Baby Bus apps have back to back 30 second forced adverts that my 2 year old gets to watch. No way to skip them, but hey, i guess it's okay if you get 2 yr old kid to click and mistakenly install some app. What do you make, 1 cent per install? You guys make quality software, but your attempt to get revenue is horrendous. Let me give my 2.99 to buy an add free experience so that my kid can play in peace, PLEASE. Update: just uninstalled all your apps because they make my kid rage when they are unable to play the game because stuck on adds and in non google store app install screens. just a shame you guys can't put yourself in the shoes of a child.",
            "I like it but there should be more things at the kindergarden like a playground , study, and thus if they get hurt there should be a nurse's office .anyway I like this game 👍hope you make more games😄. That is all I wanted to say bye.",
            "Well it's good but it is not that educational for kids 1-6 years who are playing this, they need to learn not play. In this game they are just picking animals up and not taking them to, you know, KINDERGARTEN. Please fix your game it needs to be a bit educational, when I ment by educational, what I mean is they need to learn a bit and some babyish education",
            "I love thos game it is educating for children. an if you only have one baby bus game then...you should really install more cause the baby bus brand is now a best seller well i think. but in my book it would be the 2cnd best seller an you should really install not just this game but many more games from baby bus many more.an i hope you take my advice but anyways have a nice day or night when ever your reading my feedback."

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",

This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

            "Meh. In the beginning it's great but now after 2 years it's completely stale. I've dropped enough money into the game to see it go no where. The rewards are lacking, the amount of time, energy and money you need to tier 3 characters is laughable. I'm tired of timeline battles and old story modes. Everything is just repeating... It's no longer fun. I will play once a day and then move on to better things and eventually just stop playing all together. Not dropping anymore more money into this.",
            "Been playing this game since 4 years now and these are the things that I've realized...they never listen to their player base; rewards against your hard work are just peanuts; used to be free to play friendly, but over a period of time, it has become more paywall friendly. No improvement in rewards but unnecessary changes in the game to grab your cash. So, if you wish to play this game coz of your beloved Marvel Characters, you need to be filthy rich. I used to support this game but no more.",
            "I have played this game for 5 years on different accounts. Never have I ever felt cheated before. But the new system introduced in the latest update has broke the game. If you pay, you win. Its that simple. The cost has increased exponentially (to the thousands) and as such I cannot recommend this game. I loved this game but its finished now. Find a better game to invest in.",
            "Playing this game is like collecting good looking models. That's it. Oh, a number of them, you need real cash to get them, and a few of those are not worth it gamewise. After years of playing, I find it not enjoyable anymore due to the cost it demands every update. I feel sorry for my investment to this game up until recently. If you, reader, want a Marvel game to play, this isn't the one. Hard pass.",
            "I've been playing for a long time but this latest update is horrible. Confusing and redundant systems being added that do not enhance the game but seem to be geared to force players to spend money. I do not recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a game LOOK ELSEWHERE. Even veteran players are boycotting this game. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!"

            "Sorry folks,got to down grade my review. First: New players don't fall into the Facebook trap it's more trouble than it's worth. Second: I agree with other players in regards to the time it takes to get results back from tests, and to many ads. If you're that hard up for $ make the sponcers pay not the players. Third: come on guys, make this more player friendly and more people will play. That's a no brainer",
            "I love this game! I've been playing it for many years. What I don't understand is why it says I have to download a separate app (for Travel in Time) when, in the past, it's let me use just the 1 app for all the chapters (Pacific Bay, Save the World, Mysteries of the Past & the Conspiracy). I would rather be able to use the same app like I have been this whole time than have to not only download another app but not have all of my XP, stars, energy & money not be carried over",
            "They are now putting ads in between plays. Never had them before. Nevertheless love playing CC. I broke down and bought the ad removable app. It works but when I go to send out anything I get..Invalid access_ code when trying to do it. I have contacted Facebook and Criminal Case. They are telling me that I need to contact Google play cause that was the card I purchased the ad remover using. Google play is to fix the problem. So google play.....fix it! Been 3 weeks.",
            "I love this game and the only reason it isn't getting five stars is because recently, the videos to recieve extra time and daily rewards will not play. If this glitch can be fixed, I will gladly change my review. Thanks. This problem still occurs. So I have changed my review to two stars. I will change it to five if and when it is fixed. It is a true disappointment in an otherwise great game.",
            "Was running fine & progressing nicely until it tried to force me to accept a Facebook policy, I cannot accept the cookies as screen won't drag to press accept as screen size has changed, so it means I'm no longer able to send help/ items to friends or ask for help with reports at the end of each case, also feeding pets has changed to adverts only which now takes forever....really disappointed & frustrated so please change it back to 5 min timers & cut the excessive adverts for everything"

Update late 2020...I've dropped my star rating due to the fact that the number of ads in this game has been increased nearly three fold. It's just too many ads!! I know the developers want to make some money, and they deserve it. I do not begrudge them, but come on folks! This is WAY too many ads!",
            "I love this game! If you dont play this game, know that this game gives off the opposite of plenty of time, if we had more time, i would be level 49, i think the game creator should add more time, like 5 minutes or some thing but you can still install it",
            "I'm baaaack, and still loving this game. Some say we're playing against the computer robots but who cares as long as I win. My question is in Battle Royale..... U say last hole standing wins, but when there's 2 last holes, why don't the one with the crown win? Doesn't seem fair for both to reach the max [19]. No Ties when one reaches 1st with crown. 1st Max [19] with crown, takes All. Default king or queen, I am still Queen 👑even when I bow out and hand the crown to U!",
            "This honestly WAS my favorite game. Had it for Years as did my family. These insufferable asshats have now made it so that the game literally STOPS after one minute - ya, SIXTY SECONDS - and you are forced to watch an ad before continuing for another sixty seconds, when the game finishes and you are forced to watch yet another ad. Are you freaking serious?? I am uninstalling after years of play, and so is my entire family. Don't put up with these ads people! Find games with reasonable ad time!",
            "I love this game, yes, but after they got rid of wireless play and put a half time in the middle of the game it just makes the game kind of annoying, the half time feature is just a waste of time definitly meant to get more adds in so the creators can get more money."

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

            "So I loved this game and I paid for no ads, and got all the monsters. But yet I guess now that I'm towards the \"end\" I have to watch an ad to play. No problem but 1. I paid for no ads. None. And I can't watch the ad to play your game. It keeps saying there's no video available, try again later and freezes. So over all. Love the actual game and game play, but don't waste your money and be fully prepared to not be able to move forward in the game. I got to 77, I passed. I can't play the other 3.",
            "My daughter loved this game but since she got to level 61, she can't revive. If she does, the character moves but the screen doesn't move with her. She also is having a problem with the repair alphabet rooms. She's on room F, has done everything, but it won't reward her or unlock the next room. Gutting for a 6 year old. I think she's finished the game, she's just replaying some levels now.",
            "I love this game, but as soon as I tried to paint on room 2 everything froze, I tried turning my phone on and off, closing the game... nothing worked! It might of been a virus but I'm not sure, I loved this game so much and ended up having to uninstall it then reinstall. I have had to start ALL OVER AGAIN 😠😠😠 That is why I have to give it a three out of five, sorry! It is a really fun game though.",
            "I originally had this game on an Amazon tablet where the ads are contained. After upgrading my son's tablet to a more powerful android device I re-download this. This game is flooded with microtranaction and ads even after paying the 2 dollars to \"remove ads\". What this $2 doesn't include is the need to watch 30s ads for each level after level 16 everytime you play a lvl. This is false advertisement and dishonesty around paying $2 to \"remove ads\". DO NOT download for your kids. I want my $2 back",
            "I give this game a 1 out five because everytime I try to play the game it kicks me out I haven't evan got to see if the game was nice cause it kicks me out . I don't recommend this game for anyone, it just takes up space that you can use for another app that actually works!!.very bad quality, very bad game!!!!!!!!!"

            "I did an update last night causing me to lose lives I had stored up, gold bars and even though I beat level 734 over 6 times it will not let me move past. On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",
            "I've been playing ALL the Bubble Witches for years now and I COMPLETELY fell in love with all of them! 🥰 I have a panic disorder and these games help so much to soothe my anxieties and let me focus on the fun! I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

            "Was a great app, but when one purchases an app outright in full, then later is asked to now pay/subscribe to use half the tools suddenly is not okay at all. I never have & never will use subscription services. If you had the option to buy a new upgraded version each year, I'd be ok with that. But to pull a \"re-pay\" stunt like that for existing customers, leads me straight to the exit on this. I will no longer be recommending this app to the vast amount of others I work with unless changed.",
            "I paid for this app in full to get the premium mode a year or so ago. Now it's asking me to pay for a new version. Go and get f***Rd. I actually loved this app and was my absolute preferred app for editing photos. You had to ruin it and get greedy shame on you. And do not bother commenting saying why don't you try the free 7 day trial... You've lost me as a customer seeya",
            "This app is trash! It just crashed on me. I unintalled. The reason I bought this app was to animate some charachters in gacha. If you plan to do that as well I do not reccomend it! Its too complex to even know how/where to use the chroma key (if there even is one), and it crashes way to easily for me. 1 star for me. Experience wasn't the best at all.",
            "EDIT: One problem is that adding an image downgrades the quality of that image a lot. REST: Honestly I think I hit the jackpot downloading this app first as an editing app. It has literally everything you could ever ask for in a photoshop app. The scene option at the very end is pretty fun to mess around with also. You can pay for premium, but that just gives you a few extra effects, atleast I think. Which means this is probably the best free editing app you can get out there right now.",
            "I used to luv this app.But when i started my subscription, the app started crashing. My subscription will end Nov 2020.Cant save an edited photo..it just keeps crashing.it's good i just subscribed for a month or else ive wasted my subscription fee for a longer period."

Plus creates much more intensive study of \"hundreds\" of unlockable characters and their superpowers. The opt-in upgrades are cheap enough, and for about 20 dollars I unlocked about a dozen characters in under three weeks, including Superman, Batman, Lex Luthor, Bane, Green Arrow and both versions of Deadshot!",

Only one request please provide hero fragments for other heroes in the Red Alert battles such as Superman, Wonder Woman etc. And please do something to spend the essence and to earn legendary essence. I have earned over 30 million essence but still haven't finished it up yet. But the legendary essence is getting finished quickly. Please resolve this issue.",

            "I enjoyed it alot, but I finished it really quickly. I loves it so much tho. I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yes🤞"

            "It's a great app, it doesn't take that long to master, the community is great (especially on the reddit, it's full of players helping eachother), and when you're ready to tackle the weekly challenge, you get a great free character! I've been playing since about late July, and I already have about 6-7 gold characters, the majority I got for free! Also, the MP mode is a little off-balance, since the Nth Metal characters screw it over, but it's still just an incredibly fun game.",
            "In my oppinion, this is by far one of the best free to play mobile games of all time. Game was highly unstable when I picked it up, patches have greatly improved performance and crashes are rare now. There is an offline mode, survival mode, and online battle mode, in addition to the relatively new \"breakthrough\" and \"phantomzone\" modes for increased unlock potential. Also, did I mention there are zero ads??!! I do think the new Nth metal heroes are slightly overpowered, and expensive to level.",
            "A simplified version of the console game. Fighting animations are smooth (compared to the second one). It might be just my phone but there is something robotic and off with the injustice 2 mobile fighting animations that doesnt feel normal compared to this one. Gameplay is simple.You get to play, collect and level up your favorite DC characters on the go. Having this game available offline is very convenient too. Granting easy access so that you can continue grinding even without wifi.",
            "This game is awsome the fighting is simple and easy to understand and the range of characters and their depictions are super cool. The only thing that would make it better is if they had updated the graphics and save system instead of making a whole new game that is not as fun in my opinion because of the massive amount of commands you have to memorize inorder to fight.",
            "Good game, only problem is the survival rules regarding changing characters. How is putting a character in and subbing them out to maybe use later regarded as an elimination, huh. I lost 20K coins and some other stuff, all because I mistakenly put a character I didn't want to put at the time and confirmed before going back to change it. When I finally lost, I was banking on using it to clear round 9 before cashing out. Alas dumb rules cost me. MXM what a stupid rule, seriously."

It has nothing to do with it being mosty free, which is up to you to pay, but with all the free options, I have no idea what's included with the paid version! A MUST DOWNLOAD!! ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!! Thanks so much for such an awesome Photo Editing App!! Keep up the AWESOME WORK!!",
            "besides the excessive ads and the impending fear of not being able to use the app at all (for the purpose I downloaded it for) thanks to the forceful hand of a monthly-paid membership,, this app works great. it's literally the only thing I've found where I'm able to edit moodboards the way I've been wanting to, so I thank it for that",
            "This app is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for like 2 years now. If you understand all the features (which are so many), you won't ever need any other photo editing app. It has no logos after making a collage or editing, great layouts , different sizes with ratios and options while making collage to crop , swap , delete , anything. You can choose the border or just have no borders. it's just awesome. Thanks for the app makers.",
            "Like flying for the first time. Like a pool on a hot summer day in Modesto. Like a cup of hot chocolate on Christmas. Like checking ALL the boxes on your daily to do list. Like having all the laundry folded after watching an episode of the magicians, except that towel you used to wipe your tears with. Like strawberry bingsu in loser angeles in August. Like hugging your mom. Like reaching Challenger in Starcraft. Like making before after pictures of when you finally clean. Like comment subscribe.",
            "Very nice app ...I accidentally uninstall this up and I almost cry ..good thing after searching for days I found it..this is very useful in making invitations..I just wish you add more text options, calligraphy,and color like gliter effect on text .good thing this is update new effects were add..kudos to the developer..keep up the good work."

            "I loved my town able to have any character with no ads or unlocks which was money and same for the clothing and other items, but now most of the games cost money and not free almost every single character and clothing cost money or ads, and if their showing a little bit of skin it will give them a tank top which I find dumb, and it resets my progress so I have to rewatch ads, I really hope this is fixed for most of the games because I really like these games when I was young, thank you if you do",

Is this true I just thought it was best friends house OMG it's really like my town best friends house thank u my town for doing this amazing update and a small suggestion if u are giving games free then do some updates in that too (like renovating them) so that u will get more players u are marvelous!!",

Mine is wearing mask but my sister and brother not!!!!! Please fix this!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😤😤",

You also should also bring all the clothes you had in the closets . Only some clothes are free . If you don't mind, please make the app as it was , please . I like the old version more than this one . And please also free up all the characters. ( In all your games ) ."

We didn't know we were paying for broken junk. Fix it. 6/20 Playback still bugged. 6/1 Playback still bugged. Still hasn't responded to email. Worthless app. They created a playback bug with the 4/2020 update and have yet to fix. 4/11 Playback is bugged. It keeps freezing or going to another point when I try to playback.",
            "This App became USELESS. It was so good 2years ago, so easy to connect and view the cameras. Wth happened, since I did the update it seems the app has issues connecting. I uninstalled and installed back to app, refresh internet router wifi everything to make sure that was working and still has same issue It just keeps getting worse! It doesnt connect anymore, I'm unable to monitor cameras if I'm away from home. 😡",
            "Was great at first. Now after 3 days of using it the notifcation have stopped. Ive when into app notifaction menu and set to urgent high priority and still nothing. I thought maybe no movement is being dected. So i check playback and sure enough its catching and recording movement but fails to notify me.",
            "The app will not load all my cameras and it's so glitchy. Great cameras and monitor but what's the point of having a app if you can't use it!! Definitely time for another update please cause your last one apparently didn't do anything. I could I'd went to harbor freight and got better quality off their app. So may be returning this all because you can't watch them on your phone from anywhere like it says! All lies",
            "All of a sudden, getting no push notifications. When I try to check alerts, I get a message that says \"Failed to get alarm message\". I've checked the settings on my phone to make sure I can get the notifications and every thing is fine. Is this an update issue? Very irritating!"

            "Firstly, I intend to buy the no-ads feature. That being said, I'm judging this on the assumption I shouldn't have to for a decent experience. Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",
            "Fun but the ads were annoying. I'd rather have a long ad that I can't skip than short ones every few seconds. I can't take it anymore. Uninstalling",
            "I bought the ad free version but it doesn't give you the option to sign in when downloaded to a new device and Google Play says I already own it and can't buy it again, not that I want to pay for it again.",
            "This is a really boring game. I hate it soooooooooo much and it's very annoying because you could only stick the couple a million bazillion times anyways make this game fun or exciting. Oof edited this and still it's so BORING and ANNOYING. Please upgrade it."

Daycare 3. Space theme 4. Hospital 5. School i know these already exist but they would be cool to customize. 6. Pets to the customize list 7. Clothes to the customize list. 8. Masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to the list also. I know its a lot and it doesn't effect my game if they don't exist. I love your game! Bye!",
            "This game is amazing I love it so much and it is even better with the free updates , I can not believe they are free! But talking about what is free or not,the game is only starts getting really fun when you make purchases which is not so cool. Over all amazing game it is fun and cool.I love toca boca !!!

            "I would have given it five star but u can fix the bug that when we keep things in our house from somewhere else and when we reopen the game it goes back in it's original place and the full version of the game is very costly u can at least give the full game for free only for three days trail so that we can see the other places that how it is like and then buy it. But it's the best game for kids worth game.",
            "I absolutely love this game! However I think there is a bug now that they added the Halloween update. I have seen other reviews that say that the houses are total wrecks. Mine is the same. My houses I decorated have furniture just in a pile, and everything else is just purple. Purple walls, outside on the balcony is purple, the floors are purple, and I cant move anything. Please please fix this bug. I have spent a lot of birthday money on this.",
            "The game is overall good, but before I bought the misty cottage. I had an amazing world and I must have atleast spent 5 hours working on it in total. But as soon as I got the misty cottage, the game started glitching out. Early morning the next day I went on the game and my whole world reset. Now that got me upset. I wish to report this app and I want it to be reported and sorted out immediately. I have everything in the game and its around £70 for it all. Not funny at all. Sort it out please"

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

I and Many others along with me using this application for this feature preferably. what kind of update is this where you are decreasing features instead of increasing. removing this feature may reduce the popularity of this App world wide.

In this update we improve the call blocking experience for users on Android 10 (“Android Q”) and higher: incoming calls that you wish to block will now be blocked completely, and not forwarded to voicemail!

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

            "I had been using free version for a long time. As a truck driver, being able to look a few hours ahead to track radar was very helpful to timing travel in mountainous areas. Since i loaded an update, it's worthless. The radar only shows for a short time prior to present. It no longer shows any future projections for radar movement. Way to ruin a good resource for weather info. Certainly not considering a subscription now.",
            "It's not free! It's an expensive trial. Don't waste your time. There are too many free apps with less ads that do way better job than this, which was obviously developed by a programmer in the first grade. use 1weather, had less intrusive ads or use the weather channel. This is for people who buy their first Android phones and don't know any better which is why they have no money",
            "I came to this after Dark Sky's sold out, my big complaint is that it does not offer future predictions on the radar, it only offers current and past. I pay for the yearly membership since I'm a truck driver and its a tax write off and it has other benifits that are helpful to me. I'd love to see this feature added, and if it does it would change my rating to 5 stars.",
            "After my disappointing experience w/the Accuweather and WeatherUnderground apps, I avoid paid upgrades and memberships. So if you do not upgrade and you can tolerate the aggressive pop-up advertising, then in my opinion the free version of the NOAA app is good enough to provide you w/a quick forecast and temperature reading. That's the case for now until paid membership becomes mandatory in the inevitable future. But always, keep your eyes on the skies.",
            "I depend on this app for real time weather. Having a farm with horses it's nice to look and see bad weather that pops up real fast. Direct TV goes down and I get no info on the severity of bad weather without th[s app. The local weather channel gives no up to date even if it is up in running. I even have a NOAA weather radio that is my back up. Awesome app!!!!!"

            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

            "Very cute, been playing with these characters individually for years and had always wondered what it would be like if we could have all the characters living together. The new update is ok, although I don't like the appearance of the toilets, bathtub and the pool, green makes it look like they're broken. Also can you fix the sound? Apparently everyone now has Tom's voice instead of their own voices.",
            "This game is so best and so cute. 😘😘. But the problem is add some more toys and the main problem is they sleep very quick and add more people. That's it to improve. I would like to appreciate this game. But sorry, I will give only 4 rating because you need to improve this game with more fun. So sorry but please do improve it. The game is so awesome. I liked this game👍👍👍",
            "I love this game so much. You can buy foods,and sometimes,you need to watch add to get rewards. This app is good for children like me. Try this app now! In this app,you can buy foods for Tom and his friends. Not just that! Install this app so that you will know all the the things in here! Try this app now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "This app is great! Tom and his friends are soooo cute🤩 There are many surprises to discover and endless possibilities to do! The minigames are great(my favourite is sky skater) the only requests I want to have is 1. Make more toys in the treehouse 2. Make costumes more easy to find 3. There should be a makeup table ( we could also do it for the boys too and see how the girls would react to it) it's a great game though five stars!😄😄😄",
            "I have rated this game with 4 stars..because there should be many more features if you give some more things etc..would enjoy the game a lotttt..I liked it so much than other games. Appreciable. My wish is please add features like there should be makeup room for Angela etc.., changing dress for Tom, ginger etc..,and in the house there should be some more like all the six should play hide n seek etc..And one more can you add 3 to 4 people more😜plaese can you. N how 2 update there's n option"

            "Fun Game, Too Many Ads. Finished a level? Watch an ad. Don't want an ad? Here's one anyway. Here's another ad, I didn't skip the last one fast enough. Way too much. I timed it and for every 2 minutes of actual gameplay, I had 3 minutes 48 seconds of total ads",
            "It is really good in terms of the difficulty and the different gamemodes and I have to say that the sound and music is really good. There maybe too many ads but the is a cross button to click it away so not really a problem and I like the tutorial level as it is animated.",
            "Annoying the app continues to show notifications even after they have been turned off, They just use a different push notification. I have had 6 notifications in 15 mins and I have now removed the app.",
            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "Great app for storing and viewing photos. Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",

(more activities and games please! thank you so much) 😻🤍",
            "Ok, this game is interesting, BUT! I have some few complains........ When tom grows, he isn't cute at all! And when his emoji level is down, he simply gets angry at me at a certain age. When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

            "A great, funny game, I have decided to revisit it after several years, but why is it so much harder to make the ninja stand on top of a tower or a crate than before? It gets annoying when he keeps on tripping himself for 5 minutes and can't stand straight. I have tried a lot of ways(Throw him/Gently place him, etc) sometimes it just comes to luck if he can stand or not, please fix this, thank you.",
            "Honestly, this game was going so well for me personally till the controls and that started messing up bad. When you try and put your ninja on one of the towers you jump off, he wont stay there. He would stand there then walk off it without you telling him to walk somewhere. The camera with it is bad as well. If you try and put the ninja on the tower to jump onto a crate, the camera will move forward and make him stand on that instead, which is rather annoying.",
            "Hi Clumsy Ninja Team. I love this game a lot but as many people's are facing this problem that progress doesn't save. Today I open it and played it I am on Level 29 and going to level 30 but when i opend it again then it get me back to level 1 please fix this issue. I have gain many progress coins all of other stuff please give my Progress back. I didn't expect this as i love this game and today this happened with me. Please Clumsy Ninja Team Fix It.🙏🙏",
            "Love this game, played when I was little. Keep trying to improve the game. Anyone can enjoy even if they are 60 (lol). nothing else to say, but great game, I can see why its called clumsy ninja I've never seen a ninja this funny and clumsy. AMAZING!",
            "The title of this game describes it perfectly. Be prepared for frustrating controls as the ninja flails and falls alot. It doesn't help that it can take quite a few seconds to recover his footing, even longer if he gets stuck in items as he rolls over. Get to the beams and it becomes much worse. Problematic depth detection and a small space to place the ninja resulted in over 5mins just to complete a beam session. Not recommended game unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for failures."

            "Best framing simulator i ever played. It needs some awards when played to certain stages. For instance when you get up to $1000,000 in your farm account. But I beleave the developers cannot make anither farming simulator that can match Farm track 14. Can I get the company e-mail address?",

            "It's a fantastic game, and I'm very addicted to it. It's a great introduction to FS, and it's sold me on buying the sequels. But! This version is so old that there are a number of bugs that mean it's not suitable for new hardware. In the version I have, seeds and fuel never run out. Also, sometimes a section of your field turns a different colour and won't turn back. If GIANTS continue to offer this game for new devices on the app store, they need to clean it up and make it work correctly.",
            "This is very best game of farming but some problem in this game the some tractor are not unlock they are uinlock with rral money of high rate so u increase the rate of tractor but not unlock with real money. I like handle in game in game setting the handle is not aavible before the handle is avalible.so u change the setting.",

Yes the gameplay can seem difficult at first but once you get use to the game mechanics you will appreciate it. Choose a tank that is right for you and blow the competition away! If you get stuck with a tank you don't like. Sell it switch countries work your way up the tier and I guarantee you'll find a tank that fits your style!",
            "I don't know why since 2020 my signal has become very annoying and dropped. Before 2020, i loved to play this game without any lazy feeling! I think it is one of the best tank game on Android, but starting from update 7.0 the game has started to became a high ping and Loss. I think they change the Asia server 😢 i was very disappointed. Now, one of the most funnest game i know (WoTB) has become annoying because of the stupid connection, so I'm going to play other games right now",
            "The gameplay isn't too far off from World of Tanks and War Thunder. My complaint is that the game is very picky on when it wants to properly run. It will give me errors on certain times but will run fine as if nothing happened and it will always have trouble trying to \"load in resources\". How do I even fix Error Code 28? Someone told me that I have to switch wifi networks just to play the game. PLEASE FIX ERROR CODE 28. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO SWITCH WIFI NETWORKS.",
            "This game is fantastic. The game is well balanced. I dont know why everyone says that the premium tanks are just to good. They really arent, if your good at the game, you can easily beat them. The gameplay is so fun, the controls or great, and i would argue that this is the best tank game there is (other than World of Tanks on PC). But thats just an opinion. I fully recomend this to all who love to build up skill and really learn how to play a game. Thabk you so much Wargaming, KEEP IT UP!👌👍😊",
            "I really enjoy this game, 70% of the time. Unfortunately the max view range and hidden tanks feature is a bit annoying. Which to be fair they fixed with the \"hard core\" mode but that is only a temporary game mode. I wish it was a permanent addition to the game. The graphics are great for a mobile/cross platform game. The controls are pretty good for a mobile device. The monthly or bi monthly events are great and a lot of fun to mix up the game and keep it entertaining."

More often then not pictures will not come through and in the rare case they do, they will only be displayed in thumbnail form and when clicked to expand will show previous pictures in the thread! Not the expected and typical performance ive come to know and love from google, you know the ones who developed android?😒",

The video will send to other OnePlus users but when I sent to other androids like samsung and iphones it don't send at all even if the video is 2 seconds long still will not send. Can you help me?",
            "MMS won't send pics, attach pics to messages never displays them in Gallery. Support tells me to reinstall the app as a fix. My question to support is why release an app in the first place that requires something like that for what's considered base functionality for a cell phone? You're taking away Hangouts which I used for txt before, so this is unacceptable to me as a solution.",
            "The app is the default SMS option on my phone. I've used it for years, and a bug since last winter has started deleting SMS history, which isn't recoverable. I lost years of conversations with people, and Google hasn't bothered to fix the app. This is beyond infuriating. The only restoration is to wipe my phone, use Pixel backup, still lose a week's of conversations, and then manually backup my SMS content each day. This is a well-reported issue, and Google doesn't offer a real solution."

            "Great game! I've been playing maybe 4 months now and, hey, I'm still here and a daily player! The gameplay is very similar to Dragon Mania, but there are more events, ways of earning free stuff, and tons of side-quests to do. The game is fun and keeps me busy! I would recomend this app to everyone who likes fighting and collecting games. Did I mention there are also live duels and PVP aspects of the game?!?!?",
            "The game is awesome and all, but I do have a couple complaints. First, I do not like when I press \"Repeat\" on accident when I'm about to breed two monsters, why not make another tab asking if you really wanna repeat just in case we do press it? Second is just a recommendation, but if you're removing like, a medium rock and it only has less than an hour left to finish, it'd be cool if you would make it cost gold at that point.",
            "I really like this game! The graphics are definately simething that I also enjoy. However, I find it unbelivable that gems are so hard to get and majority of the monsters are really expensive. I think that it would be better if it was easier to obtain gems, like giving more gems for daily reward, making gems the reward for completing daily tasks or so. Thank you for reading this! I hope you consider this post!",
            "This game is really good and gives you something to do if you are bored. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is just because there is so much downtime whenever you want to play. For example if you wanted to do the campain you only have a certain amount of energy. I get why they do this but I dont like how long you have to wait in order to be able to do the missions again. I do love the fact however that you can get free epics, rares, and legendaries with the maze events. I recommend the game!",
            "Honestly it's a really good game and it's addicting but some of the past updates have made it harder to play for example, the dungeons use to give really good rewards that helped you progress through the game faster and easier but now it gives really low rewards and as well of rewards in general like a roulette wheel spin, I don't know if it's because of my level but either way this game is really awesome and you should download and try it if you haven't already."

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemic🤍 God Bless🤍"

Overall good graphics and addicting. You dont need to spend money on the game unless you are willing to support the developers. And there is barely any ads! (Besides ad rewards) im new and got some new cars!",
            "Good graphic, good control, best racing game so far. -1 star is the introduce of touchdrive auto drive which takes away players excitement although you have an option to manual steer but it became unfair since others just touchdrive. That's the only down side for this version. Update- uninstalled, seems like there's bug or virus that mess up with my phone. First came out ads issue, then cause my phone can't charge. Nearly goes into store to warranty my phone..",
            "One of the best arcade racer in the market. I'm having fun with this game on smart phone even more than arcade racers on pc. Just remember it's a game that relies on sales to keep it going, so be patient and don't go on a shopping spree without caring, cuz you can get a lot without spending much.

Gameloft please do something about it or please tell me a way to troubleshoot this.

It happens on my husband's phone as well, so it's not just me. I can't claim packs and use it to skip gas refilling. I just finally started spending my money on this game, and now it's giving me problems. Fix this issue and it'll be 5 stars from me"

        "comments": [
            "I previously played when it was tied to Facebook. It was a good game then, but now it's a whole different game. The alliances, dragon rescue, etc. is fun. What ain't fun is the sheer number of dragons behind a pay wall (I stopped playing at the point they added legendary dragons), the amount pop ups before you can actually play the game with no way to skip all, having to click the \"feed\" button a hundred times, adds that come out of nowhere. There are a few more issues, but that's the majority.",
            "Love the game, but I hate that global chat was removed, we have chest cool downs, and I'm bombarded with ads. I used to watch ads for rewards, but these Yahoo ads are killin me. Now I'm even getting ads when I do basic things during the game, not choosing to watch the ad. Yahoo ads are annoying since I have to wait at least 50 seconds as well as periodically tap in order to finish the ad, but it was optional (watch ads for rewards). The game seems like it's dying out now..",
            "Right out the gate if you spend $30 and put it in the right area this game will be your favorite game. I truly feel that this game can be a game of the century but I don't like how everything costs so much money. if you're not careful you will nickel and dime yourself. It is an extremely fun and addictive game though and I wish they had it for console. There's a ton of variety a lot of different combinations of dragons mini games mini worlds and everything in between. Excellent game.",
            "So I love this game. I have since I was young. There are only one things I would like to address. The amount of ads u get when you first get on the game, maybe incorporate them into the game some way, but my whole family plays this also and hates the ads. Now I would like to suggest an idea. Therr should be a way to send gifts to your friends every day. Just one a day. And when u keep sending then it can increase ur friendship level and increase your rewards in ur gifts, ex. A dragon. Thank you!",
            "Love the game but as of the 4th of October, Australia started daylight savings and we accepted the fact that the event currency collection times moved from 4am, 12pm and 8pm (all EST), to 5am, 1pm and 9pm. It was an hour later, but we understood. However, recently for some reason, again the event currency collection times have shifted another hour later to, 6am, 2pm and 10pm. We are not enjoying this change and it is restricting us from getting the most out of the game. I hope it can be fixed."

            "My daughter wanted a pet very badly, so I downloaded this virtual pet game. It contains many things so it's not like you'll get bored. Ads are also less compared to other games. Some things are locked but they'll open as u reach a higher level. Nice game and I reccomend to the parents who's children want a pet.",
            "This game is the best there is a lot of things you can do. You can even bake bread which is the best. Not all games have the same thing. If you are a kid or a teenager this game will make you love again. It not only taking care him but you can also play with even in his dreams. In addition, you should download this game I had this game over 3 years now and I love it so if this answers your question if you should download. My answer is yes you should",
            "This game is so wonderful! I am ready to give it 10 stars if required! Bubbu is such a sweet and adorable kitten, I almost feel as if I have a kitten named Bubbu. And believe it or not, I just love all the animals and birds and even reptiles and insects! Execpt for cats! But this game has made me fall in love with cats! Honestly this is the best game I've ever downloaded! But I still don't believe that now I've started liking cats! A small advice for all who are reading this, just install it!🥰",
            "I've been trying every virtual pet game out there and this is the most detailed by far. The number of interactions you can have with the pet and his surroundings far outranks any other virtual pet game. From washing his hands to baking bread, it's cute and highly interactive. It's a bit hard to get enough coins sometimes bc the minigames don't really shell out. It might also be cool if he evolved. Otherwise, I'm a huge fan of tamagotchi and they could def take a page out of your book. Well done",
            "My 5 year old loves this game so I decided to buy it for her. I payed the full 7.99 especially for the NO ADS part and was shocked to see that my daughter kept seeing ads ! The game keeps sujesting ads to get different things in the game. It says \"no ads\"! I want my money back!"

Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "Actually it is almost more ads than gameplay. You have to watch annoying videos after each and every level and even if you need to repeat a level. At the beginning of chapter 2 the game crashed and was not able to launch again. I gave it a final try, removed the game from my device and installed again from the PlayStore. After that all my progress was deleted. Seriously... The gameplay itself is fun, just as we know it from every Cut the Rope game, but with these issues it felt unplayable to me. I played several Cut the Rope games before and always loved them, but this was simply a disappointment.",
            "Every time I watch an ad it gets stuk so I have to clear the game reset it and then it happens over and over again. I would be happy and rate this 5 stars if the problem is fixed. Thank you :)",
            "It was the best game you made until you began charging \"candy\" to play a single level and even to replay other levels, superpowers were a little understandable, now it's just sad to see a great developer succumb to the greed of microtransactions",
            "Way too many ads, most cannot be skipped. Way more time spent waiting for ads to finish then playing. The actual game is fun though.",
            "Irritating ads -- the worst. The game is excellent, yet it is limited by greed."

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

            "This game deserves a million stars out of five. The chance to visit another village is like visiting another planet. Mindblowing those villages are. That the game goes from night to day synchronized to the actual diurnal nocturnal quotidian circadian algorithm of natural time actually brought me to tears, in a good way. The spirit of the medieval forest is present in this smurfy app. Smurfeat emptor: October 30 2020. Paid $6.81 for lunar new year dragon and did not get it. App snapped off after.",
            "Played this game years ago and missed it, had to come back. Yes, there are glitches. Read up on how to manually save your game. The extra attention is worth it. The game is super cute, I found game support to be helpful when I had an issue. It's the only game I happily spend real money on, much to my husbands chagrin muaha! Love the development, the graphics, being able to create my village. Each day I look forward to opening up my village and working on it makes me smile.",
            "Super cute!! Look forward to playing with my favorite Smurfs everyday. Love the new updates and graphics. One issue I don't like is somethings are worth more money than the smurf huts, like how Fairy Prince Garth is normally worth $24.99. I don't think somethings will be worth the price we're paying. Other than that, the game is so worth playing or at least taking a look at.",
            "I wish i could do 0 stars. I had a huge village, including other locations like the grove etc. But It doesn't save anything after i last downloaded it. No new buildings, anything i place in a garden bed, it's just gone whenever i open the app again, even if it only been a few minutes.",
            "Excellent gameplay. You will not get bored if you play online or offline. Everytime more interesting things are coming...but for suggestion i just suggest that improve gameplay for story line and make more story thinkful and adventures."

I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",

I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",

            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

            "I really love this app it keeps me on track and on time. As the old saying goes better sleep means better work. I can use this app as a visual silent alarm. I also use it with my boys so they know when it's time to do their homework or to take a shower and get ready for bedtime. Great Job on developing this app. 👍",
            "Would rate 0 stars if i could. Worked just fine first couple weeks, absolutely loved it for the greyscale and DnD activation at night while charging. Made it easier to get to sleep. But now its not turning off in the morning and I'm missing important alarms and getting up late because of it! If I set it to turn off at a certain time so my alarms can go off, I expect it to turn off! Went from loving this to hating it literally overnight.",
            "At 5:30 a.m., while I was still sleeping, I was awoken by an audible notification (even though my default sound is set to silent) from this app, to tell me the app could help better manage my sleep. Waking me up from sleep with not enough time to fall back asleep before my kids wake up is NOT HELPFUL.",
            "It was good at beginning but as i noticed trends. Since the time google has allowed other companies give digital wellbeing it has got worse on Google devices. I am using Pixel 3xl and its Always showing wrong data. Apps which i didn't even open show time of 30-40m. Underpins the whole task of tracking activity and has lost its foundation as an app. Useless app right now.",
            "It would be nice if the app was easier to acquire (lots of phones are not supported by it, a large part of them probably never will). It should be built into every Android 9+ version. Other than that, the app helped me reduce my usage of some social media apps drastically - no more scrolling for half an hour!"

            "Directional pad isn't very good. Try to move straight forward and can only go slightly left or right of straight, so I just move forward in a bit of a zig zag motion. Got to the first big enemy and hit it once. After that, I could not move (directional pad disappeared completely), nor could I attack. I just stood there while the ogre attacked me repeatedly. Reloaded 5 times with the same result. Too bad, it looks like a pretty good game.",
            "Linear, not open. Colorful, but no real decision making. Couldn't even start the tutorial without encountering begging ads. Pretty lousy intro to a game, but typical of low quality, greedy game makers. Especially ones from China or non US game makers. This game is Korean, so all glitz, nothing original or deep. As we all expect I recieved the standard, insincere, automated reply from the game developer. It always the lie that shows the greed which dominates the gaming business.",
            "Went here to tell something. I did enjoy this game BUT I have this very annoying scenario when i get to duel or team pvp with players who are high ranked per se and it really sucks because it tends me, my character to lag or freeze or *my connection's poor or whatever even though I got a good internet service. Can we do something about that? I don't have other problems encountered with the game other than that.",
            "Gameplay is excellent and customisation options are great. Only one thing mars the whole experience, and that is the constant begging to spend money, the same offer came up 8 times in the space of three minutes. Surely the programming can be changed so it realises that once you have rejected an offer, you don't want it. IF I decide to keep playing I may decide to take up on some offers, but until then I cannot in good conscience give this more than a 3 star review.",
            "This game is good, but there are major problems. 1) Most PVP is pay to win I say most because if you manage properly you don't have to buy anything. But it really comes down to who is willing to buy more. They do try and counter this by giving beginners chances to get S rank gear. But fighting in campaign with S rank gear becomes a chore when clearing stages instead of fun and challenging. 2) Their team matching system is pretty wack. High lvs get put with low lvs which causes imbalance."

            "5 stars game is very fun looks very real fish are real fish there is always something to do challenge,duel,skirmish,battle keeps things entertaining. Keeps me wanting to play. Free stuff daily don't have to spend real money to advance. Keep up the good work developers!!!! Best fishing game on android. 5 stars across the board!!!",
            "Really love the game, however like most app games you have to pay to get anywhere. New Halloween event? Pay for a pass to get better prizes. New challenges, pretty nice, if they didn't run entire days of legendary fish that most people don't have. I'm sure there are more casual players that enjoy the game, that wouldn't mind being rewarded. Just a thought. Recommend for wasting time. Progressing or competing, not so much.",
            "this game was fun at first, but it is just a money pit now. The events are only attainable by those with fat wallets. And when the game goes down for more than a day, they give you a booby prize as compensation. Won't be spending any more money or time on it. My advice is don't play unless you're rich and famous IRL",
            "Was brilliant. Have spent over £100 on this game. It's a fix!! You will constantly keep spending money. You'll never have what is needed until you spend, spend and spend more. It lags, freezes and you lose items you have paid for for this. I have contacted them and nothing!! Or they state nothing is wrong. Completely disgusting. What a waste of money!!",
            "I was on level 59 entering 60! Played two months & was winning big, smooth clan, and BAM! Game Updated & started me completely over! Customer support wasn't available to help me get back where I was. Im not starting over at level 1 again. I put too much time n effort into this game. I was logged into Facebook account and Google! It didn't save my process! So I'm deleting the game! Good luck new players. It will happen to you. I was starting the Halloween theme! It really socks! No game 😕"

Now they say Wear OS is not supporting Google Workspace (aka G Suite) accounts which need a Device Policy. Why does this app then exist for Wear OS? How sad is that for a software company?",
            "Somehow this app does a good job of pissing me off. First, it doesn't sync. Second, it doesn't sync. Third, it doesn't sync. Fourth, it doesn't sync and fifth, did I already said it doesn't sync? And there's this annoying fact that it always uninstall itself. This app could be useful for my online classes but to be honest it is, well excuse me for the word but– trashy.",
            "What is this garbage. It doesn't sync, it doesn't work properly. Everytime i switch networks it stops the sync and now I can't attend my Google meets through my Gsuite account because this thing doesn't work at all. And then one day i rebooted my phone and it disappeared. I came back here to re-install and now it won't install. Such a beautiful piece of garbage. And btw...how can this app have a 4-star rating.",
            "since Android 10 update every few days after installing they sync stops. can't sync automatically, can't sync manually, can't sync over wifi, can't sync over mobile data!!! only re-installing the app is the only solution. fix this! this is a major major major inconvenience. I can't but use my University mail services so I'm stuck with this app either way. do something about it update August, 14, 2020: can't register my account at all. just can't.",
            "This app is worst, I tried to login in a work profile given by my university but this app redirecting me to log in again and again and now I can't able sign in and missed classes by this stupid app Google please think about users and update this app please fix the bugs this app made me hate Google apps I am not complaining about other apps but fix it this app is essential for college students,fix the problem"

            "Good app. Finally showing room sizes in the search results. Please add room size filters to save time searching. Hotel star rating often does not match the real rating, for example many 5 stars properties are actually 4 stars or unrated. Prices can often be misleading as they do not include fees and taxes until the final step of booking, and then the final price can end up to be significantly higher. Final prices should be listed at early stages and we should be able to filter by them too.",
            "I made a booking and then I found a cheaper price though someone else at the same property. I tried to cancel the booking and have the cancellation fees waived and when it came time for me to hit the confirm the fee waiver button it went straight to cancelled for $65.00. I literally found the other price less than five minutes later and immediately cancelled the booking.......smh. Bad Business.",
            "Terrible app. Too many bugs to list, and I couldn't even write them to tell them about it because the Google Recaptcha just kept asking me to select images over and over again. Oh, and after trying 5 different times to book a flight, I got \"reservation failed\" with no explanation. One time, when I went back to reserve, the same flight I tried to book initially went up $70. Oh, and you'll have to scroll back about 420 times to enter your DOB cause you can't enter it manually. What a joke.",
            "Frankly the app is really great. I usually check the googles and find hotels online. Then i open up booking and compare prices. 90% of the time the mobile booking app has deals and tends to be cheaper by $10 to $30. Not much but that extra $10 can go towards a meal or something else like the mini bar. I love it and i recommend to all my travel buddies.",
            "Fast to download, every bit of information you could possibly need is right there so you don't have to search elsewhere for numbers & dates & times, and extremely easy to use & understand. Very pleased with this app."

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",

            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",

            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "This app used to be great, recording steps, bike rides and transport with reasonable accuracy. Now it has thrown me out and forced me to become a new user and I have lost all previous data (even with the same user name) plus now does not record calories correctly saying I hardly use any when excersizing. Extremely dissapointed and need something better that does what this used to do.",
            "No stars if I could!.... Rubbish....Now stopped working all together except for the occasional heart beat record. My smartband appears to be working but the app is not up dating the info, which is a shame because I can find nothing else that works with my smart band, which is still fully functioning. So very frustrating.... 19-07-2019 original review, Would like to give it more but it no longer records when I am in the car, I frequently walk a 2 & half hour car journey",
            "Edit, October 2020: The last update deleted all my data. Sony have no pride. Don't buy their products. Original review, March 2020: I have been using Lifelog for 12 months. In the start I felt it was a good app. At the time it was certainly one of the best life-loggers that logged steps, sleep, weight and calory burn in a single app. Over time it has become more and more unstable, especially the last couple of months. Counting from the start of 2020 I have registered 9 days where the app did not count any steps at all. That means that the step-counter counts 0 steps approximately one day each week. This means that the statistics that shows the numbers of steps each week, each month etc is always much lower than you would expect. It is not possible to input manual corrections. If manual corrections were made possible the errors would just be annoying, but without this functionality the app is useless.",
            "Somehow managed to walk 4km taking only 338 steps... Seems the step counter is a little inaccurate! Two years later no improvement - now not syncing with swr30 or recording any steps or location data... Pretty much useless unless u want to track only your sleep! And another two years later, more of the same.. Worked for a bit, now not counting or syncing steps from swr30.",
            "Still tracking steps but not tracking sleep since I updated the app. It tracks how long I've slept but not how much light or deep sleep I've had, it just says I'm awake all the time! It's a real shame as there doesn't seem to be an alternative app so does that mean my smartband is obsolete?"

But the overall gameplay and idea is amazing, and the repeating levels dont bother me much, which is why i am 2000 levels into the game. 3/5",

They say my warenty should not be rejected. This is very disturbing my warenty status still showing its rejected since the beginning of July and no one at samsung knows what to do to fix the samsung members app?? This shouldn't be so difficult to correct.",

            "I really like this editing app. It has lots of features and I have found it mostly easy to use. I have used other editing apps but always come back to this one. It would be a great feature in this app to be able to save, search, or favorite certain presets... like the preset texts. Overall, Great App. Good job. Plus, thanks for all the cool things available with this app for free.",
            "This app is really easy to use, and has a lot of options to choose from when editing photos from various filters, to effects. There are so many things to do with this app, even with the free version. The only issue I have is sometimes a picture will become pixelated however majority of the time, the outcome is great. Definitely my favorite photo editing app",
            "You can do alot of customisation and there are presets available for free which are enough to get you going, you can make realy nice edits with what's there you just need to get creative with it. and there aren't any ad pop-ups, insted they're on the side of your editor and don't get in the way of anything which is great. But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",
            "App keeps crashing I have been using this app for a long time now, have had problems in the past but now it keeps crashing as soon as it's opens. So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still keeps in crashing. I have purchased a LOT of effects, so I really need this to work. I gave 1 star because of this problem, if you can get this working for me I will upgrade the rating.",
            "Bestest ever... Amazing app with ennumber of filters & effects. I've been using it for 3 years now and I love it! my all time favorite app. Easy to use and very impressive and the great part is that its almost add free. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

            "I love mortal kombat. I have been using this game for a while. I've reached level 47 and I've got a real bone to pick with the dev's. I have bought hundreds of character packs promising diamond characters, but have only recieved one diamond character. And no joke, I've accumulated over 100 characters, only one diamond(mk11 kabal). Come on guys, I'm ready to call it quits because of this. Please increase the chance to get more diamond characters or you'll lose my business. Thanks...",
            "One of my best games ever! But it often asks data connection, even when my device has perfect data connection. Please solve this issue to play nicely, as this thing upsets me more. Even after the recent updates, it still asks for a network connection. It wastes my time a lot more than the time I play it. This is annoying!!! And, to play it, I had to retry several times atleast for half an hour, even when I had perfect network connection!!!😢 This is why I gave 4 stars! Or else, it's of 5 stars!!",
            "It's not an overly in depth game... That being said, I enjoy it especially with the new auto functionality. To me it's no different than playing any card type game except this is a little more interactive . You still get to build your characters , you still get to watch Cool fight scenes. I really don't have any major complaints. This is a game that has been adapted for phone play. You can't expect a whole lot. But what you get is pretty cool.",
            "its a great game. and the quests for souls are a good way to save up for gold and diamond packs.....is a bit of a slough though. It also might just be me, but I thought in earlier versions of the game, the faction wars tier rewards for Ruby points (or whatever they're called) was a bit higher? Not sure. Otherwise. Great game.",
            "I like the new feature of being able to select my teams and save them is great so that way I don't have to change character after character to get a new team. Some reason now I can't even load certain teams without it unequipping the equipment cards and now I have to go back and reorganize and re-equip the cards back to characters. I would like to keep the freedom to put equipment cards for the characters I want. Its like one good idea, then you take a step backward with another bad idea."

So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",

            "Historically this is a great and useful app, but most recently there are a ton of issues. 1, it crashes time and again. 2, other users also say they can't save photos. 3, my saved faves folder has disappeared. 4, latest version didn't need to change, just needed bug fixes, but the new version has not got the same features. 5 iPhone version has nose slimming but android version only has contouring which is not that useful",
            "I love this app, don't get me wrong. But just recently whenever I create a look and try to save it, the photo would usually go to my Perfect365 folder located in my gallery. Now, when I save a photo I can't find it anywhere!! I tried Uninstalling and reinstalling the app... Nothing and it's very disappointing because I use this app often... Please fix this!!",
            "Too many bugs, too many ads, would pay for pro if the app worked. Can't find any saved photos now, app crashes all the time, the ads in app cause more bugs, very slow, very glitchy. Too much happening and very poor quality. I only use it when I want to change the hair color on my pics now cuz nothing else works or looks good.",
            "It won't allow me to save my pics and then be able to post it to a social media like before. I click save over and over and nothing. Its very irritating and hope you guys can do something to fix it!! It used to let me save and post and then they would all be in my \"perfect365\" albumn in my pics. This was one of my favorite apps. But this is so disappointing!! 😕😔"

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons.

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

For example, some of the daily challenges are impossible because of the balance card updates. But one bug that that makes this game way less enjoyable is the fact that I cannot see any of my friends online even though I can guarantee they are. This means I can't battle them which is a real bummer.",

And I love it . But what I dont love is this game, not getting attention . EA does everything for money . They dont care unless they get money . This game is nearly dead . No balance , no updates, no new content and probably will never ever come . Good game . Bad marketing",
            "Too many hackers are infesting the game completely ruining it. You might notice that certain pattern of players who draw the same cards in their starting hand every game without fail and always specifically draw the card They want again without fail. Recently I ran into a rustbolt hacker. He has flag zombie on the field and sumo zombie & that halloween candy zombie. Rustbolt uses heroic health and cut down to size. I have not proc'd his block yet so how did he use two powers turn 4??? Hacker!😤l",
            "Plants vs Zombies Heroes is a turn based card game. Regarding its strengths it has a multitude of cards to collect which in turn gives way to many different strategies. The multiplayer gameplay is interactive and us a good way to have fun in addition to improving your playing skills. The singleplayer campaign the game has provides a good place for new or returning players to master gameplay basics. In terms of the negatives the game is pay to win and very grindy if you don't pay for things.",
            "The game itself hasn't really received any new content and I come and go just so I can PvP with friends and now it's starting to act up. Seen other people experiencing this as well and now I'm thinking, even though it was updated recently, the game is being let go and will eventually leave from wherever you're downloading it from. I'll come back again if something changes, very enjoyable game."

I also noticed a glitch when taking a log, rock or car to a build or challenge circle. Sometimes it won't release the item in the circle. The turning controls, especially on the helicopters, could use some work too. But other then that! I love it! Needs more maps!",
            "Good game. With only 5 maps, unfortunately, need more maps to make this game more interesting. Wide terrain for each map, with so many mini games inside each of map. To bad we only get to hold 3 card slot, with so many out there to collect. Take too long to get another vehicle unless we paid, but all and all, this game make me want to play every time.",
            "This game is one of the best off road games and yes it looks better then you think too it has really good realistic sounds and lots of things to do and the truck you start out with is a some and sounds good it also has a realistic damage model on all the cars and all I can say is a game like this is hard to find on the play store it's like something you would get on a PC or game system",
            "Nice game, but it needs some simple additions such as adding some people to the game because I feel lonely in the game. Or I feel that it lacks some natural things, such as some animals, such as some birds. And make the weather in the game change with time. And something like day and night will make the game more beautiful. It misses some simple things, but those things will give more beauty to the game",
            "This games honestly got a lot packed into it for a free game and although the grinds do force you to become a grinding sloth it's still fairly enjoyable. no idea how I'm going to collect 300 let alone 2500 cards for a vehicle when there's at least 60 vehicles and you only get 5 or so cards for a vehicle at a time (and it takes 8hrs). would be worth it for a once off 6.99, even $12 purchase. Catch is, you're gonna have to cough up 6.99 every month if you want to try all the vehicles \"for free\""

            "After reading a few of the reviews, I was nervous about trying to update. Happy to say I had absolutely NO problem. I used to have problems with many updates until I realized that my VPN was working too well, lol. (Even with \"safe\" sites. Nord can suck and I'm sorry I paid for 3 years in advance to get a good deal, or I'd have dumped it ages ago!) I never know what update is going to be stopped until it is, so if you're having trouble and have a VPN, try pausing it then try again.",
            "I'm always a little hesitant about updating this update after reading the reviews each time. It seems this update always seems to be tied to an update with Chrome. I have not had any issues with updating to this latest version. It is concerning, when there seems to be no feedback from the development team, who put out these updates. I hope someone is making them aware, of all the difficulties people are running into. Someone on their end should always monitor, after an update is available.",
            "It's awful and won't update, and because of, google chrome won't update!!! Fix it!!!!... C'mon!!! Stop giving us updates that don't work!! And because of it, google chrome will also not update!!! Said before, FIX IT!! or stop doing updates!! And yes, I've tried possible fixes that others have stated, still no! Herd we are again, one week later and this app won't update thus chrome won't update!! Fix ur crappy software or better stop the updates since they don't work anyway!",
            "nearly every weboage opened using this. When scrolling down, freezes and \"shakes\" on Android 11/ pixel 3xl Would love to delete it. But I've got years of saved content in it. Which for some reason known only to the Google gods. Does not save in the full version of chrome. Why? If I save a site in webview, aka bookmark it. Why doesn't it save in chrome too. Doing so would eliminate more of the infamous Google duplicity. We could eliminate this app or chrome. Which are technically the same",
            "I can't even download the most recent update, despite trying for several days. Reading the other recent reviews, I see that maybe it's good I've got an old version. Not good, cause it's still been buggy as hell, but, better (maybe)? What's going on? I use Android so this is affecting my other apps badly."

            "App UI is very bad, first of all the app roll out should be like Netflix so that most Android TV's can install it. Amazon should discontinue this app and port the one on FireTV as it has the X-Ray feature and Video Preview. The Prime Video App on FireTV has a much Clean and Decluttered UI and is pretty smooth although it does have dependencies on the core apps of Fire TV as that App doesn't have standalone login. (Even though the specs of my Android TV are higher than the FireTV 4K and yet the Android TV app lags a bit)",
            "- does not remember series, season and episode that was being watched which requires cumbersome navigation - can't properly restart already watched episode, since it starts at the end and almost immediately jumps to the next - does not save state when app is going to background, preventing easy continuation -owned material not shown on the start page even when recently watched With those fixed, it would be a good app.",

            "This game is a very good game but some changes you have to make in the game. 1) I want you to give more routes to drive. like school, college, hospital. 2) I want you to change the sound of horn and siren. 3) I want you to give the mechanical shop along with fuel station to repair the vehicle. 4) I want you to stop more fire engine trucks in the depot which in the picture. 5) I want you to give the start,stop option like which you give in the 2 bus games. please fix all my needs.",

            "Awesome game. I think the developers are flat earth believers. Try going into the river and drive to the right. The truck goes upto a 1000 kmph. Looks really fun but you end up losing $200 game currency as the fuel runs out. 😂",
            "Great game, well payed in the game currency, but you need the street lights on the opposing side of the street, and an american map, and it would be nice to have different sirens, and to have a red and white lights, with a fire dept. Symbol you can edit please.",
            "Really good game, but I think it could be better if it had a few different scenarios instead of the same options on the GPS buttons but they should have different countries where you can see and use"

However, recently I have played for about 5 minutes and then get kicked off and it loses everything I did in that 5 minutes. Maybe its just me but if not I hope that can be fixed and if so, it deserves 5 stars Edit: Have had response really quickly, deserves 5 stars! Thank you...problem solved I think it was just me",

Yesterday it crashed a few times and was kind of annoying, but I forgot about it. Now, the game KEEPS crashing as soon as I hit the X for the first pack thing it shows you. I simply cannot get into the game and it is SO frustrating. Please fix it Ludia, because I know it's not my computer.",
            "The games nice. It's just that when I watch the ads that allow you to skips some time, it crashes on me. The ads completely stop working and the screen sometimes turns black. If you wait long enough the game kicks you out. Please fix this glitch. I wanted to skip sometime to quickly get my dinosaur. Last thing, anyone reading this, try to avoid the ads as they might crash on you. I have a S9 so it's weird how the game is crashing on me."

            "Its very interesting game. Also, such helpful team out there. I face some issues while playing this game and i emailed for online support. They not only solve its problem but kept follow up until i got satisfied. Its great",
            "I have always loved bubble shooter games, This time around, I'm starting all over and I still enjoy this type of game immensely!",
            "Made it to level 142, time to uninstall cant get past the level. These games are suppose to be relaxing not so stressful you want to throw your phone across the room.",
            "Can't even get to second level before been bombarded with ads, and ads at bottom of screen. Yes I know ads bring revenue, but there is a balance, between people enjoying the game few ads and get some revenue, or bombarding people with ads and uninstall (like me) and get no revenue. Goodbye."

Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad. But then it became clear that 3 stars for 100,000 pts and 3 stars for 300,000 pts is very significant . Not for the braindead!",

The version in paris where You can send angela Letters And sing with Angela. can we have that back? i Really. really! Like the first version way better than this. Its A Not Kind of fun game now The Update Ate whole of the game. I Promise you If You Change It. it will get more Rates. Its Not only for me Fun, But You to change your new boring game to the old",
            "I WANT THE OLD VERSION! It was so nice . Tom would sing with Angela ,chat with her,ginger would throw a flower pot on Tom's head,there would be an earthquake, a strong gust of wind,the would sing together, Tom would give gifts to Angela.I was awesome!but this version is just boring",
            "Listen here dude the old version \"Tom loves Angela\" was way better. This version is boring and you can see them kiss, hug, dance which is gross. I want to the version when Angela is on the balcony and Tom on the roof, and you could write letters 📝 to Angels and she would answer, also you would sing a song called \"you get me\". Do not install this game. Not good game dev. I have no idea how this game has so many 5 stars.",
            "It's a good game, But I want to add some more features in this games like Tom and Angela live with each other. They go out and we have to dress up them. We have to make food for them, decorate there house and many more. And I also want some action scenes that some thieves took Angela with them and we Tom will go on a mission to rescue her. Please add these features. 🙂",
            "We want the old version So the old version was amazing, And so fun. They could sing songs and chat (I would troll her) She was on a balcony and Tom was on a roof, there could be a earthquake and Ginger could throw a flower pot on Tom's head. Tom could give her gifts and stuff, And there was really fun games as well. This Version This version is really boring. All they can do is Kiss, Hug, dance and read cards. That's literally it. It's super boring, If I could I would give it no star."

            "It's one of the best dress up apps out there, there's plenty of items and (so far) there doesn't seem to be a limit on saved dolls. It would be cool if they added a way to sort your characters into folders of sorts so that it's easier to find a character you're looking for. Edit: After the last update I started getting adds on the top and bottom of my screen again even though I previously paid to remove them. Down to three stars until this is resolved.",
            "Oh my!This game is F.A.B,I just really adore the details!YOUR GRAPHICS ARE REAAAAALLY GOOD👍!!! I hope my reccomendations help!: Pls add the ability to choose earings,neclaces,sleeves,shirts,pants etc. and i hope we can change the colors! I want more eye designs and be able to color them+They can blink! If we could add like animations that make the hair look like its flying by the wind it would be cool! 😮 add poses and i wanna be able to make stories with this app,anything pls! #SORECOMMENDED!",
            "I really enjoy this app! It's fun, creative, and has beautiful music.There are only 2 things it's missing: 1: if you could change the colours on everything (eyes, clothes, shoes ect.) that would be great! 2: it would be fab if you could put your chibi doll in different poses, as I think the regular standing pose is a bit boring.",
            "This game is very fun it is amazing it's a creating a character it's just like God's club but very different than go to club I love it so much I love how you can like change the look of your characters so much but I wish they would add somewhere that you can makeup a name for your character but it is very fun it's a very creative fashionable game well not that fashionable 😂😂😂😂😂 Well download it if you haven't",
            "Great game so awesome game 8 year old girl so good I recommend you make more games like this ... I'm a fan of MLP my little pony .. I made a mlp chibi dolls so great hope you upgrade .. the game ..or make more like this game.. 😀😃👍👍👍👍👍......"

Help the citizens, complete collections, find Ectoplasm and get the grand Forsaken Abbey! <br><br>Fixes and Improvements<br>* Added a plane purchasing animation!<br>* Now bonuses are all in a separate store<br>* Fixed the bug with the Campus Park",
        "comments": [
            "4 stars only because planes can back into each other, bump into each other and sometimes go through each other depending on what planes and how many planes are in que. Also, making enough money to expand or upgrade is way too slow. The more I ply, the less I like this game. Getting what you need is really based on how much time you play the game at one time. Two stars now. This game is no longer fun to play. It's a chore.",
            "This game has improved it is still slow going unless you spend real dollars but now the bonus is that every 14 days you get one game dollar so there is the chance to advance even thought it is slow, it is now possible. Bad thing for me is now I am tempted to spend real funds to get to my goals quicker.",
            "I'm glad I didn't spend any money on the game for 2 reasons. 1)it really is not necessary to spend money if you're just a little patient. It does have advertising which you can watch instead of spending on the game. 2)I've got a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus which is an above average smartphone in terms of its capabilities but the game frequently glitches necessitating closing & restarting which is a problem. Worse is that the developers don't acknowledge issues when reported. It's fun & addictive tho",
            "Since the latest update I'm not able to use my own comfort classes, only the free ones in every few hours. There's no possibility to use mine outside these free times. Also hawk planes often get stuck at the end of the runway and I have to close the game to make them go away. Takes an awful long time to collect coins.",
            "I LOVE this game. It is so involved and there is so much going on that once you level up a few times and you've got say 3 ore more planes and a couple of helicopters, you can literally stay busy constantly collecting passengers, money, exp. points etc...... that you can actually \"play\" the game for hours and your eyes and fingers never leave the screen. The special collections are so cool!! The only thing I don't like about it is a cost a lot of coins to upgrade buildings, buy aircraft etc."

            "I loved this game... not anymore. The update reset all my lvls so now instead of lvl 100+ I'm at lvl 1... And you are forced to watch ads after every single lvl which on average takes a few seconds. So, in seconds it goes something like this: lvl\"2 ad\"15, lvl\"3 ad\"12, lvl\"2 ad\"14. This isn't a game that I used to want to give 5 stars to. Now, it's an app you download to watch ads. Highly disappointed and will be deleting.",
            "It is a very cool game and when I play it I think it is very good but the reason for me to give it 4 stars is of the horrible ads when you finish a level you have to watch a 10 second ad and if you lose again you have to watch a 10 second ad I will give it 5 star after seeing the result thank you 🤟🤟🤟",
            "🎃👻It's an amazing game despite the adds. I really enjoy it and I have never ever had any problems with it besides the ads because to be honest I don't really ever get any ads and if I do they are like 5-30 seconds. So I recommend you get this game and it's really fun and if you don't want any ads then just turn of your WIFI, if you do that then you won't have to worry about ads coming your way. So, what I'm really trying to say if your looking for a fun game to play with different skins...👻🎃",
            "Too many ads . When I open this game a ad when I close this game again ad when I switch to next level a ad God so many ads 😡 I prefer you to not download this game just a waste time and your Mobile's memory I have given given this 1star because I can't give 0 stars if there was a option to give 0 star I will give",
            "Advertisements after EVERY LEVEL are way too much. The concept is actually pretty cool but you spend as much time watching ads as playing the game. I would even pay a few dollars for an ad-free version but they want a hundred dollars PER YEAR to eliminate these ads."

            "It is a very good game, for when you probably worked on this for months or even a year. One thing I would love is where you can drive cars and drive through cities and housework missions, where you can go to shops if you want it more realistic, you can keep the tablet. Then, you can have other drivers with turn signals that work properly because some games have horrible drivers, I'm telling you. If you want to, look at my comment. Update: Okay, thanks for the respond, I like your game.",
            "This game is good for wasting time and is rather relaxing. I do however have some negative points to share... 1)the controls are awful. I have the sensitivity turned almost down to nothing and it's still super sensitive. It makes it difficult to place furniture as one small knock and the item is out of line again. 2)the same tasks over and over again. 3)lack of furniture colour and details. 4)dirt and rubbish don't always load in and is hard to find.",
            "Absolutely love this game! It's so addicting and I've been playing nonstop for weeks, my only serious issue is The very last house, the most expensive one, I've reset the game 3 different times and every time as soon as I buy that one house and move to the property automatically I can no longer leave the screen of the yard. I can run around the yard, but I can't open my menu, my settings, can't use any of my tools, can't open the shop, or even any doors to actually enter the house.",
            "Pretty good overall. A good time killer. I have a few critiques, however. #1)Add an option to tear down and/or put up walls. I want to be able to move where my windows are, or put in a door from my bedroom to my bathroom. #2) Make a search option so you can find what you need to put in for a job. I kept finding myself looking over the catalogue over and over again trying to find something. Also maybe make subcategories for furniture so it's easier to find stuff. #3) Make dirt easier to find.",
            "Very good game, easy to use and simply explained. Spent many hours on this game. My only 2 minor concerns are, when it's dark it's near impossible to find all of the dark, a torch option would be good. And also another way of making more money would be good, it gets quite repetitive when working on a bigger house. Maybe daily rewards would be good, or more money as you progress. Other than that it's a great game"

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"
