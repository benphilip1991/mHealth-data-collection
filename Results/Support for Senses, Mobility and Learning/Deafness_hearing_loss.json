            "Good test ....BUT just a warning. It will change the volume settings on your phone. For me it left them on MAX, so I got painfully blasted out by my earphones when i went on to listen to music after running a hearing test. Really not good!",
            "I really like idea .. but can it actually replace pure tone audiometry(although bone conduction not possible)..if yes then even paying a premium shouldn't be a problem Since we are using frequencies , what about monosyllables and checking speech reception threshold , speech discrimination score, sisi score, tone decay test. It doesn't need to be the exact thing ..just something that could be performed easily on opd hours as a screening",
            "There are no instructions! Do I hold down 'I Can Hear\" until the beeping stops or tap for each beep? Do I have to hit 'I Cannot Hear' once the beeping stops or can I just stop pressing 'I Can Hear'? When do I hit the Barely Audible button - when the sound is actually barely audible or is this just a badly named Confirm/Next button? Also I would prefer to use the Hide Results option but you cant pause. If I go into settings to select Hide Result, I miss beeps.",
            "Works good. But the results can be deviated to the better ear thresholds if the person has asymmetrical thresholds. For eg. left ear has severe and right has normal hearing , the app displays erroneous results in poorer ear. Any suggestion for presentation of noise to better ear to avoid its participation?",
            "This is wonderful, easy to read and use. it's results are closely accurate too. However I would suggest that naming of files should be enabled in the app to aid file differentiation. Thank you."

I personally beleive the \"cardio\" helps to link still intact hair cells in the ear to synapse nerves that may have been damaged. Definately worth the 2 week trial. Use it everyday, at least one hour per day. You should see a good result!",

            "It's a great boon to people like me, who need a hearing aid. This app is a great one. But off late, I changed my phone fro Lenovo to Samsung A10S, and I am not able to hear once the mobile goes on standby mode. Could you please suggest a solution?",
            "Excellent app - I rarely bother to rate apps but I felt like I needed to.",
            "This app offers a wider spectrum of frequency to base it's EQ on. With the Ear Booster hearing amplification application, you can calibrate your phone and effectively pinpoint even distant whispers ,when done correctly. Think of this app like the \"PREDATOR\" movie heat vision .Each iteration of frequency offers a different EQ to customize. You can use a Bluetooth headset and use the built in microphone physically located on the phone as your input location. This app is the best I've found yet",
            "I don't know if I can recommend this app, even though it works really well.  The things that discourage me is that 1. It doesn't appear with my applications, which I normally associate with dodgy software.  I had to look up the app on Play Store again and uninstall it from there.  2. It runs on my phone continuously, even when the app is closed.  Enabling noise cancelling activates the sound boost instead, and when I make or receive a phone call, it also boosts the volume of my voice and the sounds around me.",
            "it's nice that I can hear some things but I can only here muffled sounds even with said \"noise maker\" directly in front of me. Also, I attempted recording like it says possible. However, there are no audio files no matter where I look or any other sort of file that can produce sound."

            "It works as expected, nevertheless its accuracy could be improved by separating the various test steps with a visual cue. Sometimes one reacts with delay due to distraction or surprise effects, therefore a monitoring of the delays could give an indication whether its better to redo the test for a consistent result.",

            "The tests begin at an audible level, then ramp up quickly, making the result irrelevant. However, there's lots of analysis to put results in context. It's a very slick design, but the guy who ordered the screens should probably be doing something else for a while.",

            "I was impressed with this app! I expected it to be another cheesy app falsely advertising like the majority off apps out there. To my surprise it did exactly what it said, better even. I was able to hear ALL sounds, much better and louder than I figured. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who needs it.",

Perfect if you're looking for that, \"fly on the wall,\" effect on something happening a couple rooms away with a loud ass football game and music on. I could still hear a whispered conversation in that environment I just described up above.",
            "**My actual rating for this app is 4.75 stars** The app does an amazing job of picking up and amplifying the sounds in the area your device is located! Not only was I gifted with super-human hearing but it gave me a measure of clairevoyancy (predicting future occurrences fairly accurately) as well...let me briefly explain. Using this app I was able to tell, with practice, who was approaching my room, who was ordering food in the next room and who was about to enter the house.",
            "So, I guess if you're looking to go deaf by listening to all the high-pitched sounds you DON'T want to hear while not being able to hear ANY of the sounds you might actually WANT to hear, this app is for you. As a chauffeur for a limo company, I had planned to use it to amplify the voices of my soft-spoken clients when I am in the larger vehicles. Yeah, right! That will not work!",
            "At times, I use this app multiple times a day. I only gave it 4 stars regarding my timing because there is no warning as to when I'll get next to another device n I'm suddenly wondering about the loud screech that's blinding me. Not to often but does happen."

The sound is accurately reproduced and not garbled at all. Like every other hearing app, there is a lag of about a second, but this can be overcome by using a BT headset or plug-in headphones. With both ears covered, you don't notice the lag nearly as much.",
            "I tried other apps. This one's the best. My 91 year old mother spent most of the day in urgent care because she's lost most her hearing. Could not have a conversation and TV was so loud it would drive me out of the house. I put the ear buds in her ear and she could hear me talk in a normal voice anywhere in the house. TV is perfect for her on setting 9 instead of 40. She perked up and smiles. She's like she was 10 years ago. Thank you"

No confusion, excellent app.",

            "Less delay and fast loading than other apps, I would buy this app if it has an option for a floating button.. When im on netflix and my ears are on earbuds I could not hear my wife if she's talking, obviously. But i can see her saying something. A quick button to hear her is very nice.. i dont have to remove my earbuds.",

Hear Boost gives your ears amplified super hearing and recording ability to easily capture far away sounds and improve your hearing. Give your ears super powers. Listen and record up to 200x what your microphone normally picks up. \r\n\r\nHere’s a tip to get the best sound out of the app. Start with your volume down on your device then slowly turn up the microphone gain in the app. Then you can slowly raise the volume on your device to get a clean sound. The interplay between the two is key. \r\n\r\nThere are 2 separate in-app purchases:\r\n1) Unlimited Listening & Recording\r\n2) Use the 6-Band Equalizer\r\n\r\nBe good to your ears and start with the volume down. Slowly raise the volume as your ears can take it. This app can get very loud so please be careful. The ear is very sensitive.\r\n\r\nSuper charge your ears with an aid and give them a hearing boost. A recording and hearing tool for journalists, students, parents, the curious and anyone who wants to enhance their hearing.

There is no limit to recording. It will keep recording until you tap stop or your storage has run out of free space. \r\n\r\nWe suggest using wired headphones. Without headphones connected it will feedback on itself and make a very unpleasant sound unless you record and or listen with the volume down. Bluetooth compatible.

However, there's been a problem when I'm trying to keep the recording as a file to share it. Other than the sharing, this is a pretty good app! Thank you so much for this!",
            "Personally I quite like the app. I can live without the equalizer. But the biggest thing I noticed while using the app was that for devices using bluetooth it wouldn't pull audio from it but instead the phone itself. Presenting unnecessary sounds when held in a pocket or other spaces. If it were possible to input an option for which mic to use that would be fantastic.",
            "It does have good hearing however i would love to be able to find a app that you can actully hear what peiple ard saying that are outside or downstairs .bug if tou in th eff same room grest for hearing .",
            "Works very well as a broadband booster. People with hearing loss need more precision in setting gain by frequency it is rare that one gain fits all. Please consider adding capability to drag a gain/frequency curve using finger or stylus.",
            "Very effective in boosting sounds around you. Massive amplification which is adjustable, good noise reduction, (paid, but not expensive) equalizer, and voice filter. Works in the background! Requests: selectable mic input (phone, wired or bluetooth), and clarity about paid options (unlimited use, equalizer, anything else? Make it transparent and allow an option to unlock everything at once, with a discount)."

            "Juat trying it out but I know having audio on blast while talking to someone and/or walking around traffic is something that irritates or endangers yourself. Having an app that keeps you connected with the world is something that might save my life and will keep me in tune with my surrounding environment. So far I'm able to listen to my music and hear someone speak to me. It picks up on things as small as my breathing and relays it through my earbuds so I can listen to my music and hear someone.",
            "This app works amazingly well. It seriously kills all background noises completely & allows me to hear other sounds. Very impressive. Only downside which is the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that you can NOT turn it off at all. Exiting the app won't do it, closing the app won't bit even killing the app. Literally the only way to turn it off is to uninstall it & then I have to reinstall it again when I want to use it again. Please fix this please thank you",
            "This is good but is missing a killer feature, boost mode. If I wanted to I could use this as a hearing aid, but only with the current settings set to their absolute maximum. The option to go even higher would allow one to use this app to help with hearing in a pinch. Haven't seen an app with latency this low on the store.",
            "I was almost disappointed that I couldn't find any app that can produce ambient sound since the one that came with my A7 doesn't work with my ear buds and boom! I found this. This is almost close to the real thing. However a boost to volumes would be nice also, add the Bluetooth microphone options and make the sound match the frequency of it's recoding. Thank you for such amazing app.",
            "Does as advertised, lets u hear surrounding sounds while listening to music on your headphones/earpiece. There is gain control to regulate amount of background noise you hear which is nice. Only gripe is that the app uses the phone mic as opposed to the Wired/Bluetooth earpiece mic, rendering it useless if i want to be able to hear ambient sound while on the go while listening to music at the same time."

After adjusting each frequency for both ears, the app asked if I wanted to apply the changes to the devices. I tapped yes and I had to pull the hearing aids from my ears. The app had set the volume controls to max and I got feedback whistle. 2. The hearing aids were new to me and caused me to make high frequencies too loud. Using earphones instead helped me set up the devices much better.",

            "After the first week I have experienced zerorl problems connecting to my hearing aides, setup was easy and straightforward. I understand keeping the settings fairly simple however it would be nice for those who choose to have more \"advanced\" settings where have more frequency control and such. Would like to hopefully see more bluetooth features in the future. All in all a very good app and love the hearing aides.",
            "Update 9/10/20 - App fails to find Right aid. Swap batteries between devices and both connect. Battery level indicator ALWAYS shows Pea Green [Yellow in the manual] on both devices. Replaced batteries. App never shows anything but Pea Green until app won't connect. App might show Green for a few seconds with new batteries if the app is started within a few seconds after the battery door is closed. Without both devices connected, app is useless as it will not move past the connection screen. App version claims 2.1.4 but is more like 0.0.214 Phone app is difficult to adjust levels. \"Sliders\" jump and give annoying \"Maximum Threshold Reached\" message. HI has the most effect. MID and LOW, much less. Adjustability is fair. It takes a bit of futzing with EQ, Noise Reduction and Direction to achieve results. Aids annoyingly reset to Min and Program 1 if batteries are disconnected. Level adjustment could say L1, L2, etc. rather than just beep for levels 2 plus. Programs state Program 1, Program 2. Updated after 3 go-rounds: App is usable to configure and set various program functions. Completed the test on both devices, created profile. When I open app, no profile and it wants me to start over from scratch. The inability to remember devices is a pain. Having to depower one hearing aid so it can find the other is a joke in today's connected world. Really terrible application flow. Adjusting profile after completion based on age and gender makes no sense.",
            "Good concepts but improvements needed 1. Connection issues.. getting worst 2. Volume adjusting down randomly. 3 program is loss. Then a number appears where program icon was. What does this number mean. 4. Emailed support. Said they needed more info. If I had more info I would have sent it. 5. When all the above happens the hearing aids are telling me something. I dont know what because I cant hear. Why not have option for notifications on phone. The maybe I can give suppor more info",
            "I use the app daily with my MDHearing Core hearing aids, both right and left ear aids, and it works great. I love being able to change the program to suit my current environment, i.e. in a restaurant. One minor glitch I have discovered is that if your profile is established for both right and left ear aids, when you are only wearing one aid or if the battery is dead in one of the aids, the app refuses to sync with the one hearing aid you are wearing.",
            "So far no problem with the app. Sometimes a little slow connecting to the hearing aids. Very happy with these hearing aids."

            "It works now, but Make sure you get your earbuds out before you turn it off. My ears are still ringing from the max volume ad that came on when I turned the listen function off. The ad should either fade up to give you time to adjust the volume or the volume should go back to whatever it was before you activated the listening function. I did buy the no ads upgrade after that experience. But seriously this did cause a little hearing damage and might badly startle someone who is driving...",

The app description should state this deficiency.",
            "I thought it was gonna be a great app until I really wanted to listen to something. It only amps the noise within arm's reach. I was thinking it outta be able to track thirty feet. Maybe I can give better score next time",
            "Downloaded 5 similar apps, only this one is simple, reliable and clear, the rest either volume too low, delayed or echoing. Only problem is when the phone was rotated the app stops immediately. If without this issue, this is a 5 star app! Screen turns off the app still works, this is great. My 108 years old grandpa needs this with a Bluetooth headphones to have a normal conversation with us, loved this more than his hearing aids. Older people can use their phone with a Bluetooth headphones now!"

Normally, these sounds are at safe levels that don’t damage our hearing. But sounds can be harmful when they are too loud, even for a brief time, or when they are both loud and long-lasting. These sounds can damage sensitive structures in the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).\r\n\r\nNIHL can be immediate or it can take a long time to be noticeable. It can be temporary or permanent, and it can affect one ear or both ears. Even if you can’t tell that you are damaging your hearing, you could have trouble hearing in the future, such as not being able to understand other people when they talk, especially on the phone or in a noisy room. Regardless of how it might affect you, one thing is certain: noise-induced hearing loss is something you can prevent.\r\n\r\nWho is affected by NIHL?\r\n\r\nExposure to harmful noise can happen at any age. People of all ages, including children, teens, young adults, and older people, can develop NIHL. Approximately 15 percent of Americans between the ages of 20 and 69—or 26 million Americans—have hearing loss that may have been caused by exposure to noise at work or in leisure activities. As many as 16 percent of teens (ages 12 to 19) have reported some hearing loss that could have been caused by loud noise, according to a 2010 report based on a survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",

            "A good idea with plenty of limits that could be explained better. When one reviewer asked if the app can measure one ear at a time, the developer said it \"presents out-of-phase digits and picks up unilateral and conductive losses along with bilateral sensorineural losses\". I doubt most people would understand what you are saying, no matter how well they can hear. Please speak plainly. To calibrate the volume, how about encouraging users to lower the volume until one (differentiated) digit is no longer audible? Otherwise I could use a volume ranging from 50% to 100% and get vastly different results. Lastly, the app refers erratically to trained people and to professionals but doesn't define them. I recommend putting something in the FAQs about audiologists, Otolaryngologists etc., and how to find or identify a qualified expert (and avoid charlatans).",
            "Good ?!!! I only can hear in one ear and I scored about 43 with more than a one testing . Does it mean the other ear is damaged ?! I wish there is an option for testing only one ear .",
            "Don't waste your time! This is surprisingly terrible all it does output pink noise and the tones don't work with any headset! You'd think that it should work for all headsets and not just select ones. BTW trying to guess tones by there pitch is not a hearing test. A hearing test is based on amplitude of a pitch not how well you can recognise its frequency.  In response to the reply. First things first the message about stereo headsets is ridiculous all headsets are stereo name me one headset that is not! I'm a sound engineer and programmer the issue is not the headsets, btw I have tried about 20 pairs lying around the studio here, it is the programming of the app. What the message should say is a stereo enabled device is required, not headsets!",
            "- I would give more stars if It could evaluate separately right and left ears. - And because there is an option to chose your language but even though the speach is in English. So it's not understandable what you have to chose your language for? - Also, as you have to remember three digit sequence, the concentration or memory problems eventually could affect the results. - And, finally, I found an App \"Check your hearing\" which has many interesting features. - Thanks."

But, it loses one star for the timer function not working-I have missed my work alarm a few times because of this, luckily my partner has been there to wake me. And it loses another star as it shuts down when your phone goes to sleep, so I have to change my phone's settings each night to never switch off and keep it on charge. I will keep the app, but I am on the look out for another unless Beltone can sort it out."

            "In the end, the app worked very well. I only used it once for testing. I don't like that it asks for all your personal info AND that it assigns you a new phone number in order to use the app, which is a total inconvenience. Now, for important calls, (doctors, schools, hospital, Physical Therapy, etc.) I have to give them this number too. Do I tell all of them to replace my real number with this number or that I now have 2 cell numbers but to use the new number to contact me from now on?",
            "So far registration was smooth and easy. When i went to use the app afterwards and try to long in. It said i had to register, after i already registered. Even after uninstalling an reinstalling it still gave me the same problem",
            "I love this app, great captions. I definitely recommend this for the deaf and hearing impaired such as myself.",
            "great service if person you're calling doesn't transfer you to someone else. Most of the time, my calls get dropped when I am transferred.",
            "I used the interpreter once or twice, then went to the AI service as i was making calls with personal information on them. Ive only just started and its been very reliable. The tutorial on how to set up call forwarding was very helpful. My hearing loss was sudden and this helped me cope very well. I gave 4 stars instead of 5, as it has a hard time understanding people with heavy accents and through masks, and it sucks battery. Have a battery backup with you at all times!"

            "It's one of the best apps for hearing test on Android, I've been using it for a few years now. The developer finally released an update (thanks! it fixed that persistent crash on app closing, appreciate it!) My only gripe is with the calibration UI. The continuous tone calibration is basically useless, since it's hard to set the correct volume by up/down buttons as it keeps moving; it should've been done as a normal hearing test with subsequent value adjustments. Adjusting a test to another audiogram is much better, but the UI for it is very well hidden, and I'm not sure it works as advertised. I tried calibrating another device based on the previous I used, and the results are still widely different on the two devices. I also didn't find a way to store multiple custom adjustments (e.g. for different headphones); that would also be very useful.",
            "Using it in Demo mode, should really be called Uncalibrated mode. Using the same high quality Koss earphones and setup. Allows me to keep a progression chart and do tests after different exposure to loud sounds events. Suits my needs well.",
            "Having been tested several times by professionals (for tinnitus), I think this is a pretty good tool to check for potential issues, and see a professional.",

Reasonably useful for controlling hearing aids, but sound environment tracking function is unreliable because the app ceases to function frequently, requiring a restart. You won't know this until you try to change the hearing aid settings. I've used this app on both Android and iPhone with similar results. Doesn't look like this app is updated regularly.",

The app keeps shutting down my bass no matter what even my phone sits on the table. Half the time it works but when it changes settings on it's own I only know when I can't hear right. Don't like it",

        "description": "The ReSound Relief™ app uses a combination of sounds and relaxing exercises that aim to distract your brain from focusing on tinnitus.  Over time the brain learns to focus less on the tinnitus. \r\n\r\nThe app lets you manage your personal library of sound therapy files and allows you to create your own soundscapes from environmental sounds and small pieces of music. It will also track your usage, so you can see which sounds work best for you, and it contains some secondary stimuli like colors and exercises to help keep your mind occupied. \r\n\r\nJust download it and listen to it as you normally listen to music from your smart phone. If you wear ReSound® wireless hearing aids, you can stream directly through them; the sound you stream will be adjusted to compensate for your hearing loss.\r\n\r\nThe app is a tool for anyone who has tinnitus. It should be used in combination with a tinnitus management programme or plan set up by a hearing care professional.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\r\n\r\nReSound Tinnitus Relief offers two auto-renewing subscription options for My Plan:\r\n$6.99 USD per month\r\n$69.99 USD per year\r\n\r\nThese prices are for United States customers. Pricing in other countries may vary and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on the country of residence.\r\n\r\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. To manage your subscription, go to Subscriptions menu inside Google Playstore app. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Unused portion of the free trial is forfeited after purchase. All purchases are final.\r\n\r\nRead more about our privacy policy and terms of use:\r\nhttps://www.resound.com/privacy-policy",

It will also track your usage, so you can see which sounds work best for you, and it contains some secondary stimuli like colors and exercises to help keep your mind occupied. <br><br>Just download it and listen to it as you normally listen to music from your smart phone. If you wear ReSound® wireless hearing aids, you can stream directly through them; the sound you stream will be adjusted to compensate for your hearing loss.<br><br>The app is a tool for anyone who has tinnitus. It should be used in combination with a tinnitus management programme or plan set up by a hearing care professional.<br><br><br>SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS<br><br>ReSound Tinnitus Relief offers two auto-renewing subscription options for My Plan:<br>$6.99 USD per month<br>$69.99 USD per year<br><br>These prices are for United States customers.

            "I have limited experience with it so far, but it does what is advertised and is amazing. I especially enjoy the ability to create custom sounds and set a timer. There are other apps that I will be trying out, but this is definitely a keeper and gets a full recommendation for anyone looking for background sounds while they are busy, trying to study or relax and for those trying to wind down for a nap or a good night's rest at the end of a long day.",
            "70 bucks a year for a sound generator / music app that keeps track of what you've played in when you've played it. 84 if you pay monthly. Total ripoff, there is no actual therapy here that you can't get out of any other music or sound player. No notch therapy, no static or white noise generator mixed in, or any other methods use. It looks to me like trying to take advantage of some people's desperation.",
            "It streams nicely through my hearing aids but haven't tried it very often nor had much success using it for Tinnitus yet. I do use it to help me get to sleep along with audio books through a pillow speaker. The books play for about 15 to 20 minutes and I set the Tinnitus app timer for 40 min. Very rarely does the Tinnitus app stop before I'm asleep.",
            "Tinnitus sucks, as my stress levels grow so to does the ringing. I was at breaking point last night lying in bed at 2am awake. Then I found this app. I played it at low levels and managed to go to sleep 20 minutes later. This is a game changer. I'll be investing in some sleeping headphones so i can maximise this app. It's also inspired me to look closer at my tinnitus and seek a management plan as well as look for ways to reduce my stress levels. Thank you so much to its creator.",
            "Ignore the 1 star reviews this app is excellent. If you're getting worked up over the noise in your head you can't control this app can generate sounds that give me relief. Just knowing I have something like this makes me feel better about my tinnitus, worst case I could always pop headphones on for a while and zone out."

Pleased with the app, I've decided to continue with the app and paid for a plan five days ago however I have not received any credits thus cannot make any calls. Reaching out to support a few times was met with total silence. It's a shame that a seemly good app didn't live up to expectations. Cancelling subscription and will be uninstalling. :-( Update: Got refunded.",
            "So far so good. Not perfect, but I live in the sticks. Internet provides better transcription. I hope it will improve with practice.",

Followed the instructions and yet I'm missing calls, people are not able to leave any voicemails, it also say that my number is not a working number. And oh, your suppose to be able to use this app for messages(text) that doesn't work either. Customer service has reached out to me regarding my concerns of this app, all that was discussed, and suggested to do, (troubleshooting) still hasn't been resolved.",
            "It requires internet data or wifi to use including making calls that's big Noo!!! The app is a bit confusing to use especially the enhancements. The best feature is the booster that makes listening a haven for those of us with hard of hearing conditions. otherwise I wouldn't use this app and pay $10 bucks a month just for lacking features that just screech and don't have any idea what's changes have been made",
            "hearing was great but I had a problem getting phone calls through it would just make a dead sound when people called and couldn't answer it it's a it's a shame it really did help the hearing clarity",

The efficacy of the app is dependent upon the quality of the phone and the ear buds you are using. I tried multiple ear buds before finding a set that worked very wella with my LG Aristo. That being said, if there is someone that is very softspoken because their ears are hypersensitive. The Mic nor the app recognizes they said anything. Very frustrsting as my step dad does this.

        "description": "Q+ is a hearing app that provides you with an enhanced hearing experience. Q+ is intuitive, affordable, easily available and provides multiple listening settings for different sound environments (quiet and noisy).\r\n \r\nWith sophisticated technology inside, Q+ harnesses the processing power of your phone, giving you:\r\n \r\n* Inbuilt hearing tests calibrated for precision per ANSI standards\r\n* Intelligently-adjusted sound per hearing test results\r\n* High-quality sound enhancement by using the same algorithms as hearing aids\r\n* Wide bandwidth -up to  8000 Hz- for improved comprehension and clarity of sound\r\n* Automatic adjustment of amplification to reduce feedback (whistling sound) \r\n* Versatile controls for customizing listening experiences\r\n* Environmental noise reduction\r\n \r\nQ+ can be used with a phone's headset for improved speech comprehension and enhanced perception of environmental sounds.\r\n \r\nINBUILT HEARING TEST: The starting point for using Q+ is an inbuilt hearing test that uses a simple progression of tones played at varying intensities/pitches to get a map of hearing ability. The test is designed to be simple, yet exact, and is calibrated for accuracy per ANSI standards for audiometry. It intelligently performs audiometry and monitors ambient noise to check if the location is too loud for a test. Users who have access to their audiogram can enter their known hearing thresholds as a starting point instead of taking the test.\r\n \r\nQuadio recommends taking the test in a quiet environment for accurate results.\r\n \r\nINTELLIGENT SOUND ENHANCEMENT: Based on the results of the test, Q+ uses proprietary audio algorithms to process sounds signals according to hearing requirements. The algorithms have been developed after significant research and provide a clear, comfortable and crisp listening experience.\r\n \r\nCUSTOMIZABLE SETTINGS:  Control your listening experience in different environments. Choose from three baseline sound quality types (bass/midrange/treble boost), switch noise reduction on/off, and fine-tune the sound type by controlling how different types of sounds are treated (soft, loud, speech and distant sounds).\r\n \r\nADAPTIVE FEEDBACK CANCELLATION: Q+ performs adaptive feedback cancellation to eliminate whistling/howling sounds that emanate because of the high amplification performed inside the app coupled with close proximity of the headset mic to the speakers. If needed, you can choose to use the phone mic instead of the one in the headset.\r\n \r\nCOMPATIBILITY: While the Q+ app is available for all smartphones operating on Android 5.0 and above, it is currently calibrated and works optimally for LG Nexus 5X when using the stock headset.\r\n \r\nQ+ works most effectively with an Android operating system with a latency of less than 50 milliseconds (ms). For some phones the delay is much more than 50 ms, which results in lip-sync issues and a feeling of slurring of speech for the user. Android powers hundreds of models of phones, each with its own unique hardware. The Q+ signal processing software runs on a phone's hardware and must be calibrated for each phone with its headset to ensure that the app output is optimal. \r\n\r\nCertified and tested releases will be announced on our website (www.quadio.in), Twitter (@QuadioHearing) and Facebook (www.facebook.com/quadio/) web pages. \r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Before using any hearing correction mechanism, responsible self healthcare mandates having your ears/hearing health assessed by a medical professional to rule out any treatable causes of hearing loss and identify rightly the requirement for a hearing correction mechanism.\r\n\r\nThough the Q+ hearing test is designed to be accurate, results may vary based on the depth of insertion of earphones into the ears and ambient noise. Test results should not be construed as a substitute for an audiological evaluation performed by an audiologist.\r\n \r\nQ+ limits the sound output levels based on hearing loss but care should be taken to ensure that the loudness of the output is comfortable.",

Get hearing tested, and use devices prescribed by professionals.  Try this app to explore how apps can improve speech comprehension.\r\n\r\nWhen you first use the app, be careful not to increase volume too high.  Volume can be adjusted using your Android volume buttons.  But if you don't want to change your Android volume levels, you should use the Volume screen to set overall volume depending on the environment you are in, and use the Equalizer screen to customize for each ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss usually affects the high frequency range of hearing.  Hearing aid devices can compensate for this by increasing the volume on the Hi-Band.  This can improve comprehension of fricative sounds like 't' and 'sh' ('show' and 'sow' or 'table' and 'cable' are often confused, if you have age-related hearing loss).\r\n\r\nHowever, hearing loss may not always be at the high-frequency end, and may affect younger people as well.  Which is why testing is important, to figure out which frequency bands require boosting to compensate for the specific hearing loss in each ear.  The Hearing Aid device is then programmed to boost the frequency bands which require compensation.\r\n\r\nThis app provides a simple 3-band Equalizer.  Since it only has 3 volume settings to adjust, it may be easier for users to judge which settings work better for them.  Usually for age-related hearing loss, you will improve comprehension by boosting the Hi-Band on the Equalizer.  Other users may prefer other settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarphones/headset, Lapel mic, or device microphone\r\n\r\nUse earphones or headset for best results.  In a pinch, you can use the Android device's built-in earpiece to listen, while using the same device's built-in microphone - however, this approach will lead to feedback at higher volumes (the device microphone will hear the output of the device's earpiece or speaker, which is a feedback loop, which creates an unpleasant whine sound).  If you use an external lapel microphone, then you can use the built-in earphones on device to listen.\r\n\r\nIt is best to use earphones to listen, while using the device microphones to record.  Or use a lapel microphone, or USB microphone for better quality.  Whichever configuration you choose, test for latency - some combinations give lower latency (better) than others.  Usually this will give the lowest latency: using a headset (with built-in mic) or plugging a Y-splitter into the android earphone jack, and plugging in separate earphone and separate microphone into the Y-splitter.\r\n\r\nBluetooth headsets can be used, but usually have much higher latencies (bluetooth latency is high on android), so may be more confusing to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLow latency / Fast response (Oreo Audio)\r\n\r\nThis app makes use of the audio improvements in Android Oreo.\r\n\r\nIf you like the low latency quality of the app, please support by purchasing the app.\r\n\r\nIf you paid for the app, but are not satisfied, please click Menu - Contact to e-mail us for a refund.

In a pinch, you can use the Android device&#39;s built-in earpiece to listen, while using the same device&#39;s built-in microphone - however, this approach will lead to feedback at higher volumes (the device microphone will hear the output of the device&#39;s earpiece or speaker, which is a feedback loop, which creates an unpleasant whine sound).  If you use an external lapel microphone, then you can use the built-in earphones on device to listen.<br><br>It is best to use earphones to listen, while using the device microphones to record.  Or use a lapel microphone, or USB microphone for better quality.  Whichever configuration you choose, test for latency - some combinations give lower latency (better) than others.  Usually this will give the lowest latency: using a headset (with built-in mic) or plugging a Y-splitter into the android earphone jack, and plugging in separate earphone and separate microphone into the Y-splitter.<br><br>Bluetooth headsets can be used, but usually have much higher latencies (bluetooth latency is high on android), so may be more confusing to use.<br><br><br>Low latency / Fast response (Oreo Audio)<br><br>This app makes use of the audio improvements in Android Oreo.<br><br>If you like the low latency quality of the app, please support by purchasing the app.<br><br>If you paid for the app, but are not satisfied, please click Menu - Contact to e-mail us for a refund.

            "Great, amplifies good. The static cleared with purchase. But I did not give it a 5 because it still has a noticeable delay,even with purchase, not to bad though. When I put my ear buds in a person who is very hard of hearing, I doubt they could notice a delay because they can't here me with out it. This should work for the gentleman who leaves his hearing aids at home now I won't have to yell at him.",

And to those who say it tells everyone they have a hearing problem this is not true I've done it many times and it gives me the same result every time. But when my friend did it he almost got a perfect score and when another friend did it he found he had hearing loss.",

            "I saw a few complaints of the app lacking default sounds. The default sounds are definitely there. There are three categories: soothing, background, interesting. When you select a category you'll pop pver to a new empty screen with a + icon at the top right. When you push the + icon you can \"select from app library\" or \"select from your music library\". When you choose \"select from app library\" you'll get a list of 10 sounds to choose from. 4/5 stars for not being more obvious for consumers.",
            "App works very well with my new Phonak hearing aids. Helps me deal with my 24/7 tinnitus, suffered from combat. Regarding sounds included I found them in the App, so not sure why others are complaining. Tip: When you open the App it says under the Sound Type tab that there's zero present. But press the arrow on the right side, that will  cause a pop-up message that says \"get started by adding a sound\", press that and a \"select from library\" option will appear. Press that, the \"default sounds\" included with the app will appear. (E.g., Blackbirds, campfire, chimes, harbor, ocean.\")  Tip to Phonak: you need to make this App easier to use. Sounds included should appear on a menu when one first opens the App.   I \"hear\" a 4800 mHz tone. This sound machine app, so to speak, sends supplied or selected sounds, aka white noise, to lessen or eliminate the tone I hear. Oh, I get my hearing aids from the VA. This time, June 3019, I got Phonak Audeo M90-R RIC.",
            "Very \"clunky\" to use the app. Needs to simplify actions, some things need extra clicks or long presses with no uniformity. Had to run thru about 5 timea to get it to stop undoing what i had just done",
            "I think it's a bit cumbersome or i may be lazy. I've seen other apps work pretty sounds. I'm sure it's great just takes some fine tuning.",
            "On repeat, the sounds are not continuous. There is actually a 1-second silence which is very disruptive."

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemic🤍 God Bless🤍"

            "Well, it SORT OF works, I guess. I really wouldn't know, because I HAVE NO CLUE as to how some of the controls work. I mean, sure I understand \"Left/Right Ear Volumes,\" and, of course \"Phone Volume.\" I am glad to have known about 1 more control, which was \"dB Gain.\" It is really just about the same as the other volumes except that it has a real unit of measurement, the Decibel (dB). A whisper is about 30, while 50-60 is a normal, relaxed conversation. A jackhammer or a power saw is about 100-110, and Rock concerts, jet engines, and shotgun blasts can all be between 120-145. And, believe it or not, the loudest sound any human is likely to hear (and live to talk about it) is a Humpback Whale at a (very likely) permanently damaging 168 decibels! And if you are unlucky enough to hear that under the water where sound actually travels 5 times faster than it does through the air, you may well never hear anything again. And if do end up hearing anything but a loud hiss for the rest of your life, it would qualify for being a miracle.   WOW, did I go off-subject. Sorry. Things like that are just so awesome to me. So, yeah I would like to know what those other controls do, exactly, and what they mean, or are for. It is easy to forget that if you are in some line of work where you pretty much have your own language, it is important to remember that not everyone can understand what all this stuff means.",

            "Despite the hearing aids costing £3k, unless you have an iPhone it is a waste of time (certainly on my Android - Huawai - which is, a good phone) as it constantly drops out so doesn't work unless re-paired with the aids which is not always possible. It is about time manufactures did something about this as apparently (like Oticon) they are really designed for iPhone - they should realise there are millions of people out there who don't want or own an iPhone!",
            "This app since update has not connected as well as previous. I'm in COVID lock down and I noted it wasn't finding LH aid of a morning (RH was okay), checked battery etc. I was ready to get LH aid serviced. Then after I closing the app and restarting it, it found both aids and is okay. It is 7 am here and I just enabled both aids and it connected okay. Since update I have had to fiddle on a number of occasions and restart phone. Satisfactory connection is a cornerstone of this product - it MUST work, and work well!",
            "We constantly had issues with the app not finding the hearing aids. After two frustrating years we purchased a Samsung tab A and everything finally worked. Less than two months later a revised version of the app was pushed. Now we can't even use the new Tab A to connect. We contacted Bernifone by email and followed their instructions to the letter. No fix. So far all they have done is add a message to the download that the app may not work correctly with the device.",
            "When it works, this app is fine. But I cannot get it to connect to my Zerena 9 hearing aids for more than a day. Just this morning I uninstalled and then reinstalled it to get a connection to my hearing aids. I went to check the battery level just now and it will not connect to them. This happens all the time. I have to uninstall and reinstall it to get a connection. Is there any way for the developer to make this app more reliable? After all the money we pay for hearing aids, you'd think we could get reliable phone apps.",
            "Since the update I haven't been able to pair my hearing aids with my tablet. I causing it as a backup to my iPod touch when it needed recharging. Disappointed with the update"

        "description": "Tinnitus relief is an app designed for anyone suffering from tinnitus. \r\n\r\nTinnitus relief contains a fact sheet describing what tinnitus is, how common it is, possible causes and what might make the condition worse. The mechanisms behind hypersensitivity to sound are also explained. It provides exercises and advice to help you cope with your tinnitus in the best possible way.\r\n\r\nThe app includes guided exercises you can use straight away:\r\n\r\n• A 6-minute relaxation exercise\r\n• A 25-minute body scan, which is an exercise in mindfulness that also provides relaxation \r\n• A 12-minute “sleep ease” exercise that will help you settle down and sleep. \r\n\r\nThe more you do the Tinnitus Relief exercises, the easier you will find it to relax, and your tension and anxiety will recede. You will be able to concentrate better and a serene, positive mindset can take root. \r\n\r\nTinnitus relief will also provide relief for anyone with a history of tinnitus, but where the situation has become more troublesome for some reason. In addition, you can apply the measures in this app in preventive manner, to protect against hearing loss and tinnitus. \r\n\r\nIt can be greatly distressing when tinnitus first presents itself.

        "description": "How to Improve Your Hearing - A Quick Way to Boost Your Hearing, If you've been experiencing hearing loss, you know how stressful it makes some situations. Hearing tests, important conversations, and watching your favorite TV show can become an ordeal. If you would like a quick way to boost your hearing for events like this, read on to find out how to improve hearing quality.\r\n\r\nThe basic method is this: wear earplugs for a couple of hours before whatever important event you need to boost your hearing for. This will mean planning a bit in advance, but a couple of hours is very quick when it comes to improving hearing. Used in combination with methods that improve hearing permanently over several weeks, you'll be able to have both the temporary boost when you need it and a permanent solution over time.\r\n\r\nHow does it work? A couple of ways. The first is by cutting your ears off from sound entirely, which makes them more sensitive to sound when you take the earplugs out again. Everything will sound amazingly clear compared to before using the earplugs.\r\n\r\nThe second way it works is by the effect it has on the muscles in the area. Hearing loss is often caused by poor blood flow to the area, which makes the muscles in the area weaker and less able to hold the best form for hearing. Earplugs open the area up for better hearing once they're removed. If your ears have felt blocked up for a while, this will, paradoxically, make them feel less blocked.\r\n\r\nBe careful when using the earplugs. Always follow the instructions that come with whatever kind you buy. Make sure they're fitted properly, and don't stick them in too far. If the fit is correct, the earplugs shouldn't feel painful, and after a minute or so they won't even feel like they're there.\r\n\r\nThe specific type of earplugs doesn't matter beyond your own personal preference. If you find one material or shape easier to use than others, use that one. There isn't any major difference in overall quality between cheap earplugs and more expensive ones, so if you're on a budget just go for the least expensive kind available at the store.\r\n\r\nThis method will only give a temporary boost to your hearing, but the boost it gives will be very noticeable. Using this method to give short-term improvements to your hearing will make it easier to complete long term hearing loss treatments that improve hearing permanently, but gradually.\r\n\r\nIf you still haven't started any long term hearing loss treatment, Download our app to learn how to improve your hearing for good, starting today.",

            "so you ever have the urgent need to test speakers in a different room than the one you're in? (for me it is the bathroom and the smart speakers are in the basement) but I was able to use this particular APP to do that. (well test speakers anyway.) works well with all my various other forms of communication equipment as well. I'm currently very happy to spend 2 bucks in order to use this app, and then, [poof!] now the advertisements went away! Great app for a good cost: all the stars. 🤕😇",
            "Beautifully done, loved getting my virtual haircut... I will have to see if my headphones play from 16+ by putting them up to my dogs ears cuz I must be too old to hear it...",
            "Superb‼️👍👍👍... But please help me to unlock binaural bonus... Always error loading to play ad... Fibonacci sequence the best...",
            "The binaural test was fun. I was trying to test if one of the sides of my earphones was damaged and was giving lower sound than the other. Although this app answered that question but not with full certainty. If there would've been a more nuanced test which could help detect any disparity in the sound levels of both sides, even better."

Get hearing tested, and use devices prescribed by professionals.  Try this app to explore how apps can improve speech comprehension.\r\n\r\nWhen you first use the app, be careful not to increase volume too high.  Volume can be adjusted using your Android volume buttons.  But if you don't want to change your Android volume levels, you should use the Volume screen to set overall volume depending on the environment you are in, and use the Equalizer screen to customize for each ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss\r\n\r\nAge-related hearing loss usually affects the high frequency range of hearing.  Hearing aid devices can compensate for this by increasing the volume on the Hi-Band.  This can improve comprehension of fricative sounds like 't' and 'sh' ('show' and 'sow' or 'table' and 'cable' are often confused, if you have age-related hearing loss).\r\n\r\nHowever, hearing loss may not always be at the high-frequency end, and may affect younger people as well.  Which is why testing is important, to figure out which frequency bands require boosting to compensate for the specific hearing loss in each ear.  The Hearing Aid device is then programmed to boost the frequency bands which require compensation.\r\n\r\nThis app provides a simple 3-band Equalizer.  Since it only has 3 volume settings to adjust, it may be easier for users to judge which settings work better for them.  Usually for age-related hearing loss, you will improve comprehension by boosting the Hi-Band on the Equalizer.  Other users may prefer other settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarphones/headset, Lapel mic, or device microphone\r\n\r\nUse earphones or headset for best results.  In a pinch, you can use the Android device's built-in earpiece to listen, while using the same device's built-in microphone - however, this approach will lead to feedback at higher volumes (the device microphone will hear the output of the device's earpiece or speaker, which is a feedback loop, which creates an unpleasant whine sound).  If you use an external lapel microphone, then you can use the built-in earphones on device to listen.\r\n\r\nIt is best to use earphones to listen, while using the device microphones to record.  Or use a lapel microphone, or USB microphone for better quality.  Whichever configuration you choose, test for latency - some combinations give lower latency (better) than others.  Usually this will give the lowest latency: using a headset (with built-in mic) or plugging a Y-splitter into the android earphone jack, and plugging in separate earphone and separate microphone into the Y-splitter.\r\n\r\nBluetooth headsets can be used, but usually have much higher latencies (bluetooth latency is high on android), so may be more confusing to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLow latency / Fast response (Oreo Audio)\r\n\r\nThis app makes use of the audio improvements in Android Oreo.\r\n\r\nIf you like the low latency quality of the app, please support by purchasing the app.\r\n\r\nIf you paid for the app, but are not satisfied, please click Menu - Contact to e-mail us for a refund.

And i would give it 4 stars if they actually took the time to make different videos for phrases. I would give it five stars if it had quizes and more learning aspects.

        "description": "World Wide Hearing Foundation International (World Wide Hearing or WWH), a non-profit\r\norganization that provides access to affordable hearing aids and hearing care, has created a mobile data-collection application combined with a web portal for data aggregation to simplify carrying out the World Health Organization (WHO) hearing loss prevalence studies. The WWH App is Android-based, free of charge and can be used both online and offline to capture patient data using the WHO hearing loss data collection form. \r\n\r\nBy replacing the traditional paper-based data collection system with a mobile, Android-based application, prevalence studies can be conducted more time- and cost-effectively by reducing the need for manual data entry and transcription. Furthermore, the web-based administrator portal enables researchers and/or project leads to track progress and data collection in real time.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION\r\n\r\nThe WWH app uses the latest version of the WHO data collection form for hearing loss\r\nprevalence studies. This data collection form includes the following sections:\r\n\r\n- Consent form\r\n- Patient history questionnaire\r\n- Hearing examination\r\n- Tympanometry\r\n- Ear examination\r\n- Causes of hearing loss/recommended action questionnaires.\r\n\r\nAll of these sections can be filled out on a single Android device or by different team members on multiple devices. If the devices have an active internet connection during the field tests, the app will sync data between the different Android units, giving the different team members access to the previously recorded data from other devices. If internet is not available during field tests, tested persons will be given the same Patient ID on different devices so that the datasets can be matched in the backend.\r\n\r\nThe hearing examination section gives three different options for data entry:\r\n1. Otoacoustic Emission (OAE) test for children up to five years of age\r\n2. For people aged five years and older:\r\n       - Manual data entry of hearing thresholds from any audiometer.\r\n3. For people aged five years and older:\r\n       - Automatic data entry thanks to a third-party, Android-based hearing threshold\r\napplication, such as HearTest. Currently, the WWH app can automatically integrate data collected with HearTest.\r\n       - HearTest is a threshold-seeking hearing loss app created by HearX, a South\r\nAfrican software company. When using the hearing threshold app option, the\r\nHearTest external app is launched and a hearing test can be performed. The\r\nresults from this hearing test app are automatically imported into the GHLD app. Any other test similar to HearTest could be used.\r\n\r\nAfter syncing the mobile devices with the internet, the data-collection progress can be\r\ninstantaneously observed through the connected web portal. For easy and prompt data\r\nanalysis, the collected raw data can be downloaded daily from the data server.

        "descriptionHTML": "World Wide Hearing Foundation International (World Wide Hearing or WWH), a non-profit<br>organization that provides access to affordable hearing aids and hearing care, has created a mobile data-collection application combined with a web portal for data aggregation to simplify carrying out the World Health Organization (WHO) hearing loss prevalence studies. The WWH App is Android-based, free of charge and can be used both online and offline to capture patient data using the WHO hearing loss data collection form. <br><br>By replacing the traditional paper-based data collection system with a mobile, Android-based application, prevalence studies can be conducted more time- and cost-effectively by reducing the need for manual data entry and transcription. Furthermore, the web-based administrator portal enables researchers and/or project leads to track progress and data collection in real time.<br><br>APPLICATION<br><br>The WWH app uses the latest version of the WHO data collection form for hearing loss<br>prevalence studies. This data collection form includes the following sections:<br><br>- Consent form<br>- Patient history questionnaire<br>- Hearing examination<br>- Tympanometry<br>- Ear examination<br>- Causes of hearing loss/recommended action questionnaires.<br><br>All of these sections can be filled out on a single Android device or by different team members on multiple devices. If the devices have an active internet connection during the field tests, the app will sync data between the different Android units, giving the different team members access to the previously recorded data from other devices. If internet is not available during field tests, tested persons will be given the same Patient ID on different devices so that the datasets can be matched in the backend.<br><br>The hearing examination section gives three different options for data entry:<br>1. Otoacoustic Emission (OAE) test for children up to five years of age<br>2. For people aged five years and older:<br>       - Manual data entry of hearing thresholds from any audiometer.<br>3. For people aged five years and older:<br>       - Automatic data entry thanks to a third-party, Android-based hearing threshold<br>application, such as HearTest. Currently, the WWH app can automatically integrate data collected with HearTest.<br>       - HearTest is a threshold-seeking hearing loss app created by HearX, a South<br>African software company. When using the hearing threshold app option, the<br>HearTest external app is launched and a hearing test can be performed. The<br>results from this hearing test app are automatically imported into the GHLD app. Any other test similar to HearTest could be used.<br><br>After syncing the mobile devices with the internet, the data-collection progress can be<br>instantaneously observed through the connected web portal. For easy and prompt data<br>analysis, the collected raw data can be downloaded daily from the data server. The<br>administrator web portal allows not only to track the progress of the study, but also to set up the study’s test clusters. The administrator portal can be accessed at:<br>https://globalhearingloss.org.<br><br>For information and user accounts, please contact: ghld-support@wwhearing.org.",

        "title": "TINNITUS TREATMENTS - Pulsatile Tinnitus",
        "description": "Though many may suffer with the symptoms, there are also many who do not know the medical term or wonder just what is tinnitus? In simple terms, this refers to the noise that can be heard inside the ear or head of the affected person. The sound is described as ringing, wheezing, buzzing, and other mostly high-pitched, shrill and repetitive notes. For some, the noise is heard periodically; for others, it is heard constantly without pause or cessation.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no actual loss of hearing in tinnitus, the repetitive and constant sounds distracts the person from clearly perceiving or interpreting the sounds from his/her surroundings. For people with worst cases, tinnitus provides them virtually no quiet moment during all waking hours, and even cause them difficulty in getting a decent good night's sleep.\r\n\r\nTinnitus can greatly affect the quality of life of the person suffering from it. Normal activities, even something as simple as walking on the street, can be severely limited and risky due to the difficulty in focusing and cognitive ability brought about by the distracting noises. On a day-to-day basis, tinnitus causes headaches, dizziness, lack of sleep, and plain hopelessness at having to endure such conditions that are seemingly without cure.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the social, professional and personal relationships of a person with tinnitus is also limited, since interacting with other people requires clearly understanding and correctly interpreting nuances in verbal and interpersonal communications. Career choices can be extremely narrowed down, as important professional skills, such as ability to focus and to follow instructions, can be hindered by the auditory distractions caused by tinnitus.

        "descriptionHTML": "Though many may suffer with the symptoms, there are also many who do not know the medical term or wonder just what is tinnitus? In simple terms, this refers to the noise that can be heard inside the ear or head of the affected person. The sound is described as ringing, wheezing, buzzing, and other mostly high-pitched, shrill and repetitive notes. For some, the noise is heard periodically; for others, it is heard constantly without pause or cessation.<br><br>While there is no actual loss of hearing in tinnitus, the repetitive and constant sounds distracts the person from clearly perceiving or interpreting the sounds from his/her surroundings. For people with worst cases, tinnitus provides them virtually no quiet moment during all waking hours, and even cause them difficulty in getting a decent good night&#39;s sleep.<br><br>Tinnitus can greatly affect the quality of life of the person suffering from it. Normal activities, even something as simple as walking on the street, can be severely limited and risky due to the difficulty in focusing and cognitive ability brought about by the distracting noises. On a day-to-day basis, tinnitus causes headaches, dizziness, lack of sleep, and plain hopelessness at having to endure such conditions that are seemingly without cure.<br><br>Likewise, the social, professional and personal relationships of a person with tinnitus is also limited, since interacting with other people requires clearly understanding and correctly interpreting nuances in verbal and interpersonal communications. Career choices can be extremely narrowed down, as important professional skills, such as ability to focus and to follow instructions, can be hindered by the auditory distractions caused by tinnitus. Working in the fields of construction and infrastructure, machinery operations, and occupations with hazardous environments are also often crossed out from workplace possibilities.<br><br>Holistic methods of approaching tinnitus is said to help people manage daily activities, boost their health, and improve their quality of life.

I sure hope not because people that are HARD of hearing I'm sorry but we don't get social security benefits & most insurance do not cover.Therefore how can one's hearing loss be registered by their social security number. Only people with a decent amount of money can get services. If I find this issue on this app & it's verification is not done through the right link I will report this app not just through play store but also to gov",
            "I cannot use this app because it scares me why do you need a social security number that is like super flipping sketchy. Like just why if you can answer my question and prove that you're not sketchy I'll change my review but I don't think you need my social security number but this how you get your info stolen by wannabe hacker. I'm just saying I will change my review if you prove to me that you're not sketching but until then I don't trust this app.",

Inaccurate on the S9+, but it screeches and uses no permissions; good enough.",

            "It's a good application to search the song title which you're hearing from radio or television. In some songs, it also has synchronization lyrics that match up with the song that playing. You can also search for song title that always in your mind by singing to it. Even if you forget the lyrics, it can do the seach by your humming. Unfortunately, it doesn't have many Indonesian song references.",
            "Was much better in the past. Could not find \"Waiting for love\". After some time I remembered the name (obviously) and checked, if I did the melody wrong. Tried various parts with different styles of humming/singing, but no use. I remember this being a straightforward app in the past that could even find some more exotic anime songs. Also, the UX got worse. Why did I paid money on that app, when it's showing me big nasty ads during my search? Please find your way back to your roots!",
            "Great app, I use it on a regular basis to identify songs when streaming. October 2020, I just needed customer support to make a change to my account, they were incredibly helpful, efficient and quick. I can't say enough to good about the support, thanks.",
            "Great app, able to recognize songs even from a far distance. but i wish it had some sort of a \"running in bachground\" button or sth like that so that the user was able to recognise music being played on his/her own cell phone, the sad thing is that the app isonly usefull for external music recognition and there is no way for it to work in the background when you jump from it into another app such as instagram",
            "I love Soundhound. No more pulling my car over quickly to find pen & pencil to write partial lyrics down or artist. I even called the radio stations if I didn't have a clue so they could tell me what just played. There's been upgrades to cell phones that I could now record etc. But Soundhound is safer for me driving I make sure it's on the screen on my phone as I leave. I wish it could be installed on my Amazon Tablet but they dont allow it or my HP Computer where Google Play store wont allow."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

        "description": "Enjoy music with your favorite player in a highly customizable way with a 7-31 band equalizer, multiple sound presets, balance and pre-gain volume. \r\n\r\nChoose between 7, 11, 15, 21 or 31 bands for the equalizer - depending on how much precision you need.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to adjust uneven headphones with different frequency and volume output - or compensate a hearing loss - this app is for you.  \r\n\r\nThe ability to pinpoint a frequency band for a particular ear/side makes SpotEQ unique.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n- 31 bands (choose down to 7 bands EQ)\r\n- Choose Joined or Separate sides EQ configuration\r\n- Multiple presets\r\n- Save your own presets\r\n- Works in the background, for long-running audio sessions\r\n- Great for compensating sound differences in headphones\r\n- Balance an uneven hearing impairment, right/left ear\r\n- Boost bass or clarify treble\r\n- Set extra loudness with the pre-gain volume\r\n- Volume control directly from notification\r\n- Visualizer\r\n- Works on Android 9 (Pie) and up\r\n- Tested with several music apps. Some works directly, but some require manual activation of external/system EQ in their settings. Some apps do not currently work at all. See: https://sites.google.com/view/spoteq-musicapps\r\n\r\nInstructions for best results\r\n1. It's safest to UNINSTALL all other Equalizer apps\r\n(There might be exceptions but many problems arise from having multiple apps using audio effects)\r\n\r\n2. Press ENABLE in SpotEQ\r\nYou will see a small notification indicating the app is working in the background (pressing the notification will open SpotEQ again).\r\n\r\n3. RESTART PLAYER APP and play music\r\nFirst try Google Play Music, Spotify or YT Music. Some apps will connect and you will see the player's icon. Other apps may be still be used, but some need activation in their settings.\r\n\r\n4. CONFIGURE the equalizer\r\nAdjust each ear EQ with Separate channels. Set a Preset or configure individual bands for your needs. It might be helpful to lower the Pre-gain when using the EQ with some Bluetooth headphones. To be able to hear the effect of the highest and lowest frequency bands you will need great headphones and hearing capabilities.\r\n\r\n5. IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS, If an app breaks the audio connection, try reopen SpotEQ and then reload the sound app. If not working, try to completely restart SpotEQ and/or the player app a few times (close/swipe away). If nothing works try to power off and reboot your device after uninstalling all other audio effect apps. Sometimes the Android audio engine needs a reset.\r\n\r\nDo not unlock features before you managed to connect your music player.\r\n\r\nFix bad headphones\r\nIf you have bad or broken headphones/earphones where the sound is uneven in left and right ear, you should be able to compensate for this by using this app. Some headphones may sound better and avoid distortions if you use the pre-gain to lower the volume while adjusting the equaliser.\r\n\r\nImprove your music experience without a hearing aid\r\nIf you have a hearing impairment and are using a hearing aid in your daily life, you can try to compensate the sound with this app. Just adjust both left and right side frequency bands, and depending on your specific hearing loss you might find a setting that hits your sweet spot for listening to Spotify without your hearing aid! Consulting your audiologist or audiogram is advisable. Sometimes a simple volume balance to left or right side can do wonders.\r\n\r\nThank you for trying out SpotEQ!

Being able to set my headphones to the EXACT audio profile for each of my ears is amazing. I have watched all the ads & unlocked all the features. I would pay money, if the option existed! It has truly changed my phone, for the better. My only compliant is that the equalizer doesn't apply to all of the apps, only music. I wish it could work with videos & games.

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I'd recommend a way to disconnect the headphones from the app, or maybe see what your headset is connected to, or set priority of connection. Often I connect to my pc and phone. Use the connection to my pc all day then want to watch netflix on my phone in bed. Guess what, pc is still in control, but you can't kill the connection from the app, so I have to run down to my desktop or I can't hear my phone.",
            "I just bought the Evolve 75e product. Not sure why it isn't supported on this app. Would be nice if it would be so I could update firmware and manage my device. The product is great, great sound and easy to setup and use. Update: In the app if you don't connect a device you can't get into the about section of the app, or at least I am not seeing any way to get to about.",
            "After rocking the Active 65t I bought the 75t this summer. Love them, and since a week there's Active Noise Cancelation too! The app is great and has improved massively, less crashes and like every other earphone maker should have: an equalizer! One thing I'd like to suggest: There are a few default \"Moments\", like My Moments, Commute and Focus. I'd like to be able to have different ANC profile and attach them to the different Moments. In my home the noise is different from the noise in my car, so is it possible to add custom ANC profiles to the different Moments? That would be awesome! Keep up the great work! That's why I didn't switch to other headphones/earbuds ;-)",
            "Jabra Elite 85h: Connection was very easy and fast. The app has a neat and tidy design. All options are easily accessible and understandable. The EQ works well and I love the option to be able to turn off the Voice-Playback when changing modes. I haven't experienced any problems so far. Will update this review if and when necessary.",
            "Since the last update when I open the app is stuck on the \"choose your headset from the list\" screen. I choose my headset (75t) and go to Bluetooth settings (where they are already paired). I close the app and open again and im back on the menu to choose headset with no way back to the welcome page. Iv tried reinstalling and repairing. Tried with my second phone with no issues."

At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Where it could stand out is with the speech to text, which works well but it's limited to only 10 minutes of transcription. WHY?! Look for the APK of the Google Recorder and sideload and use that instead.",
            "The recording process is fine, even though I wouldn't mind having an option to record in an uncompressed WAVE format. Also would be nice to be able to replay my recordings as a playlist through the app itself, because as of now I have to use a third-party app for that.",
            "Great voice recorder app. Unlike the other ones, this one does not have ads. And this is made by Samsung which is even better. Highly recommend if your searching for a voice recorder.",
            "This was built well. This app has utilized both microphones (top and bottom) for their specialties. Interview (2 way mocs) mode and regular (1 mic) mode."

            "So fun but death by ads. I paid for the premium, I paid to unlock the extra levels. The premium was a joke, the ads keep coming. If you want to open a chest, watch an ad. Ad after ad after ad. Horribly frustrating experience. I'm done playing. I can't compete with the pay to win or the AI and they have payed a massive amount. So much potential, so far behind. I know developers need to make money but the trade-off is the customer should feel satisfied, not cheated. Uninstalling. Sad retort Z.W.",
            "Enjoyable but man those ads. They push \"sales\" and make you watch ads to do almost anything if you don't want to wait 12 hrs to get your energy back up. Tone down the ads and constant \"offers\" and I would actually be more likely to pay something. Due to the ads I actually have negative opinions on games I have never played before since you can only see the same ads over and over so often before getting a bad opinion.",

I have pay few bucks for an apps but with this pay to win games, I don't think I will able to spend any anount to this game. Today, the games cannot load. just stop at loading page. hope there is an update for me to tickle win by pay player ^.^",
            "Good Game, but poor balance mechanic. Some fights are so lop sided I feel bad for who I fought. Some others the enemy kills you before you even launch your first attack.

            "Great idea and simple\\straightforward interface. My only gripe would be that 16k and 20k are non-existent when played. I tested my headphones (and my own ears) with a few different resources and they are definitely capable of reproducing (and hearing) these frequencies.",
            "Would be nice to listen to tone again after submit answer. Also some tones do not play well even through good headphones, and that other audio apps do play those tones. Eg. 16k, 30-50hz",
            "So far this has been the best tone identification quiz for android I've found. If you could change the interface to be a little more user friendly it would be a 5 star app for sure. Galaxy S3",
            "The only thing it needs is to let you chose between notes and frequencies, and it would be great if you had a way to track progress (and maybe limit the questions in one quiz so you can get a percentage for what you get right). Other than that is a great simple app that does exactly what it says it will.",
            "Really great app, produces full bandwidth of tones 20-20k in 1/3rd 8ve bands, only issue is on my galaxy gio (running cm7) sometimes it wont produce tones all i need to do to fix is start a new quiz tho"

            "A very user friendly app and exceptionally efficient. I've been using Snapseed for quite sometime now. However, over the last one month, I've been encountering an issue, whereby I'm unable to add borders to photos using the 'EXPAND' option. This issue didn't exist earlier. Please look into the bug, it would be really helpful. Otherwise, Snapseed is my favourite photo editing app!",
            "The experience of working with snapseed is really good. But I would like to share something with snapseed creator's. I think snapseed should add a feature like remembering the last edits for a long period like for a month or two. It would give a better experience to the user's. Her in this update it's like if you have edited a pic then again you come you'll have that Last edit but if you have edited it in the new way you'll not be able to use the last edit again,it will no longer be available.",
            "Overall the app is great, however I noticed that average ratings don't really draw developers attention, hence the 1*. Some basic tools like invert colour are highly desirable, but missing. This is the main image editor that i am using and i'd love it to be more complete, to eliminate the need of another one."

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "One ear is always out. I don't know if it's the app or the actual earbuds but I very rarely automatically get both working at the same time, either the right works and the left doesn't or vice versa. It's official, I hate this even more. The left ear is always out, it doesn't automatically connect to things it was previously connected to. I had a pair of Bose SoundSport which I loved, they took two input, once I'd connected a device as soon as I walked by it it would pick it up. These suck",
            "Honestly, these are the worst ear buds I have ever used. I have previously used two cheap ($20-40) wireless buds and they were better than these. Originally had problems with the buds cutting out for 1 second with loud static. Then I completely lost the left bud. No audio would come from it and when outside the case, it wasn't detected. I tried to reset the buds and unpair in hopes of fixing it, but now I cannot even connect the buds via Bluetooth to my Galaxy s10, my iPad tablet, or my PC. Bad.",
            "It is very useful. It's more useful than attempting to use the buds without the app. The app was optional, but with it, I have full functionality and constant updates which is retained within the buds. So, when I switch them to be used on my PC, the options I have selected still works on my PC!",
            "Was very excited to get these and as soon as I did, my right ear bud hasn't been working. Tried everything to fix it and it's updated to the newest firmware and still nothing. These have the potential to be great but based on the reviews by others it seems they're far from great. Very disappointed, wouldn't recommend buying these until they fix this issue.",
            "They've had an update available for a month and it just never installs (no way to manually force the update). The right bud drains twice as fast as the left. The touch controls sometimes don't function. So far a massive waste of money. Edit: I've done a factory reset, got the update to work (following the ridiculous update method that can't be explained in less than a paragraph). I still believe this is an unfinished product but I'll follow up if the other problems resolve."

I like it, it's easy to use, but I just can't trust it anymore.",
            "Potentially a great document creator comparable to Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Notepad. But it has caused extreme frustration & bother, particularly by its technological dumbness. The Polaris System (?Server) seems to recognise saved files in a different order from which they were created. Obsolete versions of documents are perpetually being saved whilst preferred versions tragically are erased. (Is this a part of all 'Cloud' Software Systems?)

            "Tempo doesn't work correctly. It's acknowledged as a 'preference' in the help section. It's not a preference. It's math. Edit: 10/30/2020. I've given you an actual proof for why your app is dysfunction and inaccurate. Still no response. As a reminder, 1/1 @ 400bpm != 8/8 @ 400bpm. This decision saved your developers a lot of memory, but it made the app dysfunctional. 👎",
            "The app is great and recent firmware works great with the watch. But unless I turn on GPS it won't send notifications. Clearly not a connection issue since the metronome works perfectly with GPS turned off... If you want to collect all the data just require google account but don't burn my phone battery for notifications access",

Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",

It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",

The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "I enjoy the ability to listen to a book as I drive, the only to toddler-free time I have. I love the book exchange, so I can keep the books I truly love. It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

            "I've tried many OCR apps (image to text converter) and none of them came close to what this app produces. Although it is still not perfect yet (which is mainly because of infinite handwriting styles), at least it doesn't produce gibberish like the other apps. I hope the algorithm keeps improving and it would be great if you could add speech for other language texts too.",
            "Have been looking for an app to transcribe my handwritten notes to editable text for a while. Just downloaded this app after reading a positive review. The said OCR is by no means perfect, but then neither is my handwriting and so far I am actually pretty impressed. I like to save an image of the page to OneNote and then copy the transcribed text next to it. Would be great if I could setup a macro to do both in one go.",
            "On my galaxy s9 I am using this app in tandem with quizlet (split screen view) to create a study guide. I'm surprised I couldn't find this option on google keyboard, but this is a fine alternative. Ads are annoying but never that bad, and the very empirical way the text is transcribed is much appreciated. 5 stars for functionality, overall 4.7 because ads",
            "Top of the line, excellent for small receipts and business cards. Good for books but you might need two or three takes per page. I couldn't test it properly for handwriting during the very limited trial time allowed. Overall the development of this APP is marvelous, excellent work!",
            "This app has been a very useful tool. I'm so grateful for the intelligence put into making it. God bless you guys. Edit. Now you can't use this app without subscription. It gives you a trial period, after which, you have to subscribe to use it. It's been good while it lasted. Goodbye, I'm uninstalling now."

The application seems to support this: \"Set the maximum number of words you want to be quizzed on in one drill session. If you would like to be quizzed on all words, leave the default setting all\". But there's actually no way to select that \"all\" and the max limit is set to 100 words. Thanks.",

I have downloaded it for German, but it is also helpful for other languages like - French, Spanish etc. The app layout is awesome and easy to use. There is also a pronunciation tool which will tell you the pronunciation of any word in English as well as in the language the word belongs to. It will also show you conjugations, different forms of the word and phrases related to it. You can also take free online language courses.",

            "App is decent for online meetings. I use it for group meetings as well as one on one collaboration. It is as good as zoom and some of the other platforms out there. I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."
