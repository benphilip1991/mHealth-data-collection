Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease caused by the long-standing diabetes.\r\n\r\nBasically, DR affects blood vessels in the light-sensitive tissue (i.e retina).

Unfortunately, in practice the current DR detection solution is nearly infeasible to meet this requirement.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the current solution requires a well-trained clinician and ophthalmologist to manually evaluate digital colour fundus photographs of retina, and DR is identified by locating the lesions associated with vascular abnormalities due to diabetes.\r\n\r\nThough this current solution is effective, it is time-consuming and highly relies on the expertise of well-trained practitioners.

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

            "Simple, easy to use and very useful app. However there is a mix up with the colour dots (orange and green) on the graphs for pre and post meal). On some graphs orange is for pre and green for post-meal, and on others it's the reverse. Please correct this and app gets 5 stars.",

We have protocols for Acupressure, Acupuncture, Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Bach Flower Remedy, Color Therapy, Diet and Nutrition, Exercise, Herbal Therapy, Juice Therapy, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Shiatsu, Sound Therapy, Tai Chi, TCM, Vitamin Therapy, Yoga, Sujok, Auricular Therapy, Hydrotherapy, Rife Therapy, Visualization, Reiki, Magnet Therapy. These protocols when used under proper guidance gives more better feeling and as all the protocols are complementary / alternative therapy it comes with no side effects on application. For one problem – Diabetes, this app provides you many different methods of alternative remedies to manage your blood sugar level and that to absolutely FREE!!! \r\n\r\nDiabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well or insulin resistance. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.\r\n Learn about Diabetes symptoms, causes and treatment  from this App. What diet sugar patient should follow? Maintaining, controlling blood sugar levels is part of managing diabetes. Doctors often prescribe traditional treatments, like insulin injections to keep blood sugar levels normal. Some people with diabetes also use complementary and alternative therapies (CAM). These therapies aim to treat the body and the mind.\r\n This App gives information on Diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, gestational diabetes, diabetes related weight, hypertension / blood pressure, treatment and guidelines.\r\nIf you are interested in using a complementary therapy for treating your diabetes, it’s best that you base your decision on correct information, including the therapy’s potential risks, as well as its benefits. It is also recommended you get an informed, objective opinion from your health professional. \r\n\r\nThere are various modalities of alternative therapies which have indeed proven to be successful for many – but not all – people. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage your diabetes is increasingly common; traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in managing diabetes with alternative techniques.\r\nThere are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being. Many find themselves turning to complementary or \"alternative\" treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments. \r\n \r\nThis app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over your blood sugar levels and manage better health.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care.",

Search:\r\n\r\nIncreased thirst\r\nfrequent urination\r\nIncrease hunger\r\nWeight loss unintentionally\r\nfatigue\r\nFoggy vision\r\nSlow healing of sores\r\nFrequent infections\r\nAreas of dark skin, usually in the armpits and neck.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a doctor\r\n\r\nConsult your doctor if you notice type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nthe reasons\r\n\r\nType 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes insulin-resistant or when the pancreas can not produce enough insulin. The exact cause of this is unknown, although genetic and environmental factors, such as weight gain and inactivity, seem to be contributing factors.\r\nHow Insulin works\r\n\r\nInsulin is a hormone that comes from the gland located behind and under the stomach (pancreas).\r\n\r\nThe pancreas secrete insulin in the bloodstream.\r\nInsulin circulates and allows sugar to enter the cells.\r\nInsulin reduces the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.\r\nWith low blood sugar, the secretion of insulin from the pancreas is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe role of glucose.\r\n\r\nGlucose, sugar, is a major source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and other tissues.\r\n\r\nGlucose comes from two main sources: food and liver.\r\nSugar is absorbed into the blood stream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\r\nThe liver stores and produces glucose.\r\nWhen glucose levels are low, such as not eaten for a long time, the glycogen-stored liver breaks down in glucose to maintain a normal glucose level.\r\n\r\nIn type 2 diabetes, this process does not work well. Instead of moving to cells, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream. As blood sugar levels rise, insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells deteriorate and can not produce enough insulin to meet the body's requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the first type of diabetes, which is less common, the immune system mistakenly destroys beta cells, leaves the body without insulin or does not contain any type of insulin.\r\nRisk factors\r\n\r\nFactors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include:\r\n\r\nthe weight. Weight gain is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, you do not have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes.\r\nFat distribution. If you store fat mainly in the abdomen, you have a risk of type 2 diabetes compared to storing fat elsewhere, such as hips and thighs. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if you are a man with a circumference of more than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) or a woman with a waist greater than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters).\r\nIdle. The lower your activity, the higher your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.\r\nFamily history The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your father or brother has type 2 diabetes.\r\nProfession. Although it is not clear why, people of certain races, including blacks, Latins, American Indians and Asian Americans, are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites.\r\nYears. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after the age of 45. This may be because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they get older. However, type 2 diabetes is increasing significantly among children, adolescents and young people.\r\nIntroduction to diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be labeled as diabetes. If left untreated,",

            "I've been a grindr unlim. user from the time it rolled out but it seems the longer the lifespan of grindr, the worse it gets. I mean, I got so fed up with it Im no longer unlmtd. But wait the amount of ads is beyond necessary and shows they've lost sight of their initial mission. To b forced to watch ads after every profile view, block, or whatever is pathetic. The spamming, the bots, the not sending/connecting. scruff doesn't have these problems, why does Grindr. Its disappointing",
            "I really would like to leave a positive review. Unfortunately for years the messages which are sent, stay just as sent in inboxes all over the world. Just Google it and many people experience the same. This is a basic functionality of a chat/dating app and even that is not working properly. It is okay as free version, but having paid several times now, I expect more than what I get.",
            "I get 50 new messages a day. From people who know I'm not interested. Blocking them is pointless because they make alts. When I do try to block, I have to sit through an ad every single time. Half the time the X doesn't work. I can't find what I'm looking for unless I pay. There is no way to make myself hidden from certain people. Or to automatically keep nudes at bay. So I am subject to daily sexual harassment while trying to make meaningful connections.",
            "It's ad driven yes . Chats are free that's a huge plus in today's \" pay to view \" market . Ads can be a pain , but it's a nessasary pain when you think of the alternative. Should have twice the amount of photos on your profile available. And some tweaking and expanding of the profile description. Blocking taps should be free as many are spam. All in all Grindr gets me far more dates , friends than any other . 👍",
            "This app used to be good - years ago, it's gotten worse with every update as more free features are moved to subscription only. Taps all dated '1 Jan.' Pay walls everywhere. Intrusive ads everywhere. Bots everywhere and yes, they're reported (as you'll suggest in your reply) but they just reappear. Political correctness gone crazy: removing ethnicity filters. It's called sexual preferences you snowflakes. This is why your app rating has dropped to 3.0/5.0. Subscriptions are extortionate."

        "recentChanges": "Hiya! In this update we improve the call blocking experience for users on Android 10 (“Android Q”) and higher: incoming calls that you wish to block will now be blocked completely, and not forwarded to voicemail! You can enable this behavior by setting Hiya as your default caller ID app. Please let us know of any feedback regarding this change. We also squashed some bugs and ensured things are running smoothly overall.",

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

Shifting your screen to night mode can relieve your eyes strain, and your eyes will feel at ease during night reading. Also blue light filter will protect your eyes and help you sleep easily.\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Reduce blue light\r\n- Adjustable filter intensity\r\n- Save power\r\n- Very easy to use\r\n- Built-in screen dimmer\r\n- Eye protector from screen light\r\n- Make sure you are in a comfortable position\r\n- Make sure that there is no glare on the phone's screen.\r\n- Place your phone approximately 40 cm/16 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Close one eye at a time\r\n\r\nTake care of your vision. With this program you can test your vision at home. It can't replace optician's regular full examination or advise of ophthalmologist, but with this vision test you may discover that your eyesight deteriorates and you need to visit a doctor.\r\n\r\nDuring the test you will see different objects. Try to identify shown object. The sequence of objects is random. That prevents learning the sequence and guessing the answer.\r\nHere are some helpful tips to help you avoid vision loss from these age-related eye diseases and other problems:\r\n\r\n1. Find out if you are at higher risk for eye diseases.\r\nBe aware of your family's health history. Do you or any of your family suffer from diabetes or have a history of high blood pressure? Are you over age 60? Any of these traits increase your risk for sight-threatening eye diseases.\r\n\r\n2. Have regular physical exams to check for diabetes and high blood pressure.\r\nIf left untreated, these diseases can cause eye problems. In particular, diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to vision loss from diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and eye strokes.\r\n\r\n3. Look for warning signs of changes in your vision.\r\nIf you start noticing changes in your vision, see your eye doctor immediately. Some trouble signs to look for are double vision, hazy vision and difficulty seeing in low light conditions.\r\n\r\nOther signs and symptoms of potentially serious eye problems that warrant immediate attention include red eyes, frequent flashes of light, floaters, and eye pain and swelling.\r\n\r\n4.

The augmented reality overlay of visual impairments is a good concept but is poorly done in this app. Some warped cheap glasses from Walgreens could approximate the app overlay just as easily. The visual impairments overlay doesn't account for glare, low contrast, diminished peripheral field of view from old age or retinitis pigmentosa, or the general static in the gray scotomas. Many of these things occur simultaneously in a visually impaired person's field of view. The app shows only three visual impairments in a misleadingly simple manner in contrast.

            "I straight up didn't install this app. I've never used it or opened it either but it was taking up lots of my battery (about 1% which is a lot for an app that I have literally never opened). I'm assuming my provider (Verizon, surprise, surprise) downloaded this app automatically during an update to my phone which is fantastic, since I was never alerted of this (read: sarcasm).",
            "Complete Battery Hog. I have to disable the web protection settings or it chews up my battery life in a matter of hours. According to my battery usage stats, Verizon's \"anti-virus scanner\" uses up more battery than Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Mobile Games. On some days, Combined. Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "I have been a subscriber with VERIZON for about 14 yrs. I have been more than satisfied with the cell svc, their products they sell, the support teams, and most of all the protection products they offer. This particular app is of the highest quality out on the market. Can't go wrong with this one!!!",
            "This is trouble some to me I have a 1 in the app window all of the time I do not know what to do of the 1 in the app window need help clearing the 1 in the app window . Cause of this happening to people much in proving is needed to correct the problems with this app here????? Unknown if app window problem location/link & intternet problem double check from your end.",
            "Since the app was installed i cannot access my printer to print emails from my phone. This app sucks. I originally thought it was my printer now I am finding out it is my phone. I have been a Verizon customer for years. I am considering a switch to another company."

Google for \"multibit\" and for the sentence \"“The superior quality of the tests enables the app usage to replace many patient visits, liberate hospital resources, ...”. Multibit is like mVT, but developed by Swedish researchers. mVT should be available to patients w/o prescription and give feedback directly to them!",
            "Instead of helping people they decided to make this test prescription only. For no reason at all, just to make it unavailable for the majority of people living on this planet in many countries, having macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. I wish many people give further negative reviews until they change their policy, to the benefit of sick people and to the benefit of themselves earning money.",

            "I think this game is awsome, I suck at it but it's really fun I beat every level and I was just getting stars from levels that I already beat. It's super funny I love that one level with the spike ball thing that shoots in the air I always try to get hit by it. The only one thing that would make it better is a button that makes you go back. Like if a car goes in reverse there was countless times that I died because I couldn't go back. But readers this game is amazing.",
            "It's so hard to control... when you press GO boutton for a long time, it slows down... The levels are SO hard. I tried like 56 times trying to beat a level and i did not earn anything because it took a long time. Theres a time limit and for the guys who made the game think we acan finish 1 level in 37 seconds, thats when you get just 1 star. And like, the moterbikes thaat are like REALLY REALLY good ( the only ones i like ) cost like 45 stars!",
            "man i love this game, mainly it's physics and the autonomy i have as a player is all i look for and those new ad famous games don't have and frustrates me. The only things that could change should be to improve loop perception and a better looking layout, it has kinda ugly and confusing menus. Love it, hope for improvements.",
            "One of my favorite games in the world is the Trials games. This game is just like it on a smaller scale. Nicely done tracks,some could be longer but its a phone game so great job. This game is closer to Trials then that one Trials game they got on phone.",
            "Awesome lots of bikes to choose from and very easy to control........for the people on here that like the game try Google pass it will allow you access to all the bikes at no charge and also many other games as well..... good luck"

            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. 🙄",

            "I love and highly recommend this game, its the best. Ive been playing for years on many phones, and \"finished\" the game quite a while ago. I have earned every character, world, and upgrade possible, I still like to play but there's nothing left to play for. The global chalenges are ok but I have no more use for coins and gems. You should consider a major update or Temple Run 3. Btw, never had to pay to play.",
            "Nice game.. But most of the maps are locked and we need to purchase them with gems. I had previously installed this game and played the Lost Jungle map which was free then but now its locked now. The same maybe will happen again. It's Halloween season now and they have 3 new maps, but after this is over, it will not be available. This is a great disappointment. Also, sometimes it freezes and the loading icon when we start the game doesn't appear for little long time..",
            "Very good game. I am playing this game for months and this game is my favourate game. It is one of the best offline games. It has many places (maps) like sky summit,frozen shadows,lost jungle etc. due to I like it more than temple run,spirit run and temple run oz. My favourite maps are lost jungle and frozen shadows. This game is the best. It also gives the option for playing in Blazing sands for around 8 minutes. I am waiting for the next update. This game has the best controls. Thank you.",
            "This may seem silly to some but this game has helped greatly in one thing I fear a lot – heights. Sky Summit was one map which I used to dislike a lot coz of the open area around it. But I somehow used to force myself to play it. And m glad i did! I love the map and almost have gotten rid of my heights problems. It might be possible to rid it fully, but it has helped as i dont tense up everytime i run through the skeleton road (spooky summit) of the game. Love it a lot! Thanks! Keep it up!!❤❤",
            "Cool Game. But when I first got my new tablet, and when I sign in to my account from my old tablet, and when I tried to get all of my coins and gems and my profile from my old tablet back, it will not let me have them back. Then it kept on glitching and lagging. So how about you get your butt fixing this game, this instantly, immediately right now! 😤😡😠😠😠"

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",

I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. 🙄",

            "I have to say that the moto g9 has some serious camera issues and u guys have to resolve it soon. The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",
            "Just bought the Moto g 5G plus however the app crashes every time when I zoom out the rear camera with ultra-wide and it asks me to restart the camera......is it the problem with the app or the new phone which just opened today",
            "What's the use of hardware if your are not having a perfect optimised software ? Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos. All previous generation moto camera where doing a great job than this why this you have done for motorola fusion plus please rectify asap..."

            "I love and highly recommend this game, its the best. Ive been playing for years on many phones, and \"finished\" the game quite a while ago. I have earned every character, world, and upgrade possible, I still like to play but there's nothing left to play for. The global chalenges are ok but I have no more use for coins and gems. You should consider a major update or Temple Run 3. Btw, never had to pay to play.",
            "Nice game.. But most of the maps are locked and we need to purchase them with gems. I had previously installed this game and played the Lost Jungle map which was free then but now its locked now. The same maybe will happen again. It's Halloween season now and they have 3 new maps, but after this is over, it will not be available. This is a great disappointment. Also, sometimes it freezes and the loading icon when we start the game doesn't appear for little long time..",
            "Very good game. I am playing this game for months and this game is my favourate game. It is one of the best offline games. It has many places (maps) like sky summit,frozen shadows,lost jungle etc. due to I like it more than temple run,spirit run and temple run oz. My favourite maps are lost jungle and frozen shadows. This game is the best. It also gives the option for playing in Blazing sands for around 8 minutes. I am waiting for the next update. This game has the best controls. Thank you.",
            "This may seem silly to some but this game has helped greatly in one thing I fear a lot – heights. Sky Summit was one map which I used to dislike a lot coz of the open area around it. But I somehow used to force myself to play it. And m glad i did! I love the map and almost have gotten rid of my heights problems. It might be possible to rid it fully, but it has helped as i dont tense up everytime i run through the skeleton road (spooky summit) of the game. Love it a lot! Thanks! Keep it up!!❤❤",
            "Cool Game. But when I first got my new tablet, and when I sign in to my account from my old tablet, and when I tried to get all of my coins and gems and my profile from my old tablet back, it will not let me have them back. Then it kept on glitching and lagging. So how about you get your butt fixing this game, this instantly, immediately right now! 😤😡😠😠😠"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "I did an update last night causing me to lose lives I had stored up, gold bars and even though I beat level 734 over 6 times it will not let me move past. On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",
            "I've been playing ALL the Bubble Witches for years now and I COMPLETELY fell in love with all of them! 🥰 I have a panic disorder and these games help so much to soothe my anxieties and let me focus on the fun! I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "Great game, great graphic, great sound, it's good to keep your mind off things if your stress out. it also keep you relax doesn't cut out in the middle of the game. I'm less on the internet by playing this game because it's keeps my mind occupied. I reckon this is one of the second bubble games one play store app. That I would recommend to anyone that enjoy colours. some of the levels gets hard but part of the game I guess it's most enjoyable game.",
            "Fun game. Not so ridiculously hard that you feel as though you can't win without boosters, but also still challenging. Not a fan of the music, like, at all. It sounds like elevator music or the kind that you would hear while on hold on the telephone. Though, it doesn't take away from how fun this game is. The colours are awesome and the backgrounds are lovely. I also appreciate all the opportunities to earn boosters.",
            "Love this game but when you go to next level you only get half of advertizment and can't get out of game or finish the game. please fix.The game still has the same problem where i have to shut down my computer to get out of game. It is getting very frustrating. If not fixed soon i will play elsewhere.There is no back button or close button. only forsed to install a new game or shut down computer.",
            "Great in the beginning but later on if gives you NO chance to earn extra boosters which makes it almost impossible to complete. Further there all the levels looks and feels the same. One of the worst bubble games. I have deleted the app.",
            "Great game overall , but not really enjoying the new Square popping up trying to force me to agree to terms and agreements. I'm not going to agree to anything your game either needs to be readily available or start charging to play it, but I don't need to be scammed into anything just to play a mobile app and if it keeps popping up I will be uninstalling. 🤷‍♂️ Just Sayin..."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

There's no way to lessen or in any way control the difficulty level. It would be nice if there were a way to choose your difficulty level that you wanted to play each day. This set up, though just has you on one track that gets harder by the level.",

I'm in the 100s level and these balls with the ? are annoying and unhelpful and makes it harder to get three stars since the last ball on that level keeps changing colors. The balls with the \"-\" are annoying. On the first level with it it's impossible not to pop especially with blaster. Also the previous issues have not been fixed.",

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "Its very interesting game. Also, such helpful team out there. I face some issues while playing this game and i emailed for online support. They not only solve its problem but kept follow up until i got satisfied. Its great",
            "I have always loved bubble shooter games, This time around, I'm starting all over and I still enjoy this type of game immensely!",
            "Made it to level 142, time to uninstall cant get past the level. These games are suppose to be relaxing not so stressful you want to throw your phone across the room.",
            "Can't even get to second level before been bombarded with ads, and ads at bottom of screen. Yes I know ads bring revenue, but there is a balance, between people enjoying the game few ads and get some revenue, or bombarding people with ads and uninstall (like me) and get no revenue. Goodbye."

            "It's great at first but it start to get really irritating when you can't do anything without paying or watching ads. The ads are incredibly long. When you end up watching them to get the extra shots, it still makes it impossible to move past. And tbh it backfires because eventually after a few attempts over days, you get fed up of the whole game and find something new to play. Not happy with it",
            "Some users are complaining about the bubbles, and how the useful colours don't show up until it's far too late to win. I've been playing this game for a very long time, and I can say with 100% certainty that this was not the case until the last few updates. Clearly the game is becoming more about the ad revenue. The events and races are also just messed up (some days they're there, and suddenly you open the game and it's no longer there). Point is, I'm too annoyed to continue with this nonsense.",
            "The app is not working properly . It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly. It is coming that bubble shooter is not working properly then there come 3 options:- 1. Send feedback 2. Open app again 3. Close app . But now the problem is solved and I have completed almost 1600 levels. It's an excellent game to play . Please download this game",
            "Bubble Shooter is grt fun when yr bored & it is casual and reminds u of arcade machines back in the day. It does have annoying adds and it can hoax u when you watch a video for Bonus Shots. But overwise it is amaze! Good times playing it, but even if u played every day for a year you still wouldn't finish Level Mode, cuz it has litterally over 2000 levels! I'm not kidding, play it & see. The graphics are grt and they have decent contorls. Overall its a grt game, which is grt fun.",
            "This could be a great game. I am a very good player and in the first 20 levels (the easy ones) more than a 3rd of all bubbles could not be used becuz the color was blocked or so far up unreachable. And worse yet it gives you the same non useable color over n over n over again in row til you get to the last 10 shots then gives u a useable color too late to have any chance of winning. This is not a hard game at all. Is just rediculously unplayable."

            "Filters don't work at all when you set them (ex height, distance, etc.) After a few swipes, you're not allowed to swipe for the day. This app is annoying and needs to be updated as it has a lot of potential! I don't even know how many right swipes I get! I am told that there are no matches but then when I close the app, and open it in half an hour, then I have more matches. There are so many limitations to the app. I never get notifications on my Android phone even though the settings are fine",
            "I think bumble is terrific. It's best feature is the profiles, which have long been great at encouraging users to build something that says a bit more about them. The quick facts allow a good cross-section of a person, while the questions encourage them to open up without authoring a long profile. The 24 hour limit also applies just enough pressure to give those early conversations momentum, while letting go of connections that weren't quite there, to encourage people to find something stronger.",
            "My dating experience on here is very satisfying, I like how the app works. However, I have issues with receiving notifications, even when turning off battery saver or putting high priority from my phone settings. And also, please PLEASE don't send a notification to all my matches when my snooze is over, or at least let me choose whether I want to send the notification or not. It's very embarrassing for me.",
            "80% of my matches never send that first message and when you do get one and reply, its like they deleted the app altogether. Basically any match will most likely waste your time and thoughts. The app would make more sense if it was called \"dream crusher\" or \"crush crusher\". And the truth is girls are even worse at messaging first so youre system right now just doesnt work!! And not worth a penny.",
            "Account blocked for no reason given!!...avoid this app at all costs. I've had zero success on this app since April 2020 in comparison to others. I refuse to pay for any dating service long term and I've used the premium once. I went to check this morning and my account is blocked. There are no options to appeal nor are there any options to contact for the reason in doing so. Does the 'freedom of information act' not permit you to share with me the reasons for this action to be taken?"

            "This app does not work. I called AT&T three times and it still not working. Keep getting the same error message \" The system is currenrly unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" The funny part it used to work fine but I noticed in September I was getting a lot of spam calls so I checked the app. If I could I would give it negative stars. Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",
            "I have the new Samsung note ultra, and this app doesn't open. I always get an error message. \"Somethings not right\", \"Not avaliable at this time\", \"try again later\". This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",
            "This app doesn't work. When I run it I get the error message, \"Something went wrong. The system is unavailable. Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",
            "I really liked the app, until it stopped working. I get messages of Need more mobile data...if it takes more than 9 Gigs, I don't want it. I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

I'm not sure how this app got any five-star reviews not going to lie. if anyone is able to use this app and it's helpful to them in any way, I would love to know your secret.",
            "This app is sooo buggy and nothing has changed for the 3 years I've been a customer! Can't update any profile information ever, it's so annoying. One way or another something is going to glitch out and you won't be able to finish your task or it won't recognize it or won't load the page or whatever. Wish I could just delete it off my phone...",
            "I am satisfied with my service there are no hidden fees or added charges each month. My bill is consistent and that is what I wanted, other networks raised my monthly bill without communicating with me and it caused a financial hardship for me. The T- mobile app is user friendly and easy to navigate. I am very happy with my T-Mobile network service and I would recommend T-Mobile to my friends and family over any other network out on the market today.",
            "I love the T-Mobile app. When I put my new SIM card in my phone, it was not activated yet and I could not make phone calls, but I was able to use the T-Mobile app to live chat with a representative who activated my SIM card for me. Thanks T-mobile! There are also many other things that you can do using the app including lots of information about your account.",
            "Any other app would get 3-4 stars, but T-Mpbil4 has excellent standards and Ledger exclusive customer experiences across almost the entire board except with this app. In one word, this app is CLUNKY. Processes move slow, 2-step verification can close the app out, any smoothness you have is totally lost w/ pop up or split screen and navigation feels like traversing the wreckage of a 4-app collision. Note 10+ 5G this is not hardware issue. 1 star only to bring it to yalls attentjon"

            "Absolutely no issues to report. MotoZ4, running Android 10. It's a basic app but, that's exactly what you want in cloud storage. Simple and to the point. Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

            "Was working great but I didn't realize it was blocking phone calls from doctor's office, and similar places. No option to program it not to block those numbers so I have to turn the blocking off. Also everything prompts you to go premium...I thought the last uncarrier move said this would be free? Now it just feels like a additional ploy to get money out of us...sneaky.",
            "It's been a long time coming for this app and finally its here Thank you T-mobile I no longer have to go through phone call after phone call. I would get more phone calls from scammers more than my own personal calls on a daily I never wanted to answer my phone cause I just knew it was probably a scam of some sort I can't explain how annoying that is. So thank you so very much T-mobile....",
            "**Response to developer: Scam block is already turned on, it just doesn't work very well. Make the app better instead of blaming your customers please.** Doesn't block very many calls, but has blocked calls from contacts. That can be fixed by adding them to favorites, but it's still annoying. I liked it better when the TMobile system would say \"scam likely\" which seems to have been discontinued after this app launched. It sounds good but doesn't work very well.",
            "Useless, reroutes spam callers to voicemail. Basic app notifications are locked behind paywall. Just download Google Phone cause unlike this it's free, it works, and you can mark callers as spam from the phone app immediately, unlike this where you wait hours . App has a problem where voicemail calls and unknown numbers call don't appear, so you cannot mark them as spam. The entirety of this should be free for all T-Mobile customers. Better yet opensoure it, so people can fix it.",
            "At first this worked great. I wasn't getting any calls that ever said scam likely. Until the last few weeks I have been receiving four or five calls a day from a number that has the same area code and prefix as my number. I block the number, just to get another call from the same area code and prefix. Of course I don't answer. I block, they change the last four digits in their number and call again within 10 minutes."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",

            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

While it technically blocks the number, it still allows the person to leave a voicemail. Which is not really blocking at all, is it? They need to fix this glitch.",

And it's not listing the Spam or Fraud calls or whose the caller. Get it together or I will not renew next month! I'm paying for this service, do better or refund me my money seriously!! 🤦‍♀️😠😡 😤",

If no one complains about these newer numbers, Mr Number, cannot know who they are. Let Mr Number who is calling. If they did not leave a voice mail, block the number is my advice.",

And please brings some space ship that can be buy with germs which are used to combine two spaceship in order to make new improved spaceship. I have played it and love it but most of the time events are based only on shopping like buying ship in discount or something other. You don't need to bring any events like this. Also all those things can be bring within shopping section. So please thinks about it once. Thank you.",
            "Good fun game at some point. BUT...... microtrasaction are out of this world. 50 bucks for a 30 days subscription and so on. if you want to be competitive and don't mind spending hundreds of dollars, you can play this. Ps. you can get some stuff for free, but you are going to spend hours watching ads. Example to get a free ship you have to watch over 40 mins of ads to unlock it.",
            "NOTE: All 5 star reviews are paid for as company gives prizes, lame ones, for good reviews. Detailed reviews with real info you should believe. On behalf of Subs, and many others, stop giving false promises of rewards. Only play this game if you want to be lied to and support a company with no ethics. Join me in not being paid to give a 5 star review to a company and tell how you've been taken advantage of and your time wasted.",
            "Ive played quite a bit since the plague started. I had 7 or eight ships that were upgraded in the different stats. I also had several side guns also upgraded. After the latest update several of my ships and side guns can no longer be selected. Inworked really hard to get the money and gems and what not for those ships and upgrades. What happened to take them away? I would give 5 stars because i love the game that much. But taking all my ships? My wakanda ship? Wth? Edit: Fixed within a day!!",
            "I absolutely love this game, I play it 24/7, But I'm confused as to Why all of a sudden it's not allowing me to play due to a pop up saying, TimeOut!!!!, May someone please tell me what is wrong, I brought in over 30 friends to download this game an they don't see it but me..They are all wanting to delete it like myself may I please have an explanation as to why it's saying this ONLY on the partners section only🤔🤔🤔🤔"

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Yes I enjoy the relaxing game but unfortunately it is interrupted nearly every single advertisement by a still picture advertising a theatrical booking to the point that it is impossible to get rid of, ,the only way is to completely turn off my device and reboot it,,, I'm going to have to delete the game and download something else, ,it's not relaxing anymore, , it's become a chore, ,thank you",
            "So far, I love this. Easy to play,relaxing, short ads! Graphics are sharp, great levels, progressively more difficult. Especially love the little helper dragon who blasts you out of tough blockades, in fact, his little magic wand slowly refills and allows you to blast through rocks over again. This is so much more satisfying, some games arm you with the wrong color bubbles, forcing you to buy bombs. No thank you! So far this is #1 for me great job to this app maker, thank you!",
            "Would've given 5 stars but certain ads (yatze) do not let you exit the ad and continue game play. Have to exit the game and reload. Very annoying. Also, there are some disturbing ads containing sexual content. I have requested these ads be removed numerous times but they keep showing up. I will probably uninstall this app because of this even though I really enjoy playing.",
            "What a great way to pass the time It's a good game for the whole family, easy enough for the younger or inexperienced. And yet it's challenging enough for the more experienced 'gamers'. But most importantly is the fact that my family really enjoy this game which, of course, makes for a more enjoyable game night. We're looking forward to other apps by this same company.",
            "You all have way to many advertisement s and then try and force a person to spend money. Not all people that play these games gamble. This game is the first that I have seen this many advertisements. Turns a person off to something they may have really tried if it hadn't been pushed on them. I'm going to uninstall because you have turned me off to a lot of things. Thank you. Happy sailing."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Yes I enjoy the relaxing game but unfortunately it is interrupted nearly every single advertisement by a still picture advertising a theatrical booking to the point that it is impossible to get rid of, ,the only way is to completely turn off my device and reboot it,,, I'm going to have to delete the game and download something else, ,it's not relaxing anymore, , it's become a chore, ,thank you",
            "So far, I love this. Easy to play,relaxing, short ads! Graphics are sharp, great levels, progressively more difficult. Especially love the little helper dragon who blasts you out of tough blockades, in fact, his little magic wand slowly refills and allows you to blast through rocks over again. This is so much more satisfying, some games arm you with the wrong color bubbles, forcing you to buy bombs. No thank you! So far this is #1 for me great job to this app maker, thank you!",
            "Would've given 5 stars but certain ads (yatze) do not let you exit the ad and continue game play. Have to exit the game and reload. Very annoying. Also, there are some disturbing ads containing sexual content. I have requested these ads be removed numerous times but they keep showing up. I will probably uninstall this app because of this even though I really enjoy playing.",
            "What a great way to pass the time It's a good game for the whole family, easy enough for the younger or inexperienced. And yet it's challenging enough for the more experienced 'gamers'. But most importantly is the fact that my family really enjoy this game which, of course, makes for a more enjoyable game night. We're looking forward to other apps by this same company.",
            "You all have way to many advertisement s and then try and force a person to spend money. Not all people that play these games gamble. This game is the first that I have seen this many advertisements. Turns a person off to something they may have really tried if it hadn't been pushed on them. I'm going to uninstall because you have turned me off to a lot of things. Thank you. Happy sailing."

My only problem with the app is the fact you can't delete contacts which is quite annoying, I know you can just block and clear them but it isn't that efficient. Please try and fix this as soon as possible. Else this is the best chat app I have ever used. Oh and I recognised a new fault in it, When using the app or web app. It takes time to load on older computers and pcs which takes hours to load due the security.",
            "It's nice that the security is good but if a IM app takes ages to send message even on high speed internet that's saddening, the webclients or even the desktop app takes ages to deliver the message in the group, that need to be fixed. In mobile app to the caching of app state is buggy, and hide content on app switch dosent work, all it does is just shows the older app state. there are many more bugs but for the time being it that's the most I want to write. And add a feature to unfriend.",
            "Consistently tells me I don't have internet even though I do. Sends messages out of order, sometimes hours or even days later, if it sends them at all. Not sure what happened, been using it for a while and it used to be fine. Super frustrating when you're trying to carry on a conversation.",
            "After a while, the sound of one of the interlocutors disappears during a voice conversation if you turn off the screen or switch to another application. But the sound returns if you switch back to Wire.",
            "For some reason one of my chat groups that does show up on my desktop does not show up on the phone app, I've attempted many times to solve this problem and still have not figured out why it's missing. Otherwise the app is fine, but I do feel it lacks some of the features that you get from keybase and that app was free. Unfortunately the PRC owns KB now so I can't trust it."

Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad.

            "Luv Galaga This game is awesome. I've had to figure it out all on my own. Still so many unanswered questions as to how to play the game and what everything means. And yes I've looked. I've done this fine that too. I'm thinking the game will get boring soon but ... When I played Galaga I could turn the machine over, I was a winner lol ... This one just seems too repetitive at every level. All reviews were helpful.",
            "Pay to win platform. Glitchy, and rewards not updated to recognize VIP levels. Unrealistic difficulty levels as one progresses through game. Over priced, and too many cheaters on platform. Update: cheaters are even worse, and now you can't report them. The last update made the ships weaker so you'll have to spend more money to even have a chance in campaign or pvp. The game is trash, and the developers suck.",
            "Great game. Only game that I play on my phone. But this latest update has made the game worse. In PVP i get paired to play an opponent that has lower level than me, by the time that I finish wave 1, the opponent is on wave 3. The bots are more difficult to kill for me, but the opponent still gets through waves fast. And i see he has weaker ships 🤷🏻‍♂️",
            "I have insalled 3 updates the last 3 weeks. Will not auto update even thought I have it set to do so. Two weeks in a row that it is \"Boss Friday\" and it only shows up once in a while. Missed last mini-game for unknown reasons, it just was not there. Constant issues and never get answers when I contact devs. The game is grest when it works right but that serms to be less and less causing me to lose interest.",
            "Awesome game. Killer graphics! The levels just keep getting better! Download it now! Note: Not a compensated endorsement! I'm a real person & not a not nor anything like , I don't know the devs. I'm telling you this as my own opinion."

For some reason when I feel that I have learn a stage well enough in the 2nd lap everything goes crazy, it's like another stage. Also from one bike to the next the performance difference is not that rewarding. I found myself many times to be slower from a #2 bike when I have #3.",

            "I just want to say this is an amazing game, as someone who frequently rides a sport bike at excessive speeds in heavy traffic, this is almost exactly what it's like. Great job to the devs you really capture that feeling and put it into a mobile app bravo. To make this game even better I would make the bikes customisable like paint jobs and bike mods. Maybe open a multiplayer race mode, that would be top notch. Great job devs",
            "It could be the best game of its genre but the rewards are lame. Getting cash to buy the right bike can take way too long which put me off. I would spend real money but everything is too expensive. Give me a good deal and im happy to pay but over price everything and i aint spending a penny. Real shame coz the physics, dynamics, graphics, all of that, is top notch.",
            "It was good the few first levels, but after a while, it gets really hard to get new bikes because they are really expensive, and it takes a long time to earn the cash. I literally bout a really nice bike, and after 2-3 missions, it said I needed a new one. I JUST BOUGHT IT! You literally need to grind for two hours to earn the cash for a nice bike that will last you more than 3 missions. the game was good at first. But now the fun is gone.",
            "It's an excellent game. Good graphics and very exciting. What I dislike in the game is the fact that some levels are just too difficult and nearly impossible to get the gold. You don't expect the bike to have a near miss when you line up 4 vehicles horizontally with little or no space to manauvre and also brake the speed immediately to allow movement. It's as if the game is programmed to dent good records at some certain levels. Overall it is good game.",
            "Smooth easy to control with great sense of speed still the best traffic game on mobile, I have been proud to buy with real money to support this game, hope they don't forget this and still keep up the updates, my wish list is small gentle corners maybe working traffic lights on cross junctions hence dodging side flowing traffic and more area's maybe since a Turkish developer add the pine Mountain forest roads two way one lane roads of south Turkey especially on a dawn morning just a thought."

Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game.

If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

They aren't trying to be your pal, they just want your consent to profit even more off of your account.",
            "It does not save my login credentials - I have to re-log in every time I open it, even when I have \"Remember Me\" selected & permissions on. Logging in is a two-step process so this wastes time. This is the connection my computer uses (a jetpack) & it has a data limit so I need to track it, which means I have to put up with this every day (I haven't found the same information on the website). I didn't have this problem with the old phone, which may have had an older version of the app. Annoying.",
            "The app keeps me up to date with my data limit, I can pay my bill, look at my bill, and get my $3.00 Amazon gift card every month with the app. Make sure you take advantage of receiving and using your $3.00 gift card every month to offset your bill. It's a nice litte bonus at the end of the month that actually helps.",
            "Very buggy along with their website. I been trying to fix my billings, plans, add-ons for the longest time and still seem to be getting the run around. App is worthless and keeps logging me off. Broken links or none what so ever. Now I am wondering if I made the right choice. When downgrading plans, make sure to un enroll in any add-on or you won't be able to un enroll afterwards and be charge each month. Check when changing plans that you don't get hidden or added fees."

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+. When i sign it it says \"logging in\" then immediately says \"logging out\" and \"something went wrong please try again later\".. this has been going on for a week. Signing into messenger lite was no problem at all though.  I tried signing out of all sessions, waiting a day, re installed the app multiple times, confirming this was me, signing into without a sim card etc etc.."

ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!! Thanks so much for such an awesome Photo Editing App!! Keep up the AWESOME WORK!!",

            "This app is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for like 2 years now. If you understand all the features (which are so many), you won't ever need any other photo editing app. It has no logos after making a collage or editing, great layouts , different sizes with ratios and options while making collage to crop , swap , delete , anything. You can choose the border or just have no borders. it's just awesome. Thanks for the app makers.",

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",
            "Each update is worse than last one, i have always one fake notification in app that not goes away until i force stop the app,why loadimg messages and chats take so much time?",
            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option. Thank you beforehand for such a great work!"

Then when you go to use gold bars, if then boots you out. There is still the mini game from lock down too on there that if you push the wrong button, freezes the app and you have to come out and restart again. It's not lack of memory as when I tried it on the tablet I have the same issue...",
            "it is addicting and lots of fun to play. Never gets old! It gets more challenging the higher you go in the levels. Im nearly to leel 500 and its still fun. has gotten really strategic now in levels 500 and above. Now at level 720, it has become much more difficult and at times can be not so much fun but I seem to stick with it to keep going to higher levels. I will find myself on the same level for a while and then suddenly get it and that keeps me interested. I am in level 958 now",
            "I love this game. The only thing that makes me mad at it is the fact the the fairies are dumb af. I mean instead of helping they just don't... how many times have I lost a level cause there are 3 bubbles, one of them is going to fall, but the fairy still chooses that one... other than that yes. I love the game.",
            "Love it! Been playing over 2 years, lol... and I'm on level 2,433! It's very addicting. I love playing it when I'm bored and in my breaks at work. I also like how they change things up and the bonus levels! Keep up the good work!",
            "Immediately unplayable for me. Every shot makes the screen briefly flash and shake. No idea why games want to alienate anyone with motion sickness, migraines, seizure risk, etc. No reason why you can't have a nice looking game without the constant movement, flashing, sparkling, shaking the screen."

I really love this I recommend it honestly! The only trouble I had was when I would get on another app it would say \"your device's memory is running out, please refresh all your apps.\" And I've done that and used the \"save memory\" thing on this app or whatever and it still says that. Thank you for the app.",
            "Seems to do what it states its doing which is turning off unused apps to make phone faster and relenquish space for more temporary memory. I would upgrade to the pay subscription like I have with kapersky I have no problem paying for something that works oh, but I do not like the fact that this app automatically takes your money, anually rather than allow ME TO PAY MY OWN BILL WHEN IT IS DUE, LIKE IM AN IDIOT INCAPABLE OF MANAGING A TIMELY BILL. That is and has always been a sign of a shady deal",
            "I love the app it helped me with my lagging and with my battery and storage but the only problem is chrome keeps on saying\"I have three viruses on my phone and it could delete all my data\" but when I open the app it says I have no viruses.is it just chrome being weird or the app??",

            "I like the new layout and look. However, I would give 5 stars if I didn't have to search for what comes through on the alert notifications. Example, \"there's a special loan offer\", where?! I have search for it, when the app should go right to the information that is on alert notification, and not just the home page. Many alerts I just ignore, because I become frustrated trying to find them. Just open directly to them once pressed, otherwise I'm just wasting time seeing the same information.",
            "I really love this app and the website. It's convenient and easy to use. My only complaint right now it that no matter how many times I click on \"Recommendations\" and scroll through it, it ALWAYS says there is 1 waiting. It's been going on for a while and it's on both desktop and mobile, so I know it's not just this latest update to the app. I don't like the advertising of the credit cards all the time but I get it, to keep the app free you need to have ads, no problem. Recommend me stuff all the time, I don't care, just register that I've seen it once I have.",
            "Great app, I mean ausome app, in less than a year, this app has helped me get all three of my credit scores boosted. They were all between 510-530 and now, only a year later all three range from 622-643. So this app has done wonders. After a year of doing what the app said I went from having no credit to having 3 credit cards and owning a house. SO CREDIT KARMA GETS A 10 STAR RATING FROM ME. I USED TO SPEND MONEY AS FAST AS IT HIT MY POCKET NOW I HAVE OVER 10,000 IN SAVINGS AND I'M A PACK RAT.",
            "Good app, but this latest update sucks. I don't like the new UI, and it feels slower now. And one thing that's been bugging me forever, when you open the app and it displays where you enter your pin, raise all the numbers up. It's way too low. But the in app UI sucks now. Change it back please. It was easier on the eyes before and easier to read",
            "I've been monitoring my credit for a couple years now with Credit Karma, but this is thee worst update they've done! Not to mention, your score in the app will never be what a lender pulls. So I just use it to monitor credit card usage and any collections. Other than that, the app is garbage. Edit to include CK's response: I already know that. I am informing others, because clearly your formula isn't accurate. And if it's not accurate... it's not useful."

I give it 10 * all the way around!",
            "Can't find my canon mg5760 which is supposed to be compatible so what's the point of this app? I can print from my pc on the same network, my router finds the printer so it's definitely this app that's broken. Canon you had one job and failed at it.",
            "I recently bought a pixma photo printer, and cannot set it up for the life of me. I work in technology and am extremely competent, but I cannot get my printer to connect. The guide online is not an accurate reflection of the app. When searching for a printer, it searches without giving me any additional options, and always says the printer is not found. It might be a good app, but i can't use it!",
            "I attempted to install the app on my laptop but after fiddling around with it for half an hour I changed tactics and installed the app on my phone. Up and running within 2 minutes",
            "I didnt know how to make it work for some time, but my confusion was not the fault of the app. I attempted to make it wok using a very old archos tablet. Was then amazed at its performance with a very old but stylish sony tablet, then, obliged at last to buy an iPhone, discovered that it works perfectly with this app, without my help at all. Dont know why. But very happy with that."

            "I really liked the game at first. But now, even though I have a really good ball, that I got from a bag, that has 2 levels up in accuracy and time, I keep missing the net. Also when I hit the white line at the bar perfectly. It's easy to tell, that it's because the game wants me, to use real money on a new ball or something like that.. Bad way to make money on your game. I'm truly disappointed 😞",
            "I Love This Game!!! If there's more like a \"Free chat with each other\" that would be perfect!\"# 😱 Hope you're reading this review cause I'm saying with my heart! 😀 By the way I just met a hacker in the game!! Even if he didn't hit board he will get perfect score! I Think this shouldn't be allowed in the game Mini clips I think you should to take care of that! I even have his ID if you want then I can send you his Id So please Give him some warning! Lastly want to get your reply of my review√",
            "Decent game but I've lost a ton of cash because of losing connection to the game servers when there has been nothing wrong with my internet connection. You actually lose your fee instead of just being sent back to the home screen, but harsh considering the user isn't to blame or didn't quit. Maybe a ploy to get people to pay for cash.",
            "Too many \"A\" bugs!!!! Kicks you off when you are in game play!!! Especially when you are winning. Then all of a sudden \"connection error\" cannot connect to Facebook Issue all the time. But only when you are racking in money."

            "It's a very good app, but the photo editing options are less. It would be very helpful if there more editing options especially in the colour option. Also, saving the pdf is taking a lot of time. If the time for saving is reduced it would be very helpful. Other than this, the app is great. I can smoothly share assignments using this app. There are no ads in this app which is great! Overall it's a good app but it could be made better by adding some more editing options.",
            "Good app. But this app tends to lag at times. Please make the generation of PDFs faster because it takes a lot of time and because of it, I could not submit my assessments on time. Though the copies were checked, but I had to listen to warnings from teachers. Please make the generation faster. Otherwise it is a very useful app and is handy too.🙂🙂🙂",
            "Finally we have a phone scanner that works about as well as a flat bed scanner! I've tried a few of these types of apps in the past, and they usually had issues. But this one seems to have hit the bulls eye on everything. The auto-detect borders almost always works, the adjustments are easy, the file size is reasonable, the touch-up/edit features work very well, and it doesn't erase your entire scan if your screen turns off because you had to step away for a second (like DropBox does). No complaints about this app so far!",
            "I'm using this to scan my answers to exam questions, then i make them pdf and send to my instructor. This is the best because I can select different filters for better look and legibility. When I pick a filter, I can shoot photos back to back without stopping and it will turn all of them to my selected filter. Also, it has auto-detection for documents. When I direct my camera to a document, it understands the context i dont even need to shoot or crop, it does everything by itself. Super useful",
            "my main issue with this app is that it cannot pick up each section of a certain document consistently, e.g I'll scan a document and half of it is very light and difficult to identify, while in reality it is just as dark as the other half of the page, though this may also be partially attributed to background lighting. nevertheless, this app simplifies processing and downloading scanned documents and for me, is more effective than a standard camera."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

I can never find a exit sign on an add and it just goes on forever and adds run while you are playing a level, that is messed up. so adds literally destroyed the levels I was playing. I can only play it on airplane mode, but then i cannot get the upgraded canon and other things. so it is annoyingggggg. please fix it..... i gave 1 star because of that. otherwise the game is great. so sorry.",

Although it's free to play, I expect to watch ads, however, there are ads before & after each level, from 2 ads @ 5 seconds each and many 30 seconds. So if you enjoy watching ads more than playing the game, you will enjoy this game. For me, I watch less ads on YouTube than I do with this game. Thanks for a unique game, but no thanks.

            "Ok, I have a cheap phone and this app is not good for it at all. When installed phone actually runs super slow and freezes up so bad that the only way to get it back on is to take the battery out then reboot😳. I've had others check it for me to ensure it wasn't caused by something I did as well! Not only all this but it even affects other apps in performance. Mind you I only install very few app at a time so my memory is not affected. So, I have to say that I would never recommend it.",
            "This app is RIDICULOUS!! I've had nothing but problems since my hubby switched from AT&T to Sprint. I'm unable to type a sentence without a pop-up telling me \"Carrier Hub is not responding. \" I went into app and forced it to stop. I don't know what's going on with Sprint and their company, but it SUCKS!! *10/30/20 - same issues. RIDICULOUS",
            "Just switched phones and got the oneplus8+ and this was already installed on it. I'm with T-Mobile and have been for years and now sprint is just messing it all up. This thing keeps having some MCM client process request notification pop up and training my battery. It's very annoying. After some research this thing is draining my battery and doesn't even do anything for my phone. In less then 2 hours I went from 81% to 48%. I just got the phone this afternoon. Very disappointed.",

I have fake Gmail, Google, Chrome, Bluetooth, operating system changed, my Boost, you name if there's an overly for that. If there's not you get error loading page till there is one. Been locked out of one of my Gmail accounts for 8 months but I can't contact Google because I can't get to the real site. Go look at the developers page and you will not believe what you see.",

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

The app has really suffered in performance since the update. It takes a really long time to restore pics and videos back to the gallery, and at times I can't even find them once they are restored. It's a shame as the app used to work almost instantly and was great. - The fix mentioned below was because the app wouldn't even load, that was fixed.",

The app description claims this camera app is \"really really fast with zero shutter lag\" but that has not been the case for me. I want to be able to take pictures of my family when funny things happen. By the time this thing decides to wake up and take a picture, the moment is gone. I'm on a moto g5 plus.",
            "A couple days ago, while looking for 2 videos, I noticed that they'd moved from their regular places. I then checked to see if the Date stamp changed too and it did not. Second issue: as I reviewed the details on the videos and then a group of photos, I noticed that the Time stamp was wrong on every single one of them. I reviewed the Date & Time setting on the phone itself and it is set correctly yet photos I know were taken in the morning are timestamped hours later. Nothing online to fix it.",
            "Wow! I've never seen an app get this much negative feedback! I took a few minutes and read several comments and it's quite clear this app is broken. The cameras in these Moto E5's do work but you will need to download a working camera app because once again this app is broken!!! It took me only a couple of minutes to figure it out I wonder what's up with the clowns at Motorola! I'm not a cell phone or software expert I'm just a guy who can read and understands what he has read. Fix your app Moto",
            "App gives camera error every time and does not save photos any longer. UPDATE: Found that having a 64GB micro SD card formatted as internal storage was what was causing the problem. Switched to 32GB and now use it as external and app works. (had been working for nearly three years the other way) Must have been an update to the phone when I wasn't looking. Maybe the E4 was just too good for the price they charged and they had to downgrade the phone. Upgrading review to five stars.",
            "Worked fine for many years. New update makes the app unstable. Frequently crashes on start. Randomly crashes during use. I suppose this is modern software for ya. Fix what ain't broke. Changes nobody asked for including UI - consistency out the window. Push things out the door as fast and cheap as possible - quality out the window.

        "comments": [
            "I think the developers are bored with this game. They seem to just be spewing out rehashes of levels and the only updates appear to be efforts to wind back rewards and get as much money as they can out out of players before they cut and run. From a good game to one of the most boring in a few updates. Got a few months free play then zip, uninstall. Don't bother, money grubbers. Not worth it.",
            "I loved this game starting out but now that I'm in the 3000 plus levels I hardly win. The earthworm challenges are almost impossible to beat. Theres some fun little challenges but unless you can beat at least 10 levels you dont get the rewards. Be ready to spend a lot of money to buy gold to be able to beat levels. I've been playing since 2017 but I haven't hardly played in the last couple weeks. Probably gonna be uninstalling it very soon. Feels like more work than fun anymore",
            "This game has become unplayable without buying gold. I'm on level 3650. You can spend hours doing one level which is boring. If they added one move each time you failed a level it wouldn't be too bad, but you have to fail numerous times before a move gets added. The league tables are a joke as well , instead of being called the \"Championship of Great Britain\" it should be called the \"Championship of Who Can Afford the Most Gold\". I used to love this game to the point of obsession, not now tho'.",
            "It's a really fun, cute puzzler and the challenge is good. However I disagree with some of the micro transaction tactics. Constantly being left at the end of a level being 1 move short due to the RNG of the blocks dropping from the top where you need them to line up is very frustrating and you are tempted to buy extra moves with real money which I disagree with. The fiend styles are pretty cool though and are maybe worth buying to support the game. Not extra moves!",
            "OMG, you keep changing how the game scores making it harder to earn points. Stop changing how points are earned. After 3 years of playing, I'm about to quit. I play games for fun and pleasure, not to be fustrated by playing a level repeatedly that can't be skipped. I'm going on a long break from this game. Hopefully you make it fun again when I come back. Also, File size is getting too big."

            "I've had this game for ages and love playing it but I'm very frustrated with the new update. My reason being that everytime you try to play an ad to win a free booster, the game crashes and this is really annoying...especially if you're stuck on a Nightmarishly Hard level. Please fix this so I can continue to enjoy playing the game!!!",
            "Really addictive and aestheticly pleasing. Yeah, the wait time is a bummer, but 69 gold gets 5hrs of infinite lives. So I played for a solid 2 weeks, everyday, to get the gold, which i did.. But I got busy and was going to wait to use it. So I put my phone in my pocket, finished doing things,only to sit down and turn on the game to find that THE 5HR TIMER HAD STARTED 4 HRS AGO. Apparently there is no verification to us gold?So I lost it all.i just want my wasted gold back. 1 star cause thats bs",
            "Overall I enjoy playing this game while waiting for my online classes and other stuff. I like how the lives get full while I'm waiting. FYI, I hope there's a button like where you can chat with other players while teaming up like during F5 thingy. (Just a suggestion though or maybe it's already been done when I didn't know) Though I haven't play this game for so long, I just want to catch up to my brother just to play this game.",
            "Fun addictive game. And free. I'm at over level 3000 and I've never needed to pay for boosts to win. Free boosts are there all the time. Even the premium \"gold\" can be gotten free in game. It's great for a short time or you can spend hours in a day if you want, even if you have trouble due to all the free video ad extra lives. It's the best of its kind.",
            "Good game, challenging, and great time killer. However, you work you butt of to fill the piggy bank with gold bars only to find out you have to pay cash for them. Which is quite ridiculous. You shouldn't have to spend your hard earned money on the gold you earned in the game. Also, why does the wheel to win moves have boosters in it?!? You run out of moves and the level says spin wheel to win moves, but you spin and land on a booster. Would be willing to rate a higher rating if this was changed."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "I've played this game for years; since first introduced. I literally had accumulated over a 1000 of the various boosters. The update at the end of Sept completely screwed up my game. It set me back 12 levels, & every single booster I had was gone. They sent another update a few days later with 10 gold bars. Big deal. I tried reaching out multiple times, with no reply. I uninstalled the app, & tried logging back in with FB, but it had saved me at the \"bad\" version, so no help. Garbage developers.",
            "None of the cards in the feckmatch the cards in the playing field and the key is always gone always ! This used to be a good game to play ,now you have to buy joker's and other boosters just to pass the level , not so much fun as it is aggravating . really just really ! ! ! Guess that it's time to uninstall this game. Once again ,the cards in the deck math none in the playing field ,been on this level for 2 week's F$&k this game !",
            "I have to say that after I voiced all my complaints and problems the Pyramid folks have really stepped up to the plate & listened. I have never had such great interactions and speedy fixes. I hope that this continues and that they continue with the fun and challenges by continuing to create more levels. Thank you Pyramid folks, keep up the good work. ❤",
            "Fun game but would be nice to receive daily boosters. Some of the levels are pretty difficult and once you've used what boosters you had to pass you're basically out of luck. I've deleted the game several times for that reason. I do come back in hopes that maybe they've changed so that a person can receive a daily booster but nope. Thinking of deleting again. When you have issues they don't get back to you either.",
            "Was really enjoying this until it insisted I updated. When I tried playing it again it had wiped out everything I'd done including saved levels and gone back to the first level. Really not impressed. Won't be bothering to start again, so wont play it again. Have it three stars as I did enjoy the game and would have given it more but would give it a big fat nought for wiping everything out."

Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire.

Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it.

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in.

I suggest you to download this game only other than Temple Run 2 because it's has characters, power ups and more. It's less MB also. But I have given 4 stars it is not running smoothly. The characters are very expensive. Please less the rate. And the most annoying thing is the BIGGEST DEVIL- THE ADS !!!! 😈😈😈. They come after every run and I didn't like it at all. Please remove the Ads ! Please !!!",
            "I'm gave 4stars to this game. This game is very interesting and entertainment. When I'm was bored I was started to playing this game. The man is running we have to face the rivers, rocks and gaps. And we also to collect the coins on the way of running. We have also change the characters also but we have more money. I collect 5000coins for the 1st run I bought a one new character. But other characters we can't able to bought for coins. At last this is a very interesting game for kids below 13r14.",
            "It is a very nice game. The characters are wonderful. The scenary of the environment around is awesome. But one thing's very annoying,,,the ads!!! I want the ads removed. It's really very annoying. But if I forget about the ads,then I will say that it's a wonderful and mind-blowing game",
            "I clicked on the game, it takes ages to load and then the game just completely froze. And then it went off the game back onto my home screen. All I wanted to do was play the game but it kept on doing the same thing (freezing). I am very dissapointed as I was very excited to play this game as i haven't played it in a long long time.",
            "It's an awesome game !!! I Love this game very much. The character are wonderful. But there is one reason that i didn't give it 5 star. It's because of howmany ads. Overall, a great game."

            "Way too many ads. Also not technically a pool game. No matches, competition, adversaries... This is more of a puzzle game that happens on a pool table. The levels are too easy and go by very fast so you're constantly bombarded with ads at each level change. The game itself is fun at the beginning but gets old very fast as the only thing that increases the difficulty is the shape of the table. Also some levels are identical, some the balls change colors but everything else stays the same.",
            "There are ads every level. You can't even play online and the sensitivity of the stick is really fast. I can not stand this game because I have to make the most basic shots and I gets boring pretty quick (obviously depending of the style of game you like to play). The levels are to easy and sometimes I don't every get a correct board I get curvy line all the time.I guess it's good in some respects by just a quick game before you go out. I do not recommend if you are an online type of person.",
            "This is one smooth algorithm, superb quality graphics and easy to use. In fact it works so well that I have one suggestion...could it please be a real game of pool? Two players. maybe an optional bar fight (just kidding,,then again..) please consider this as most simulation programs of real world games don't come close ..this game is only 10% off the actual sport... I hope you will consider this.. WELL DONE TEAM.",
            "Pooking is a fun game, graphically well presented. The only drawback is if you use a tablet to play the game, it is easy to touch the cue button before you have measured the strength of the force you would like to hit the cue ball with. This results in a light shot that barely notes the object ball. It happens when I rotate the tablet to get a better view of the desired angle when the object ball is far from a pocket. I find that I touch the button that releases the cue prematurely.",
            "It is the best ever, than any other game l played or have found in the internet, really lam using it for more than an year, l just wish to see it got updated and a new games have been added additionally to it,, 1020 games are not enough, please, make it 2040 or 6060 ,,, we are ready to winn the CROWNs !!! I have already won 1020 ones, but within a year or so , that means it has taken my time to get fun with it,, and that is the target l enjoy to reach !!!"

            "I was very happy with the app before, but After the last auto update to the new version all my documents are disappeared. Also I have already paid for extra features before. I am not interested in starting a subscription.",
            "10/2020 For the last several years I have used this app, but with the most recent update I'm considering removing it. The app no longer shows my documents, and still shows nothing after I try a restore. Hopefully this is a minor bug that's fixed soon.",
            "Fair warning- these guys are Grade A scammers. You know what's not fun? Rushing to turn in a paper only to have the scanning app you've been using without issues suddenly lock, with no warning, unless you pay them 20 dollars, just casually holding you hostage. In a panic, you fork over 20 dollars because what else are you gonna do? Anyway your paper ends up late, AND you're out 20 bucks. The kicker? They then ask you to rate the app. The only clickable option? 5 stars. These guys are dirtbags.",
            "Was perfect for years. Always used it to turn in homework. Now it doesn't save anything to your phone. Use CamScanner instead. It offers a student version that's way better and saves a PDF to your phone.",
            "Great app up until the update. I cannot find my tiny scan folder in my files on my android. Now I scan and can't figure out where my pdf is going. Have done everything to figure it out and cannot seem to find it."

It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",
            "New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",

All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

            "I have never quit a game the same day i started it, until now. And odds are more money is made by the ads than the players. I was excited when i started playing too many bugs and bad choices by the devs or management however.",
            "Predatory gambling and political ads ruin what could have been a fun experience. Edit - Cookie cutter reply from Devs fails to address my concerns. Gameplay is good, predatory ads for malware or gambling are not.",
            "Beginnings are fun, but later it's unplayable for free users. Too many ads, repetitive, unjust, unfair. At some point, progressing is limited to paying customers, upgrading your ships above certain levels is available only after buying crystals or cards. You don't receive enough of them during normal game. Ads can break the sound in the game, and pause your music. Free users are limited to 20 games at a time. Then you need to wait for energy to replenish.",
            "I updated the app to this latest version and lost all my ship and drone upgrades!!! That sucked biiiiiiiig time and deserved 1/5. 🌟 But the compensation received in the in-app mail was more than enough and deserves a 5-star rating...have your 5/5 🌟 as a sign of gratitude from yours truly."

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "I mostly play free style but one problem is there that player there are coward, means either they left their chance of strike and wasting time by fearing that they may open the beat so opponent get advantage. Please do something player like this. Better you implement overall game time system eg. 5 mins or 10 mins per match max so that atleast time will not be wasted.",
            "A good game. However, it encourages cheating rather than sportsmanship. Why different strikers. A person looking for another person to make game for him. Sometimes if you are given the striker to start never starts. No fine and he still wins. This game favours who make purchases. Total cheating and nothing. All matches are fixed. Had suggested times and again but no hearing from your team. It seems above facts are correct. Encourages fixing and cheating. Worst game ever i played.",
            "Good to play in spare time but few of the things are not that great about the game.. 1. You need a very good internet connection. 2. Rules should have been same as Carrom. There are certain scenarios which are not counted as a foul. E.g. Directly hittting opponen's puck and not hitting any of your pucks etc. 3. Another turn should be given in case of double fine. 4. No sportamanship at all. Players can have different strickers with more abilities. 5. 2/2 matches will be great if provided.",
            "It is a awesome game I would like to give more than 5 stars but still there are some issues in it. I think there are some hackers. After the time ran out the opponent can still operate and control striker and they pot a coin this is unfair and I also tried one time but for me it is not working after the time runs out. So please notice my issue",
            "The game is very good and it is good for time pass. I loved the concept of variour strikers and powers. It has made the look of the struke phenomenal. However, like the last month the season should be carrom pass event there for each month. So, that one should get some rewards after completing each level in the carrom pass whether they have purchased it or not. That promotes the players to play this game. I hope we will receive similar kind of update soon."

            "I don't get notifications at all anymore. It's annoying since I have to go on the app very 15mins to check if i have any messages, and it also sometimes doesn't even send despite having a good connection. Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything. Nothing works and I cannot log in. Deleted app now.",
            "I rarely get notifications of a new message. Messages are left on \"S\" despite having perfect cullar and wifi connection on both ends. Kin market no longer updates. Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",
            "Good if you know what your looking for in an existing group chat or want too make your own. The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",
            "What's up with this chat limit thing? I tried to delete the cache, i stoped the app several times. I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",
            "This app is not what it used to be. The sheer amount of bots have really ruined the experience. Remove one and 2 or 3 more flood in right behind them. I report each and every one of them but I suspect nothing is really being done about it, which is a shame because this used to be my favourite app."

            "Game is fun, but its hard pay to play, even spend some money to buy better plane but that was enough only for 20 lvl's, and there is 200+ lvls, if u want to move after that its pay to play, really hard progress without spending alot of money, i get the devs needs to get paid, but this is too much, getting diamonds should be really increased or decreased the items that cost alot, as i c it now will never get pass lvl 50, so probabbly gonna give this game, and find simillar cheaper game",
            "The game is fun, until you realize it is not just difficult. It is stupid difficult. After you get to level 100. You will start figuring out that in order to move any further, you will need to start dropping some $$$ on the game to upgrade/obtain better aircrafts and weapons to defeat even easy levels. Fun for a while but just don't invest your time/money past level 100. But the hook is real and the developers knows it.",
            "This game went from pretty good to absolutely screwed up in one update, which it took 2 more updates to even get working. They reduced the power of everything, took all our devices we had earned or bought and deleted them and gave us credits for the new stuff, which wasn't close to worth the amount of work we put in to it. Stay clear of this game Another update and it still sucks. This has no gone from a free game to pay to play. AS IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS Stay clear of this app.",
            "In multi-player your opponents are allowed to use all their planes even though they have a far lower rank than you, Dumb AF! Then when I updated it stopped letting me collect the vip points. Used to be able to watch a video to collect up to 20 points a day, not now though. It still has vip points as part of the game, but now there is no way to earn them. Unless you pay. GAME USED TO BE GOOD befor they made it PAY TO PLAY!",
            "UPDATE: 10-23-2020. The developers got back in touch with me and release a update. The problem has been fixed!!! 4 stars! OLDER REVIEW; This game is fun and I would love to spend money on it. But it is glitchy with its' pop ups. And no I'm not talking about ads. I'm just talking about regular in game menus. For example; after I successfully complete a mission flawlessly. It will then give me the ability to watch a ad for extra coins. I do that, then I click continue. Once I'm back at the main screen, it then will pop up with, \"here is a special deal\" or \"congrats you went up a rank.\" But then it will permanently freeze the game. Even if I hit okay on this pop up, it just stays there with the sound of the game in the background playing and the green okay button recognizing that I'm hitting okay. However the menu stays up and I can't even back out of it. So I have to close the app using my phone instead and then re login back into the game. PLEASE FIX THIS!"

            "This app is a poorly engineered solution to a fake problem. Android comes with an excellent visual voicemail system, and it worked great for years, right up until T-Mobile shut down their support for it and made me install this piece of s--t. Update Oct 2020: It's now even worse. Every time I start it, it tells me it has to delete all my voicemails because it's \"associated to a different account.\" It then tries to sell me \"text to speech.\" At least now I know why it exists. It's a money grab.",
            "Breaking third party integration so they can charge $4 a month is about as \"carrier\" a move as you could make. Voice to text isn't worth $4/mo, but it angers me that the so called uncarrier is ruining the capability for customers using third party apps. To top it off, this app they try to force on you is buggy. Late messages, annoying and pointless notifications, trying to trick you into extra fees. Too bad we don't have an FCC willing to protect consumers from scummy companies like TMobile.",
            "Don't know what happened but finally this app is doing what it's supposed to. I now receive notifications of new voicemails and haven't received the Dreaded daily error in about a month. 3 stars so far as I shall wait to see if this app continues to work. Still, in one way sad that my expectations were so low that now that I can receive a voicemail ( something that should be so simple) I'm excited about it.",
            "Worse voicemail set up I have ever used!! It just flat CANNOT be depended on. Shame on t-mobile for not paying attention to consumers and not doing something about this! Just read the reviews! The factory voicemail set-ups that come with phones (samsung, ect ect) work perfectly fine. This stupid app is a joke. Come on t-mobile....figure it out!!",
            "Terrible performing app. Never get new voicemail notifications/sync on time. I always have to go into the app and manually refresh it to watch the loading wheel turn and turn until finally the voicemail appears. Often buggy and doesn't always find the voicemail when refreshing it. Very frustrating after previously having an iPhone with wonderful visual voicemail built in."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "I've got to say this game is sick. I really want more American muscle cars in it and maybe some classic trucks. But there are a few problems like the rims just turning orange and the tires catch on fire \"like really\" but the gameplay and controls are very good. It is also very difficult to unlock new cars if you dont just grind for hours upon hours. Please make it a little easier to unlock and buy cars. Also why do you have to buy the real life cars? Why cant i buy them with in game money.",
            "Great game, ive been playing for a week now and I love it. Drifting feels real and you dont have To pay to win like most other games. The only thing i would make better are the engine idleing sounds in the garage and the revving sounds in game. Over all great game just those two things.",
            "I have a problem. in real life when you're Tyre pops you're rim probably will blow cause of all the intense heat it's taking so add that to the game. a few more cars, and make it so that you're engine doesn't blow in like 1 minute that has been a big problem for me cause I always get my engine blown and have to drive a taxi. but over all its... A GOOD GAME!",
            "The game is fab. You could add a bit of more Germand made cars, like for instance the BMW e30 325i. In South Africa its a well known car and in such a game you could actually get more people wanting to get the game. So try and add that and the proper engine sound for it and you will see how more people will be downloading this game",
            "I rlly love this game, you guys put alot of effort in the fame but I'm unsatisfied with a feature not in the game, If its possible, can u make all the cars have custom features sucks as bumpers,hoods, side skirts, wings, ect. Thy which ive given 4 stars but i still like the game, and ive bought your products in game"

I have the HP 5520 all in one printer, I printed off the test page which printed BLANK! GOOD START. I have just tried another 2 different prints, both blank pages..

It was fine till the update, nothing wrong on my end. It will connect and recognize the printer over WiFi and direct-connection but when you get to the print screen the icon to start print (blue printer icon) is gone!! Checked print services, cleared cache, all should be well and it's not!! Please fix!!!",

            "I enjoy this game, very addictive!Recommend it to everyone wanting to play and improve their brain. I disagree with those claiming that at some level you must use money. I have played this game for years and refuse spend a dime. I have patience and detrrminationand try to learn from the failures. Usually do.Just give us more FREE weapons. Great game!",
            "Very beautyful game. But in the championship game i want not to lose my progress.Why? As in football, and in other games , and in this championship ,the tickets that we collect is not, good to cancel.The best player,is he , who , for 48 ours ,play and win more games that enother player. .For example ! I collect 3 ,tickets in, 3 games.When I go in 4 game ,the colors are not in my favore ,so the progress stop.But is not right, to lose the tickets.",
            "Hello King. GLITCH! Level 730! I beat a player and it still will not let me progress. Why incorporate sudden forced competitions into a game I've been playing for so long? AND if you're going to do so.. why not make it optional only? If this issue isn't cleared by morning I am uninstalling and KING won't get another dime from me. Ridiculous and unfortunate. It was a good game.",
            "The game is fun to play but the Royal Championship is somehow unfair. It always unfavor players who are one win away from getting the treasure boxes. The other player would have an advantage because they would be given opportunities for combos and would normally win after a few moves. There should be fairness in giving out combos so that the game should be fair. Edit:It's so unfair that everytime I'm near getting the chest box, I always get disconnected or there's a problem with the game.",
            "Stuck at level 60. It's blatantly obvious that this is one of those levels that is intended to make you pay. They will not give you what you need to progress until after 30 to 40 times of going through this level they get sick of looking at you and give you what you need until you hit the next one which is intended to force you to pay. I've found this with this company many times before and I'm not surprised it's in this one as well."

I seemed to notice that if a level is finished with race bonus, you don't seem to be able to go back to that level. This makes the game to end if all levels are finished. Apart from that everything is awesome. If you want to download any bike game, I recommend this for you.",
            "This is a good game that deserves 5 stars, even more than 5 stars. But the only problem is that when one gets to a certain level, it frequently freezes while playing and this is irritating. I uninstalled it and reinstall it after 8 months with another phone; same problem persists. Pls.try to fix this. Thanks.",
            "Great game ! Fantastic graphics, good bikes. The one problem is that I can't play multi-player, but it's OK. And one that you cannot play the next chapter unless you cross the particular level while the level cannot be completed everytime in previous chapter that's why I m giving it 4 stars . The thing I like is that in every chapter there is a boss race in ending.",
            "This game is good but somehow dont let me pass level 12 even though I crossed it so many times and I go on level 13 but when I exit the app and go back there after few hours or refresh it, it makes me come back to level 12 which is annoying and frustrating. Please let me know how to fix that and why doesnt it save my already done levels. Thanks.",
            "I had never seen such a fantastic graphic game in a smartphone before.Hats off to the producers for this extra ordinary game. I will recommend everyone to play this game.But i'm giving 4 stars because the developer got the bikes' level wrong. For example, Ninja H2R is the current fastest bike, but they got a BMW 1000RR infront of the ninja. That doesnt make sense. So i request the producers to make a real-study on the bikes and make some improvement. Only this one got me annoying.."

            "Where are the functions of editing pictures such as merger of photos, opacity, embossing etc etc. My devise has Canva since a long time but I didn't try. Today I decided to see what Canva offering different to other creative Apps and Im disappointed to see there's not much we can do to create something amazing. Even the basic editing functions like frames, borders, choice of fonts, alignments etc are missing. Or perhaps, I may be unable to find those functions, any help would be much appreciated",
            "I was totally enjoying the app so much! I was using it pretty much everyday between computer and phone until the last update. That just messed everything up. I really hope you guys bring back the editing functionality between computer and phone. I'm still paying my subscription to not fully use it anymore.",
            "Meh, or if you like subscription services ... There are free items, but at least on my screen the \"free\" is so tiny, so it is hard to easily find free items- and this was just trying it out. I also had to create an account to do so... I used a non free background , and to save it would cost 1.99 or signing up for a \"free\" 14 day trial, which by the way if you forget to cancel,the monthly and yearly fees are hefty-$14.99 and $119.99 I think it said. Maybe if you have an expense account?",
            "Samsung Tablet Unfriendly (Tab S7). When installed this app via Play Store, it won't go to Landscape mode. When installing this app via Galaxy Store, the design layouts are always wrong. BUT when viewing the same design on browser or Canva app downloaded from Play Store, it looks properly aligned. When design is downloaded, it looks proper, too.",
            "A really great platform to create simple visuals. Plenty of options and easy to work with. I use the paid version and the only thing that's a huge minus is that from mobile I can't access the photo folders that I have created on my computer, meaning from mobile I can use only photos on my phone. Another annoying bug is if I search for photos in my phone folders and select one to be used in a pre-made template, it sometimes doesn't save the photo in the template and I gave to look for it again."

            "Constantly crashing...... this app would allow you the odd video for a booster or extra few moves, but every video link crashes the app which means you lose where you were, and can't progress anywhere. I get the whole idea is to encourage you to buy etc, but the app should still function. Really tempted to just give up. Shame, had been a good boredom buster up to this point.",
            "Candy Crush Soda Saga is the best and fun game i've ever played...it has so so many levels that you can play...some are hard and some are easy to play...i really never thought that i could play this game as i'm playing it now..level 920 isthe hardest level in the game but is fun to play it again and again...",
            "I used to enjoy the game. But, as you progress the levels, the fish are of no use. It seems like they deliberately go to the wrong places when you are in the final moves of any hard level. This leads to the loss of streak as well. Why are the fishies acting all weird?!!",
            "At first is a interesting game, but once you've got to hard level, became really bad and boring for that reason your lucky that i give you 1 star. ..but I won't spend my money buying, life's, this game really this game really sucks cause freeze every time once you reach higher level. ..fix the problem if you're charging all those gifts..what about golden reward? I I hate it when I get to higher level past 100 it freezes and I have to uninstal the game..",
            "Its like when you are playing the game, it wants you to use their moves, which may be way up at the top of the board., and its ludicrous to use their moves, that they are trying to make u use. Thats using up your tries. Makes no sense to use their moves suggestions. And if you don't use their suggestion, they make it difficult to try your own moves, it will get stuck until u use their moves. Almost said their dumb suggestions, because they want you to fail. I earned 13 gold bars, r gone. ."

            "Love the game but shouldn't have to pay for more coins. Should get them on the wheel sometimes. Never do. Free play time clock should stop until you get back to play. Can't play 24 hours straight. I want to, but humanly impossible. Fix that please. Thank you for responding! I got the coins on my last spin. Great! Still need to fix the free play we get. I had several hours but fell asleep before I could play. Lost the remaining time. Please fix that. Thanks!!!!",
            "The constant attempts to sell you more lives and game time is beyond annoying. Also, games seemingly are programmed for you to lose with only one move left, trying to frustrate you into buying more moves. Update: Sure, you don't have to purchase additional game time or moves, but I could also walk from Chicago to New York all without having to pay for gas, bus fare, or a plane ticket. Just like I will eventually arrive at my destination, I will also eventually complete the game level.",
            "I have had this game for awhile, but recently it's become frustrating that lives do not regenerate. I will play at night, run out of lives, and the next morning there are still 0 lives. Sometimes I can restart my phone and it resolves, other times, nothing works. It's only a fun game when you can actually play it. :(",
            "Used to love this game, until it became a money eater. Not really as much fun now, especially since the pandemic, when I don't have the extra money, try to play for a stress reliever, Not more stress. Now won't even give daily bonus even if You log in Every Day, when You get so far, it cuts You Off because You won't pay for more, SAD...",
            "Love this game! ❤ ever since update, you don't receive extra spins and always get the same things. You very seldom receive the coins. Now its even harder to win the new air ships. I haven't won a new since July, just not fun like it use to be. Now you have win 30 levels to win an Air Ship. Not fun at all...you do the Cookie walk no coins, and again no extra spins. Really thinking about getting rid of the game. So disappointing."

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

Not the first time Canon apps have disappointed me. Had the same problem with their camera app. I'll be thinking twice before buying another Canon product. Even if it's a good deal.",
            "Not \"quick and easy\" or functional... Installed the app. Upon opening the app, a static instructional page is displayed telling me to print from outside the app. Moving on to print a document, I select the canon option that now appears from the list of printers and get a nearly blank screen asking for the printer's IP address (unable to be detected itself from it's WiFi function) Searching Canon's troubleshooting page, I end up printing out a configuration page from the printer's menu, and I type in the IP address from a sheet of paper. The confirmation button stays greyed out. My only option is to cancel and delete the app. Because apparently it's just a waste of time.",
            "I'm disappointed that double-sided printing is not supported. The option is present but greyed out. I raised the issue with Canon support but their unhelpful response was \"if the option is greyed out then it is not supported\" even though the printer does do double-sided printing when used with other products, just not the Canon Print Service!",
            "The latest update removed functionality of the print service for me and my MG6220. The app/service (which now needlessly forces an icon into the Apps list) no longer automatically finds my printer, and when I try to manually find it by IP address, the app opens a numeric-only keyboard (no way to input decimal points for the address!).",
            "I will Never buy another Canon anything again!!!!! When I first got the pixma it worked pretty good. But ever since August it has a mind of its own! It will print one page then grab 50 pieces of paper at once from the paper tray! The next time it won't print at all. I got the Ivy cliq ( for free) and it works on its own but to try and get it to print pictures from your phone? Forget it. I give up! Done with Canon!!"

            "Great for those idle moments at the various jobs I've worked. It's a fun twist of a platform runner type of game. The different gun sounds are also quite entertaining. Not to mention hearing \"HEADSHOT\" the way the game does it is satisfying. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something complex, but other than that I enjoy it.",
            "Honestly, I got bored of this after a while so I deleted it, but I hot it back today and it's just how I remember it. It's a pretty fun game. It's simple but fun. Turn in airplane mode if you don't want any ads but you won't get any skins or free guns. Other than that I'm done rating for now. All in all I think this would be a good download for you",
            "Not a bad game. There's quite a few ads, but that's expected from a free game. Gameplay is repetitive but still fun. My issue is with updates. It's been months since there has been an update to story mode, hideout, or gun skins. There hasn't even been new guns or outfits to unlock in the weekly challenge. It's just hammers to unlock, which is pointless when I already have the hideout built completely.",
            "The game is very fun. The ads are reasonably spaced out, about one every 2-3 levels. The gameplay is fun, and you are able to pick how you want to play. The different guns don't have that much of an impact on the difficulty, allowing you to pick your favorite gun, regardless of how much damage it says it does, because everyone except the occasional boss goes down in one hit.",
            "I like the looks of it, but all the movement is automated. The only thing you do is tap the screen when your laser gets on the targets. If I controlled more of the game, I'd like it better. But the concept and art is on point."

            "The actual game is entertaining and fun. There is a lot more to it than I thought. The main problem I had was the lack of notch support. I am running the game on my Pixel 3XL and some of the screen is cut off. It doesn't hinder the gameplay specifically but it's hard or impossible to see the achievements that pop up for nitro boost. Overall the gameplay is fun, and I've enjoyed it.",
            "I gave this app 5 star, perhaps for the improvement to the game in betterments of graphics, more sports bikes and motoGP racing characters, make bikes' meter console little realistic. Characters needs to lean more in high speed so that it will looks so much better like a real life. Top speed and the breaks are amazing but the handling needs to improve. I think vehicles are too much on the highway. For me Maps are really good, if include isle of Man tt map this will be the best moto racing game❤️",

            "It used to be good, but now I seem to have noticed that: The cue balls mysteriously bounce back out or don't go in when it is a clear shot. The power meter is a hit or miss-it doesn't shoot when you intend to and you then have to pull it again which then messes up the direction of your shot (half your time has gone by then). There are too many cheaters. Too many players abusing the connection function to waste time in the game. 8 Ball Pool Popups every few seconds are annoying.",
            "Was having a good entertaining experience, when all of a sudden don't know for what reason all my progress just vanished. Tried to reach the developers but they have not responded till yet. My level which was 41suddenly backed to 5. All my winnings were gone. Was expecting a prompt help for the same. But it seems the developers are no more intrested in good reviews. I am really disappointed.",
            "Love 8 ball pool !!! I loved the pool pass ,but couldn't afford to buy anything. But love playing for it. It's been updated a lot to improve it . That's a plus!!! I love 8 ball and 9 ball, but like others on here , some of the things happening are unbelievable, balls just hanging on the edge , the cue moving when it was aimed to shoot, and coins disappearing!!! And other players stealing your turn, and your coins. Please fix this stuff happening. A true patriot of 8 Ball Pool. Love it !!!",
            "The game was good when I started playing it but now that I've progressed it's like your playing a robot, perfect shot, perfect english on the ball, every shot just perfect. Don't waste your money buying coins trying to advance quicker it doesn't help, you'll only lose them quicker and have to buy more. The weekend games are usually won by the same people if you watch the standings. A perfect bank shot will run off course like the table isn't level, did it today!!",
            "Constantly hangs up. After an update the program became worse. It only allows me 2 seconds to play and then switches players. It does not record a ball made. It replayed the same player when i chose not to. It never allowed me to play, it hanged up for 3 minutes and it ended the game and the other player won. I'm ready to abandon this game. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!"

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "I like this game so much but after the Halloween update, it looks like it needs more data and I can't play a smooth game🙁 Sometimes when I earn so much coins, suddenly it will show like 'Talking Tom Hero Dash isn't responding'. And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "Push notifications declaring I have matches and should start conversation only to get in and there's nothing. Either don't do the push notifications like that until they've been there a little, or if it's bugging, fix it; I don't mind if someone unmatches but I'd rather know that's why they're not showing up so I'm not left thinking the app is sabotaging it? Definitely wouldn't spend money on it like that.",
            "Totally miserable experience. Repetitive match suggestions, they keep appearing even after I reject them. Overpriced super expensive extras. All my matches, conversations, media and settings were lost after a website update - I was unable to continue with my connections - no reaction from support. And that was a paid \"gold\" account! Complete waste of money, time and energy.",
            "Wouldn't recommend. Dudes swipe right, in order to match but don't talk. It makes no sense. If you're interested in someone and match them, why be unresponsive? It is very immature and wastes everyone's time. Therefore I am giving a low rating. There's great potential, but people need to stop being immature and actually talk to their matches.",
            "Installed the app and cannot log on either with Facebook, phone or email. Constant errors keep popping up when trying to log into an existing account. Edit October 2020. Since found out I have been banned from Tinder. When I spoke to them, they will not tell me why I have been banned and they didn't do appeals. How can you ban someone and not tell them why or to even get their side of the story!!!",
            "Ive been on tinder acouple of times in the past and it was easy without and real problem or bug. I downloaded it again last night and it won't open and keeps saying \"we're experiencing some issues\". Who's messed around with it? I mean there's no actual chance of meeting anyone on there, but it was perfectly fine and straightforward before."

            "I have played this game now for around 2 years and loved it until last week. Every time you watch a video for extra items, lives or to play on at the end of a level the game crashes. I have completed everything they recommend and even reinstalling this and still crashes. I have now lost all my lollipop hammers (10 of each). Messaged them (King) and not willing to help or admit there is a problem which clearly there is from others comments below. Very disappointed after all this time.",
            "Sometimes you can watch a video to either have a special candy or to get a few extra moves, however quite frequently when the watch video button is clicked, it just shuts the app down completely. It would be 5 stars if it wasn't for this really annoying bug. Please fix and I'll change my rating.",
            "Game is always crashing. Sometimes I don't get rewards after watching adds. Events never work. And it's impossible to contact anyone about it. I've tried and I got a copie pasted email back. Useless. Update, a few days after writing my review I lost all my candy ( the lollipops) that I've been collecting for years. Literally Year. Gone",
            "I have been playing this for a while now, and it does get tricky every now and then, but it is very playable . However this morning, when the game loads, then the level screen, then play, then watch video, the game shuts itself off! And then back to starting the app again, has this been caused by an update, as last night it worked perfectly. Overall my impressions are good, nice graphics, pleasing sounds, some levels do get annoying, but that is all part of the game, 85/100.",
            "Great game with lots of free treats. You can get stuck for 2 or 3 days though, even on a classic level,. 7 months later I'm still playing but now it switches off when I try to download an ad. I've taken advice to switch off my tablet completely but it has not improved. Pity because it's a great game."

            "challenging & interesting game. Certain levels are too challenging for the simple minded like me! Tempted to give up many times as it's too time consuming! 😢Don't understand why the gold bars are not available for use even though the piggy bank has been full many times. Getting too difficult to complete a level, impossible in fact for hours on end. Very tempted to give up all together & try other games. Getting to a stage where it's too time consuming to complete a level. Losing interest.",
            "This game is fun sometimes, until you have one left and you lose. This game is rigged. Cause they can give you what you need if there is only one left, but they want you to spend money, and when you do spend a little money, you would expect to get cheaper prizes and better prizes. Y'all need to do something about it because im getting annoyed when that happens after I've spent $30 or $40, im expecting better results with my spending",
            "Been Playing for 10 years and I'm obsessed with this game. I love the animals and the challenges, I have gotten all of the animals in the game w/o really putting 5$ in and playing on/off for so many years. So Its a great game with great side games you can play for hours. To the Developers I would like to see more of the level streak boost. For every level you pass you get boosters on your next like the candy crush sagas have. Thank You if you made it here!",
            "Great game until you reach the pay wall level. Move the sheep to the hay.. yeah when the game decides that you're allowed to. No information provided on how to move the sheep, thought I'd got the last sheep to the hay with my last move but NOOOO.. game decides that the same move I'd made with the previous sheep was not allowed. 100% designed like this so you spend money. Well not me. Deleted. As with candy crush take your game and SHOVE IT!!!!",
            "fun till it started cheating😡When it starts cheating again I will uninstall it again. It is ok for awhile then it cheats. Funny that the cheating starts when a player reaches higher levels. I am not going to pay for gold bars I have \"WON.\" A lot of time is wasted on ads and other nonsense. I spend mote time watching dumb ads than playing...boo!"

            "This is a very fun and addicting game, I love all of the features but I would recommend to add some features like:- 1. Creating an account and having the same name, but you can change it anytime you want, so by having an account we can add friends. 2. Add a voice feature for more fun, but still the chat feature should be there for people uncomfortable to talk. 3. Changing the amount of impostors and changing the map while being in the lobby as people misclick usually. I hope you can add this.",
            "Great game. Has clearly grown in popularity since lockdown: almost everyone i know is playing it! I have a few improvements though that may make the game more enjoyable for people (like me) who cant spend money in games. One thing i would suggest is adding 'achievements', so that players can unlock some pets, skins, etc. Of course, you could also buy them with real money, but this gives people a chance to earn them instead of buying them. Also, seasonal kill animations would be cool. (Xmas, etc)",
            "I honestly didn't get the point of it all, until I played it. The game is great! And as an app is even better! Getting used to the controls takes a bit of time, but it's surprisingly user friendly. My only problem so far has been with the keyboard (it blocks the entire screen and is really slow, but only ingame) and how other apps, specifically Messenger, can't display over it.",
            "Very fun and addictive game!! However there are a few bugs and tips I could give. For me there is a glitch as the imposter where someone will report a body or call a meeting, but, I will hear the chat going off but im still playing the game, and everyone is frozen. Idk if that has happend to anyone else but if you could fix that that would be great! And also being a ghost is kind of boring. If you could give the ghost some extra things to do that would also be great. Other that that great game!",
            "The game is amazing. Love the simplicity of the game, very enjoyable when playing with friends. Which brings up the topic of a friend system, sometimes it's hard to gather close friends. You can often meet some great people in lobbies, but the only problem is you cannot add them to play in the future which is a shame because this can definitely keep the community growing/make players stay. Love the game none the less. (Also hoping to see more add ons/maps in the future!!)"

Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

            "I have been playing this game for a while now and ive been enjoying it, ive got most of the characters and its great for killing time. The one thing that drives me NUTS is the fact that you when there is an enerbeam with an object directly in front of it you somehow knock into the object, lose your coins and then it takes you on the enerbeam, how the hell do you knock into it when you're meant to have already caught the beam. I am left furios every time it happens. I would give 5 stars otherwise",
            "I would totally love this game but there are bugs that have made me very upset. 1. I had last play about 6pm then played again at 10:30pm and about 100 of my redstar rings were missing and only had 31 left. 2. At times I will use the watch add to revive and add will not pull up. I had several times where my run did not count because I had to quit my run because of this. 3. Combos at times ended when they should not have 4. Glitch drop from sky 5. Rail swing from sky won't work right at time",
            "Game is great. I like it better than the first tbh. Graphics are good, controls are good, even the music is good. The only thing I'm concerned is the characters. I'm not saying the characters are not good. I'm saying that this game has came out about 4 years ago but there's still no new characters. I'm starting to think that Sega forgot about the characters or just not worrying about it. But anyway it's a great game",
            "Fun game, can be very addicting. Very glitchy app. If you \"die\" it frequently gets stuck and you cannot continue without closing the game out all together and restaring, which causes you to lose all progress. That's extremely frustrating.",
            "This is a really good game! However, there is a bug I noticed where if you hit an obstacle at high speed (not dashing) you will go through the object as the run ends."

            "This is my favorite truck driving game, good controls, challenging, lots of fun, the only bad thing is while you're driving the ads that pop up at the top of the screen and stay there while you're driving makes the game lag so bad you can't hardly control or play the game ,So if you could Please fix this problem, I would Definitely give 5 stars",
            "The game is okay. But there are a lot of ads. The controls are hard because they are so small. The triangles for turning are okay but they are tiny so it makes it harder. Half the time i try to hook up to a trailer the truck and trailer collide causing damage on the truck and it wont hook so i have to exit out of the game to reset it so hopefully the next time i watch 5 ads to get in it will hook to a trailer. The game iver all is fun but every time i stop to get fuel, at the scale, or to sleep",
            "When you try to hook up the load most of the time it acts like your hitting something or your truck just goes right threw the load, very frustrating!! And you can't see the red lights even when zoomed in, please fix these problems! Other than that great game, I will give 5 stars, when fixed, thanks.",
            "The gameplay is superb. But needs some improvement in graphics and make it a bit more realistic. The game also needs 6-lane roads and new places in the map. Overall this has the best handling among all the other simulators. Also, everytime I go to Nashville, I'm charged with a speed ticket, no matter how slow or how fast I am. I have been playing this since 2017 and still cant get enough. Although now a little bored with gfx and maps.",
            "Couldn't play the game for more than 15 seconds without an ad. And why would I want to pay for an ad free experience if I haven't had an opportunity to try the game. Also, the game requests access to contacts, and wants permission to make and manage phone calls which seems odd for a game like this."

            "I installed this app on my account for the first time back in 2014, at the time I paid to get all services unlocked and it was great it was only a one time payment.... the app kept growing and improving, mostly because they added a cloud service. In 2019 I decided to pay monthly just because I needed to sign a document. After I realized I could sign any document in pdf with a pdf reader I decided to stop paying. So what happens with the money I paid a long time ago? Do I need to pay monthly?",
            "It was dumb of me to rate this app 4 stars, specially when most of then times I try to share my work on Google classroom, it shows a blank class which frustrates me. The ads are annoying and also the sharing is so slow, it buffers for 5 minutes, and no, my WiFi Isn't the problem here. Don't use this app specifically when you are sending work last minute, it delays you.",
            "I did not upgrade so I guess I am way ahead of the game, I still have a very usable cam scanner. However, yesterday I tried to use the scanner that I have used for so many years and it simply would not allow me to go through the program to a finished downloadable product. Constantly asking me to subscribe. I have given up. It allows a download for free but it can not be used for free. No more for me. I will find something else.",
            "It's like having acrobat, printer, pdf creator, microsoft picture manger in one. Super easy to just click the high qualitypic of the document/ card/qr code etc. and customize it if you want, send in as a jpg or pdf reduce size and share via different platforms like Gmail/ messages/ fb etc.. all these in less than a minute..",
            "Too expensive. I use this app occasionally for scanning documents. Wanted to support the developer and buy a \"Pro\" version. Turns out that Premium is $50 bucks a year! No way! So instead of receiving a reasonable payment of, say, $4.99 (which is what they should be charging) they get nothing. Oh well! ☹️"

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

            "At first it was nice to use , it was good but I was surprised that it didn't take 24hours where many people chatted with you and then suddenly I was fooling around I couldn't get in just loading in loading . Until , I let it go first and it took 24hours like that , so I though I would log out first but it was even harder for me because I could not open my account , it always turned out that my email add was blocked and I did not commit any violation . I'm so disappointed to install this apps 😒",
            "Every 24 hours, the app blocks my account. I have not broken any terms and conditions but still I get blocked out of my own account. Very frustrating as they don't even give you a warning. I hot blocked in the middle of conversations and didn't even get a chance to exchange information with the people I liked. All day I'm bombarded by disgusting messages from men but they don't get blocked. When I signed in using a different email, the same men found me again and messaged me.",
            "Every since the first time I used this app it was pretty chill and fun too. But then after the first time I went live the app has been crashing since yesterday. I go on the app for 3 seconds and the app crashes. It took me almost 30 minutes just to get the app to stop crashing so much this morning to finally get my live stream to work. But now I can even go on the app to the setting or nothing bc the app crashes in 3 seconds or less everytime I try to use the app.",
            "It's a very awsome app, giving the user the ability to meet alot of new and exciting people. The only problem that I have discovered so far is often the app refuses to allow the connection between myself and another party hopefully this error corrects itself when or if I switch to a better service provider, other than that it's awesome. Good job team SKOUT keep up the good work. We love you",
            "V 6.28.0 is broken on my note 20 ultra 5g. Once it goes through the \"pledge\" things everything breaks. The screen frequently refreshes and forces to the meet tab and crashes when navigating the chat messages. I installed a 6.26.0 apk and it was OK until it auto updated and broke again. I've now disabled auto updates and reverted back again to 6.26.0. I've sent a crash report, fix it!"

My game stopped at 3420 also. Do you have a fix for this problem? Why are other reviewers way beyond 3420? Older versions that haven't been updated? Are the developers doing anything about this. I want to continue this game, but it has stopped. Please help.",
            "Love the game, but it has a ad between every level, sometimes 2 or 3. i'm on level 1415 & the 3 star system does not make any sense. Otherwise, i would have given 5 stars. Update: I have watched the facebook add 2840 plus times & I'm still not going to join facebook. So give the players a break sometimes.",

I am up in the 1400s. most times it does not want to load. i give it a Cpl days and it will finally load. when I finish a game and all the balls go up then into the chutes at the bottom., i notice that my score stops going up before the balls have all gone in. this is my problem with this game..

The problem is that it has difficulties finding user's location, which means you have to wait longer until the app finds you, and it won't let you choose your address manually as in other similar apps or simply write it. I haven't been able to use it lately, because it doesn't find my location and while waiting for it, it uses a lot of your data. Please fix it!",
            "The app is safe and great most of the times. But sometimes, in the peak hours, looks like the app assign a service without the authorization of the car driver, when I had called those call drivers to ask why are they moving in other direction, they said they didn't accepted the service and the app assigned it. This makes the person to lose time waiting for a car that is not going to arrive.",

            "The money you can spend in this game is insane. Great base game but not backed up by fixing glitches or snags on the levels. I've contacted support previously and explained some snags in the game but it's still a real issue. Really disappointing. Using a different phone now, oneplus6. Installed and uninstalled multiple times and it won't even run after spending well over £100 on in-game purchases.",
            "It's a very good game, with realistic ragdoll effect and sound effects. Its great for killing time. I have a slight problem though. Sometimes when my character falls of his bike, his body can occasionally glitch out or get stuck through obstacles. Please can you fix these issues. Thank you for keeping the explosives, very nostalgic touch as I remember playing Trial Xtreme 3 and it was awesome!",
            "It's a free-mium game, but it's never so challenging that you're forced to spend money. No ads unless you choose to watch one which is really nice, and the app isn't pushy at all (doesn't make you feel pressure to spend actual currency). Overall I'll give it 4 stars.",
            "Do yourself a favour and don't download it very inconsistent with its maps, one time the planks will break going full speed then other times you drive into them and It doesn't brake. To up grade you bikes takes along time. Very poorly matched with othere players to race against them when they have the top tier bike and you only have the start up bike so you can't get money to upgrade",
            "I love this game but the only thing that I hate about it is that it's really really hard to get free coins because you guys have kids playing this game and a lot of kids don't have money or a bank card or a card in general so the only thing that I asked for you guys is to make it more easier to get but other than that the game is pretty funny."

            "I love this game it's really fun to play and has great maps, trucks and graphics for a mobile game. Only reason for the low star rating is cause it took everything I bought and worked really hard to unlock after I logged out of Google play and logged back in a few days later and updated the game. I would give 5 stars if and when the developers can help me fix this issue. Update- These guys are amazing they couldn't get my trucks back so they refunded my cash now I can buy them back and fix it.",
            "I love this game, (Not Impressed loosing all the progress I covered playing )has some old school trucks that take me back with new ones. Very fun to play and can be quite challenging. I would like to see more levels like a sand or beach like setting. Would still like to see some more types of trucks. Like Taurus, Excalliber , Samson, Awesome Kong, or some new ones like Big Kahuna, Avenger, Bone Shaker, Grave Digger. I could name more. 👍 I'm looking forward to the games future !!",
            "I love this game. I have played it for years. May I suggest a couple of things? I would love a couple of bull trucks like el toro but again not them because of licensing. I would also love a dump truck. Also I would love to see old arena style tracks without dirt. Again great game I look foward to other stuff you add.",
            "Wow.This game is easily a 5 star. The graphics the controls and the physics are amazing. I would want to see a MTD2. It would be cool if we can actually customize and create our own monster trucks! We would be able to customize our tires, the shape of our monster truck, the color, ect. Also a track maker. Thank you for a amazing game. Oh, also it is cool that you added a settings button that can change how good you want the graphics to be. 😁",
            "Fix the lag and freezing!!!! But the game is still the best monster truck game ever made🚙🚚🚛.by the way can you make a track that is actually the Las Vegas track because i have unlocked all the tracks and want something different. PS this is actually Ang's son Keanu.👍👍👍👍. Now there's a couple more things I need to tell you. Can you make these trucks. Chalkboard chuck, captain's curse and could you make an odd games monster truck as well. Bye the way when will the next update coming out.🤔"

            "Some things I noticed + compared to CR:OB 1) Story. It's...mediocre at best. Pretty simple; guy comes in, steals candy, you gotta go get it and restore the place. CR has many originals. Take inspo.! 2) Gameplay. Almost exactly like CR's. Same mechanics and almost the exact same power ups. Even the jelly/candy collecting is the same. Some lag, you get hit once and you're done, jumping animation is a bit long. 3) Characters. Multiple characters to choose from like CR. Needs more variety.",
            "Very good game... like the other outfit 7 games, it is also interesting... just before I was playing the \"Talking Tom Friends\" and that game became boring after playing it during around 70 days.. therefore I installed this game as I know the talking games are very much simple and fresh minded... Continue your God blessing work.. 🧚🌼👼👼. My favourite character is angela because she runs smoothly and her look is overall very good. The music of the game is also perfect.The graphics is awesome.",
            "( who are reading this comment please read fully)i have many tom games ,because i like the grapics , the characters and they are sooo cute and concept are nice ,but in the tom hero dash it takes too much time . the game is soo nice but it takes lot of time to load . i posted this in tom hero dash also but no response so posting in this fun game. ok please check it . bye",
            "It is so cute wow the the graphics it is greatest game till now I loved it cutie. Thankyou so much for making it offline I love the fact that when if one player out than other player continue running I will definitely recommend it to my friends too.

            "This is very addictive for me, so I must limit my time playing. When I win prizes of extended free time playing, I really wish it would go to game options (as with the boosters voices) so I can use it on my schedule. Last night, I got a one hour free games on the last intended game for the evening. I did play a bit longer, but not the full time.",
            "Sometimes l feel like the game is too hard and rigged against the player. I don't mind hard, l just don't enjoy impossible. I don't understand the value or purpose of all of the icons, likebear heads, belts, etc. Can they be used for extra turns? I don't what the points are used for in the game. I need more information.",
            "Against my better judgment I updated the app this weekend...I was at level 1067, after the update I was at 0. Did the log in to Facebook thing and it got me back to 1067. But now the game doesn't work. Only thing I can do is the mini game trying to get 3stars(added).few days later.. I decided to try and play on facebook to see if it would jumpstart the game on my phone and it worked.",
            "Alot if times I'm on a level for weeks. It's due to the game itself not giving me the colors I need. I could have 7 balls left and only need one color to win, and it never gives it to me, only weeks later. That's my only problem with the game. Other wise I spend alot of free time playing. Love this game!!!!",
            "I'm very disappointed in the game makers, I have no problem with the game myself but my partner who suffers from mental health uses this game as an outlet to help her through her day. However she cannot currently play her game as her new phone screen is too narrow, she submitted a review here ages ago but as yet the makers seem more bothered about Halloween themes.. I can see that many other players across the globe are having the same issue.. btw your link is not copyable"

            "It do help a bit while trying to manage your Instagram account but it's quite limited on what you can do. I can't export my whitelist to use it with a script or another app. And the automated unfollow method is dumb. We don't have a way to customize how it is going to work. There's no way you can report problems or contact the developer inside the app, which is a bummer. We can't sync the list of people that unfollow the profile you tracking. There's room to improve this app.",
            "Much better than the original. I switched from this to a professional paid software for a few years. But since the changes insta made I got rid of the automation. I like that it doesn't scrape everything everytime you go on the app. And that you can now do it manually. Tip 1: Use 4g/5g Tip 2: Do it manually(click image and unfollow inside insta app) Tip 3: Dont do too many at once. Maybe 20 max and spread it over the day Tip4: Dont scan too many times. Try to restrict this to 1 or two at most.",
            "Absolutely very helpful app. I was doing these tasks through code but then came across it . Giving one star less because the \"Auto\" functionality stops working after one or two uses and I think that is because Instagram blocks those actions. Will give 5 stars on the day developers are able to disguise Instagram 😉. UI can be improved but I can live with it. Thanks developers.",
            "TURN OFF WIFI AND IT'LL WORK. All you have to do is turn off Wi-Fi and it will work perfectly. No complaints once I figured this out. I was having the same problems as all of you until I forgot to turn my Wi-Fi back on today and all of a sudden I was able to unfollow 50 at a time over and over. You have to wait 8 minutes once you reach 200 unfollowers otherwise Instagram will flag you as a bot but after 8 minutes you could go ahead and do it again.",
            "I give it 5 star because According to me, this is the best app i have seen for our insta id, some times it gets bugs but after some time it is again in work,it gives us features like Followers, Unfollowers of your id, and many mores, you can log in 1 or more id's at same time, but i request to the developers to remove the bugs from the app, because it's irritating and One of the best feature of this app is - No Adds😍"

            "Why there is no glitch and ads",
            "So when I play the multiplayer game, the aponent's bar will run out and I will still have life but the game will continue on, until I end up losing!!??? Very frustrating, set up so that I cannot win, even when I do. I have contacted you through email more than once but I get no answer and the problem continues. It is no fun to play when it's not played fair. Fix the problem for other players. As for me, I'm done playing because it's not set up to be played on an even and fair playing field.",
            "A decent game. If you've played a lot of mobile games, it meets all the expectations. Energy dependent gameplay, coin collecting, upgrading equipment, pay to win optio, ads to watch for energy and coins. Quick missions are too random. At least one slot should be given to weapons. I don't know how you can complete missions with just consumables. It's worse if you are just starting out and barely upgraded your equipment. An average game but nothing special.",
            "Hey guys... Im still waiting for the \"more levels coming soon\" it has been at least a year sine I finished episode 10! Game is quite good but you need quite a bit of coins to upgrade and purchase weapons. I actually got the double coins purchase and it was worth it, add to that the option of watching an ad for double coins again and you will be able to very quickly upgrade. you can beat the game without spending real money but it will take you a few tries. game is pretty good though."

            "Hello Yasmina. I chose to give the app another chance after a year went by. Nope. The basic features are not available for normal users. I tried it plenty of times. The app seems to have gotten worse. The users get bombarded with ads. I considered supporting the developers by becoming a VIP member but the app gets fishier after every minute I spend in it.",
            "Absolutely worst experience even after being VIP Profile. Joey from Customer Support has absolutely 0 understanding of customer queries. Please refer ticket number: #9760265 I asked in the query why I was not able to see users from another countries and my Profile verification was made mandatory for no reason at all after which I was not able to send any messages to anyone. Complete Idiot's on Customer Service.",

Lots of suspicious \"filler\" profiles of cute young girls with only one pic, limited info filled out, all listed as exactly the same distance from me. Every one of them, lol. . I guess no matter how big the company is, they are never \"above\" using tricky, shady, unscrupulous tactics . On a side note, all the profiles of overweight 37yos with two kids are definitely real...",
            "Used to be a a good option but now you cant even send a message without having to pay for coins. You have been taking features away from basic users so there's not much a basic user can do. I can see why there has been a big drop in new users.",
            "The free messaging is fake when I try to message it says you have to pay. If this wasn't the case I would give this app a five star rating."

            "You should also add an option where users can sell their unused equipments to add in their funds so that it won't turn into waste after upgrading. And also, it would be better if gold and other items' price cost lower. I bet, many would buy compared to expensive ones. I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",
            "I absolutely loved this game until today when there appears to be a major glitch with the game. No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

            "Fantastic app! It could use a few more settings so users can tweak everything, and it would be nice to be able to pause the video-in-photo playing for a good screenshot. This is really a great app so far. *** One important problem I see with this app is that when you touch a spot on the screen to lock the focus, there is no way to make it autofocus again. :/ I got this app for the video-in-photo feature combined with the semi-manual focus feature, but the autofocus doesn't quite work right.",
            "WOW .. just WOW !! After years of being frustrated with my Android device cameras, it's popped up in my play pass and I thought well let me give it a try. By FAR the clearest images & filters that you have just right as you're taking the picture without losing your shot. No more twisting and turning and getting cramps in my hands. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ★",
            "I like that it opens up instantly soon as clicked. No annoying whatevers to have to wait for. I will say its better than my fone camera. I have a galaxy flip 2. And I'm very disappointed with this camera. Was expecting better but probably would be better on a fine with better camera. Would like to see more filters, maybe add some fun Snapchat type effects but good job guys..",
            "I am happy with my device camera which is far better than this application with slow motion, time lapse, boomrange, short videos,image and video effects, low light sensor, sony imx sensor, phanaroma, HDR, timer, beauty mode, tilt shift, manual, image stablization, bokeh mode, potrait mode and many more settings available in my device camera i dont think this app has something special to keep this.",
            "It's okay. Trying my Powerdirector app for video editing and it will not accept any files that I use from this app. That was a deal breaker. I had to take each video file and convert it to the proper codec. There is no option in these settings to do that before transferring to a editor. Way too much time consuming just to get a decent video clip for editing. Not worth the time or effort."

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

This version is so old that there are a number of bugs that mean it's not suitable for new hardware. In the version I have, seeds and fuel never run out. Also, sometimes a section of your field turns a different colour and won't turn back. If GIANTS continue to offer this game for new devices on the app store, they need to clean it up and make it work correctly.",

            "This game Is fun no doubt, but it's also very pricey, and everyone is better than you, you have to play this game for 5 years just to get a decent player, and not to make it any worse but you take 2 shots and your out of stamina???? Not to mention you get blocked every time you shoot a 3 pointer",
            "Basketball battle is great, I love the power ups, custom players but when it comes down to the live events, most of the times i dont get my reward even if i come 1st and its really frustrating, overall I love the game. In the the next update can you make the score to win to like 15 or 20 because its to short😀 but still a very good game. Can you please change this ,when you block a dunk smetimes it still goes in. Thats reall bad and can you make the players you buy a bit cheaper than they are.",
            "Nice game! Looking forward for more updates and new players to select in 5 star up and some style and some tournament. I will give 5 star if the event everyday is change to something new format bcuz one score of opponent is game end. You can think better and upgrade the event! More event added pls",
            "Man to buy new players you neet to play ur whole life, players have level restriction. I have been playing for almost 6 months not regularly but still i have atleast 25 trophis i.e 3 championships=1 trophy and still i am not even lvl 50, cant buy good players. And I can't get my previous progress with my google play account, plz fix this",
            "So great and nice game it is I appreciate all of them who made this game it is good time pass game I have many games in my phone when I open my phone I open this game first, its amazing I could give 10stars to this game and yaa I like one more thing about this game we can play this game with our family also at 2 players.. I love this game 😊😊🥰"

Just plain crappy junk. Not worth it!",
            "So I am at this very moment doing an upgrade for this app. When I am doing that I am reading the reviews ( kinda backwards I know) Well every review I have read is saying \"run away from these problems \" how it is working terrible and even that it cant be uninstalled. I am very nervous and wondering. What did I get my self into?",
            "I'm giving five stars because on all my other phones I've had it works great. But, for some reason this phone the Samsung A01 it asks me to upgrade then tells me it's not compatible, why is this? It's a Samsung Galaxy phone.",
            "This is the phone from hell. Constant error messages so I can't open any unless manage to sneak it in . Now the sound has disappeared unless I put it on speaker phone. This phone was a waist on money just like all the Samsung products I have bought. I am in the hospital and need a phone.",
            "Phone never gets to 100%. Best is 89%. Very frustrating. Other than that it is a good phone. Does more than I ever use it for, though."

There are random ad traps designed for you child to click on them accidentally. This game would be great if there was a way to at least pay money and remove ALL ADSs. My daughter loves playing the drums with tom but they break every minute... 1 star for the money pit",

(more activities and games please! thank you so much) 😻🤍",
            "Ok, this game is interesting, BUT! I have some few complains........ When tom grows, he isn't cute at all! And when his emoji level is down, he simply gets angry at me at a certain age. When he was small he just was sad but now he is angry when his emoji is down! And everytime in space trails, or other games tom gets sleepy at just a 20 minutes! He gets tired to early and soo much notifications, I'm very busy. Pls fix this!!! Uh soo angry 😭😡😡👿👺😾",

Wanted a wireless number that I do not have. All I want to do is pay my bills. I go through some kind of B.S. every month. Between being on the phone and using the simple AT&T app I have been at this for well over an hour, and still have not paid my bill. Ridiculous!",
            "Update: Originally I could never pay my bill with the app. I always had to call in and explain the difficulties each time. The last 2 or 3 payments have been made so smoothly I would have to say this is now one of the better apps I use. Thanks for fixing all of the issues I have noticed. Original post: This app is absolutely junk. I have so much difficulty with paying my bill each and every month. It just sits there spinning gaining no traction.",
            "I don't really know how good this works. It seems to be working a little bit better now, but it is still having problems remembering my USER ID AND PASSWORD. OH Well, I really hope that is just temporary. On one page it thinks it's 1 thing and on another page it thinks they are something else. For the third time, THIS APP OFFICIALLY STILL WON'T LET ME SIGN IN!😠😠😡😤 OTHER than that I guess it's ok.",
            "Its been 2 months that me and my wife switched from Verizon to ATT, and yet have been able to get login into an online account. We have spent many hours trying to get this resolved with att and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue, still to this day nothing has been done. The customer service is very unprofessional, and possibly undertrained. I've never had such issues with Verizon and Verizon service is always top notch. Will be back with Verizon after our two years are up.",
            "This app is garbage. You would think AT&T would be sure the app was functioning properly so people could spend money with them, open new accounts, etc., But instead this app literally never works right. It always crashes. It's just garbage. Which reflects AT&T well because none of their stuff ever works. Their service is garbage. And their CUSTOMER SERVICE is even worse. This is so sub par. Verizon is far superior in every way. Unfortunately I live in the woods and AT&T is only one that works"

I wanted to just try it again and it absolutely must be so graphic and sound intensive that it totally lags out on my moto z4. There is no way this app should require this many resources, I play very graphic intensive FPS game and I have no lag with them. Something is very wrong here. I'll just stick with playing my piano, it is a nice idea if it would work.",

As I improved, the more fun it was to play. I love hearing new music and I especially enjoy learning how to play them. This would be especially fun on a road trip where you could pass your phone or tablet around the car for everyone to try.",
            "Love this app but the updates have cause the game to really struggle on several note heavy stages. Seems like it's streaming the notes instead of downloading them like before which causes it to chug along and miss note presses. Tried on other devices and it's definitely a software issue.",

Seemingly authentic feel. Option to use or turn off guidelines. There isn't a single thing I can find wrong about this game. By far the best of all the billiards game I've tried. I've uninstalled all the other ones. This one's a keeper.",
            "This game is just ,wow ,wow Awesome this game,app came to the change. The graphics are just awesome its like the game is in 3D .Its like your in the game its so real so cool . And its like you are really playing pool and the best part isthat the game is not even aditive l really think its for all ages. The game is really interesting yaa thats all .The graphics kind of look like the hair of this unikorn🦄 .Pool Billiards is cool mainl,when you are playing to win. Yaa",
            "Poorly done. Just aim and shoot. Asks automatic 5 stars rating .. actually enforces .. uninstalled. Bugs like setting cue ball near the rail. Horrible implementation. Just like 80's magazines selling games with non-existing graphics. There is no cue control. No angles. Nada. Poor clickbait app.",
            "It SUCKS!!! Seems when your beating the computer or whoever you playing, the games seems to take over and start moving the cue ball over the table without anyone scratching. Its a damn Hoax uninstalling. Did this at least 5 times.",
            "If I could give a negative star I would. I played a great game and then when it came to the eight ball the game shot by itself causing me to hit the other players ball then knocking the 8ball in. I'm deleting the app and never playing again. And I advise anyone else not to even waste their time"

            "Excellent game that makes your brain think, but not to the point where it is frustrating. To those complaining about the ads. either turn off your internet/data, or support the developers by purchasing their ad. free offer.",
            "To play without ads, turn off your wifi and data; That being said, I would have given it a 5 as I used to REALLY enjoy this game, but as of today I do not. For whatever reason, it now removes and rearranges the tubes once you have filled a color. I do NOT like this, it is havoc on my brain/eyesight.",
            "Great game. Loads of ads, so you'll need to pay to get rid of them. It is worth the free, however, you still have to watch ads when you get enough percentage to unlock the test tubes. Hence my lower star rating. Surely you should be able to unlock without watching adds when you've paid for no adds? Big downside!",
            "Really nicely done. You'll usually have difficult levels interspaced with a few easy ones, so every time you pick it up you find the game challenging and rewarding, great flow. The sound effects are perfect too. Given the time it often takes to complete a level I don't find the ads too obtrusive either.",
            "Too much irritating by ads, why don't you stop ads displaying on my screen. While I play this game to stop my mobile data button, is it ok for you. Try to imporve your game, I can't suggest to play this game to anyone of my friends & relatives. If in case iam going to suggest this game and they are all facing same problem like what Iam facing problem with this game. They all beàt me very hard. Because this is too much irritating by ads playing between game to game. Can check it or not tell me."

But now after the update on the 16th two of my cameras stopped working again. What's going on?",

Otherwise this app and product (camera) is to easy to use",
            "Im using network segment15(255.254.0.0) instead of 24,thats why even if we were in the same network with the same gateway, theres always a connecting issue. It would be better if this supports LAN storage as it is more secured and lower cost....I hope theres an update with facial recognition or maybe an update with 3D camera. Unstable playing over LAN when connected to wifi. Do you have a cam version with ethernet port capability? I think it would be better when playing livestream and replay....",
            "This camera works well. Very good clear picture, and has different ways the camera will connect. Alarm and voice works well. In the settings you can turn off voice, and disarm alarm, which are nice features. 4 stars because it needs an option for split screen view, at the top on right side by the X like most apps maybe in the future though . So far this is a good security camera with lighting as well.",
            "Application will not start at all after the update. Only white screen EDIT: I managed to start application by completely removing it and installing it again. Then I got notified to update camera firmware. I did. Camera said that update was finished and it seams that everything went fine (internet and power were stable). Now I cannot connect to camera at all. In application it says \"connecting\" forever on the panel where video should be shown."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "The arcade game is very challenging. Takes a lot of concentration, which I like. I have changed from five stars to 4 due to the \"new game\" needs to be moved. I have accidentally hit that more than once and I was on level 65 and had to go all the way back to level 1 again. PLEASE MOVE IT WHERE THE OTHER OPTIONS ARE. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU!",
            "This app cheats badly,. Puzzle level 65 is worst, balls sometimes suspended in mid air attached to nothing and this always happens when a third ball is on its way to a target of two other balls the same colour. It would be much better if the ball aim was accurate. If you don't mind games that cheat against you then this is an ok time passer. Also, there should be a pause button for any interruptions.",
            "This is not a game. I've played this game for years and progressed through the levels, but the current version won't allow the player to win/pass certain levels. It just shuts you down by disallowing placement, never providing a certain color bubble, etc. It just becomes a frustrating experience and is no longer a \"game\". Too bad, it used to be fun.",
            "Favorite ball shooter ever. I had to sort through all the wannabes to find this game again. Tried some others but none are as satisfying. It's a challenge and it's straight forward. You don't run out of lives, you don't have to buy balls, there aren't all these extra elements. It's ALL about where you shoot the ball.",
            "It's good and addictive but you can't start the game over from the beginning once you get to a level you can't pass. It's infuriating being stuck on an advanced level. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game but it still remembers my last level. I just want to start from the beginning"

            "My experience with this app was very bad. The cake was not at all good, both in presentation and taste. Also the note delivered was hand written, it should be in printed form and even I select the option to not show my name, still they wrote my name. Its been more than 7 days when I raised complaint and still they haven't done anything. I will never order from FNP again.",
            "Till now its best .... Thankyou so much for reaching us to the best !!! Just there is a problem while making a payment!! Please look at the payment process it does get completed on the spot instead of fetching any link in mesaages or emails, or it just works like that !! Thankyou 😊 Hello there, Its an humble request can you please open one of your frenchiese here in dhule maharashtra, i hope you'll consider my opinion ❤",
            "This is an excellent app to deliver gift items to any place at any item. But I dont like the way tickets are addressed. Generally you should close a ticket when the whole issue is addressed. I just see someone just replying to it and it is closed automatically. And there are no app notifications to let us know there has been a reply in the ticket we raised nor for its closure. Though the motive is to provide a better service, this is irritating.",
            "This is one of the best app ever if want to surprise your near and dear one..I was out of town and wanted to make my husband's birthday very special, but i thought without me how it would be possible, but fnp made it memorable. They gave the Beautiful and tasty cake. It was awesome, my husband was very happy i recommend to go for fnp everytime. I missed to add they delivered it before time. Thank u fnp..keep growing 👍",
            "Pathetic app and service. Usually product cost is high and we understand it is for service. But the service is really very very very bad no use of paying high price then usual. FnP has spoiled my special day by informing that service can't be provided before 2 hrs of that occasion whereas I did a advance booking almost 4 to 5 days before. Not gonna recommend this app for its services neither I'll be using it anymore."

            "This game is filled with ads every few seconds, which is understandable to a point, it's free, but those ads should be appropriate for the target audience of the game. Multiple ads have come up that advertise the keto diet and explain that if you don't go on it your partner will hate you, or that your appearance is the only thing that matters. Others advertise animated characters and zoom in inappropriately on their crotch. This is unacceptable for a children's game!",
            "Angela is adorable! She has cute fashion sense and I've always thought this game is full of good vibes. The mini games are also pretty fun! Just a heads up, there's a lot of ads in this game, but I'm glad the more inappropriate ones don't appear anymore for the sake of its intended audience. To the devs: Minor note as if writing this, her hair in her Halloween outfit sometimes glitches in her sleep.",
            "Great but there's a few glitches. Like the puzzle game. Blocks get stuck at the top half of the screen and you can't move them. The sky high game - you can't get higher that 10 points even if you got all perfects/ even if you watched an ad to keep going. Makeup that you (in game) buy gets removed if you dance with the blue stars and earn temporary makeup. After a day, Once the temporary makeup ends, the other makeup gets removed even if you didn't use the temporary makeup. Pls fix ♥️",
            "This game is very good,relaxable,enjoyable and many good things about this game I love this game so much ,,,but Can you please fix the bugs. When l go to store to buy sticker for watch ad (data off) and when l turn on the data it will show that 20 diamonds. I RECOMMOND THE INSTALLERS THAT PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS FOR ENJOY, EXICTMENT, RELAX AND FEEL GOOD",
            "This game is very good there is one problem reason for 4 stars. Every time I went out and went back in then it kept on saying go to the previous game or start a new game then every time I went to the previous game it made me start everything overeverything like the sleeping and they're eating and applying and the dancing went to 0%"

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",

I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",

Also add the reply function and the option to unsend messages. Lastly, sending a file is such a good feature of the app that also should be added to the main app, but please improve it by retaining the actual file name of the files we send instead of changing it to randomly generated name and numbers. Thank you.",

            "You really need to put in less instrumental songs and more songs with words. Most of these songs are like fast paced lullaby songs. Need more songs that have a good beat, are English, and have words in the songs. Also a few more songs that start off a bit slower for beginners.",
            "This game is just horrible. It's slow, it's lags, the adds are constant, I had to play airplane mode and it still lagged. The music gets drowned out by the vibrations and the app overall is just ugly. I'm not sure what happened here but it's honestly not worth the time and energy to even download.",
            "*sigh* I have to take a quick break from this game because it's so addictive! But the only problem I have is about the amount of ads shown literally whenever you do ANYTHING! It's getting irritating. Please do something to shorten the amount of ads. Please please please! I love this game but the ads make me want to delete it. :-) thank you for taking my comment into consideration.",
            "This game is amazing but, It missed out on a star as the songs are mostly covers and not the original song and I don't like it as (not to be rude) I sometimes cant hear the singers or they are singing the wrong lyrics. Other that that, this is a very good game :)",
            "I'll give you two stars for only one reason.Just one , ADS!!!!.I mean like everything is literally based on ads , If you want to try out a new song ,ADS.When you finish the song ,ADS.When you hit the wrong key , ADS when you loose ADS.LIKE SERIOUSLY THOUGH,Try to find a way to minimize the ads .Apart from that everything else is good.I was so irritated by those ads I had to uninstall the app just to have a wonderful day. Try and consider myrequest infact everyone is telling the same thing 😓😥"

            "This app works great. My phone has a call block function, but, as soon as you delete the call history, it lets the calls through again, and I got tired of that real fast. This app keeps blocking unwanted calls, even if I delete my call history, and it's easy to block new spam calls. I would recommend this app to a friend, or family, that wants to block spam calls.",
            "Works perfectly. I moved from one state to another, and I'm constantly spammed with calls coming from my previous area code. I was able to block the entire area code (just make sure to include the country code), and it blocked 10 calls in one afternoon. It also logs the blocked numbers, which was helpful because I forgot to whitelist someone from my home state, saw that she called, and whitelisted her. I honestly cannot recommend this app enough. It feels like I finally have some control.",
            "It's so annoying to get telemarketers calling 20 times a day. This app takes care of that! I had used this app a few years ago, and with an OS update it went all wonky, blocking calls from my contacts and allowing spam calls. They have fixed that problem. The only problem I have with this app is it still allows the unwanted calls to come through; however, it does not ring, so you're not disturbed.",
            "Yes I like this app, profoundly so. Thank you for providing this excellent service. The app it self is easy to use and navigate, everything is explained in a clear and concise manner. I do work nights only, and got tired of being disturbed repeatedly by spam/scam/robo calls. I do sincerely believe those people who cause or make those calls need to find real jobs that provide an actual service to society. I am grateful, now I can rest more than 4-5 hours a day. So thanks.",
            "The app works great. Since I've installed it, I haven't had to deal with a single spam call. Now when the phone rings, I know it's one of my contacts rather than spam. The SMS part is a little underdeveloped, but that's a minor quibble and it doesn't have to be used anyway. Overall, terrific app."

Also you have not expanded the levels, what gives? In others words where's the updates and will Ivy reply to me? Obviously I'm not important enough to reply back to and this team of people don't seem to care enough about this game to update it. 😡",

If you are looking to just kill some time then this game should fit in quite nicely but if you are not looking to spend on the game then you'll face a ton of ads which will annoy you eventually. The in-app purchase deals are not so nice by the way.",

Now the game is way too colourful, it looks like it was made for 7 year olds now. Upgrades shop sucks ads are just too much and what on earth did you do with endless mode. This game was epic, now it just sucks.",

This is not an issue with any random valet for his connectivity issues. The problem persists for all orders. Valet doesn't move at all on the map at times. The issue persists even after latest update. 2) Even after the order is delivered, at the bottom of the main screen, it is displayed as Food is being prepared.",
            "Great app. Lots of filters for ease of use. New update for one star on 30/10/2020. Pathetic approach. I ordered the food. Restaurant was ready with food, but no rider was allocated for an hour. Finally when I contacted customer care, they said sorry and added a credit amount for their mistake. I paid for service, not to get the credit. Finally, the restaurant itself arranged their own driver and sent the food and was never sent by Zomato. Regret to be a Zomato Pro member.",
            "The new UI revamp is refreshing. The notifications and chats are handled well. The payment page fragment design can be improved. One can easily miss the promo section, if its not intentional. I would expect orders to be shown by default than favourites in the orders tab. The order tracking banner is well designed as well. Kudos to the designer.",
            "Unfortunately with the recent changes in benefits of using this app, i stopped using it and membership fees were paid for nothing. Will never use it again simply not worth it. This is what happens when you make people pay for certain benefits of using the app and choose to wipe it all out but reyai the paid by members money.",
            "When I started out new, it was an excellent app for food delivery. But now there are issues happening most of the time I want to order. The menu is not visible to me and it is showing that I can order. Half the time I want to order there is some kind of issue going on like not delivering to my location or switched off ordering but actually it is showing that I can order now. What the hell is wrong with Zomato?"

Why is that? But apart from that, nothing is wrong with the app. Thank you!",
            "Although, this is the excellent app lock 🔐, I never got this much of functions in any other app lock, but In my phone 📱 it was always forced stopped/stop running, and I have to restart the application, this is the problem faced by me while using this application. Please try to fix it, if you can as fast as possible. Thanks!",
            "Although it works perfectly on my single screen Samsung Note 10 Lite, sadly it does not work on my dual screen LG G8X. If an app is started from the dual screen, in the main screen it is asking for finger print, while it is already open in the dual screen, and can be used without fingerprint. I think you should look into this matter.",
            "This is a really good app but when I tap on recent apps the messages on the previous apps that I was using are still visible. If someone opens my recent apps that person can read those messages. You guys should hide the app content that is shown in the \"recent apps\". At least for those apps in which a person can have privacy problems (Gmail, Instagram, WhatsApp)",
            "the app worked well on my previous phone with android 9.0, but now on my new android 10.0 phone the lockscreen takes far too long to appear after selecting an app. it literally waits for the app to load and then shows the lockscreen a split second after the loading screen ends. which is enough time for someone to see what you're trying to hide. someone could potentially screenshot the app in that split second. Please fix this."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",
            "Perfect Mix of Mobile Security & Antivirus Combo For Galaxy Note 4 Running On Android 6.0.1 Everything seems to run well with no issues. I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "It was fine at first, but then all my credit dissapeared. I've checked my transaction and the only thing I bought was Rp.10 and I still had Rp.9.990 left. But they are all gone. I also checked my last transaction and it said something wierd about a transaction of 0.72KB for Rp.4320 which I didn't do and what even was it? Please explain and fix it.",
            "Before new update, it works very well. But after updating, the app didn't work as like as before. It Always say \"lost connection\" or something, and when i press the reload button, still didn't work. Im even try reinstall the app but still got the same problem. I hope there's new update to fix those bug. It's really annoying honestly.",
            "To open this application is needed the high level of patiece. This app is so slow, and the package is useless, you make a package to access for spesific application, then when we open another application it takes my regular credit. My credit never lasted more than a week, and when I wannna use my credit, I saw it's already 0. There is nothing that I can be proud of this provider."

In this game everything is fine except for the ads. I also want to highlight that I also want there real voice. Fix it pls. Other than that there is no problems with the game. And as this is a very relaxing game I would like to tell you all who can download, to download this asap, so that the whole world will be fully relaxing.",
            "I like this app and the songs are really many, but i have a few suggestions. First of all it would be better if they put their real singing voice for the artists in the songs.The second one, there are some missing songs i like it would be an horner to add a little more songs. So that's my suggestions. Now the thing i like (not the ONLY thing) is that the one that says we can play our own songs. I really like that we can play different song. But other than those suggestion, the game is great!",
            "Love this app!!! The graphics are pretty good, but the only reason why I gave this app four stars is because that I just don't really like watching ads. But don't worry Tiles Hop, I still haven't deleted it yet! The thing about the adds is 1, there quite boring to look at, number 2, ads aren't really pleasent for me to hear either. And finally, number 3, I don't like any types of ads no matter what. So can you PLEASE fix this? I really want to take a break from ads for now.",
            "This is the first music game I love, better than cooler hop 3D and I just downloaded it. I can now see what 100 million people download it. The graphics a excellent, the controls are almost perfect and the gameplay is also almost perfect. I can bear the ads and I love it! I can see that it was right to choose this game and I think I'm going to enjoy it.😊😁 Ughhh! I hate how the voices get higher after you win a level and play it again. I don't like ma high pitches. Please fix this it🙏🏽",
            "Its so much fun the fact of the game its like making a song but a game and it match the beat of the song. ITS worth it buying it now! But here the thing there is some missing song that I would like butt in the future the might fix that, but still worth buying it!"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."
