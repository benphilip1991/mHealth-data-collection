            "Best Way strategy game I would give it 5 stars, if not for this few things I wish the developer would add very soon 1. A way to vote out a clan leader: some leaders can't access their game accounts anymore. So they begin afresh, but resuming their leadership role becomes impossible, so they and clan members are force to abandoned clan cos of inactive leader. Please make it easier to change leaderships in clans to save clans 2. Please include clan battles and gold sharing. Thanks",
            "I like the game but if you could just buy the game and pay for updates i think i would spend money. The way its set up its like a never ending nickle and diming. And whoever pays gets more advantages which isnt really strategic so much as pay to win. Also, i feel like im playing a computer many times even when it says im playing wifth or against another person... i dont know. Also, it doesnt take much strategy for someone to sit in their base and develop a nuke (sPaCe StRiKe) and just blow U up",
            "Great game once you get to level 7 where skirmishes are avaliable this game is a real rts but its not for a casual player as game play is slow do you need time to invest. This is a pay to win and things are expensive but you can also invest time and get the things another (research) production queue would be great devs also but please don't miss out on this game its very good once you get into it. Thanks",
            "Game doesn't load after its open, I am done waiting and unsitalling it right now. I used to love this game a lot but now this issue has killed the vibe, i would appreciate the developer team to fix it as soon as possible. Really want to play it again Just because of this issue i have given it 1 star",
            "The game is good and the graphics also.. but for now i just give a 4 star.. i wish that you can fix a minor problem that i encounter like sometimes the troops dont know where to go when i ordered them.. they just walking to somewhere dead end area."

As a parent including words and pictures on the spot by any means, that is, from our own photo gallery, from internet, or a photo taken there and then is also very essential. I would recommend Avaz to anyone who is in need to communicate in an alternative way other than speech or sign language, be it for children and adults alike. Thankyou.",

Avaz offers a subscription plan that others do not. and come aac awareness month keep your eye our for special promotions. the Avaz developers do this for families not self.",

Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

            "2 stars for easy to use app and changes were updated for scratched horses. I know it's gambling but with featured track purchase on a 11 race card... 33 horses in W, P, S got 3 right, 1 super that cost $12 paid $6.60 and 1 exacta that barely paid for itself. Nothing else hit. That's less than 10% on a FEATURED track!!! There's free stuff out there much, much more accurate. Like I said, it's gambling, not asking for refund but this was absurd, Got me once, won't happen again.",
            "I downloaded this a while ago, went in to look how to use it, I didn't see the free picks, I just played 4 races online, im up 1000 this app is great love it, i want to buy a package but always have an error, i will continue to use this, they lost 2 races straight but i won on every other race i bet on, thank u so much to the people who are in charge of this app and reach out to me i want to get a package from u i want to continue to make $$$.",
            "Can't get the race card easily 🤣 too much trouble looking for the button for the racecard that sucks the phone to oblivion. No way to bet moola not good!!! Can't win with out betting!!! Go trying winning with out betting. Money lost by using the application for gambling and the fun is gone. Let me bet. Is all I'm not betting the farm I'm doing well good evening so far ☺️ I cashed out $10.10 winnings already I'm trying for the trifecta and more Wild betting",

            "If google would fix the audio issues, this so would be great, but if the volume level is going to continue to be a crappy mystery as to what level it'll be when I plug into my truck, then the app gets 2 stars. 95% of the time when I plug in the sound is instantly a quarter of my Bluetooth volume. As it is though, I'd rather do without it than deal with the headache. To the 'developer' that linked the forum, you should check it yourself, this has been posted for years and still not fixed",
            "Great when it works, lately it's been struggling to connect and randomly just disconnects. At first I thought it was my cable/ charger port, but now realize it's actually the app. When first connecting, it's been pulling up and them immediately closes out, or it'll show the icon on the screen and play the music, but it'll never open up. I have to keep unplugging and replugging to get it going. After a few tries it works.",
            "10/28/20 Still not very helpful. Should be so much easier, truly. It's like it's all there but not easy or even polished looking. None of the normal controls work to make selections, so it's all touchscreen. This is not safe, especially since one must often go back and forth between apps since only one app's info can be displayed at a time. The phone itself does a much better job, also because one can have that in a holder within closer reach. Also, assistant is hit or miss.",
            "Ok, I love the interface and how easy it is to use. I have an older car, so I don't have a screen in my dash. This makes it easy to control my music, use GPS, and the other things I choose to see. Plus using it with Google Assistant makes it 100% hands free. HOWEVER It turns on at weird times, I can't get it to only come on when it syncs with my car bluetooth, so I've had to take it completely manual to connect. Which would be fine if it didn't STILL activate for no reason. Grrr.",
            "It doesn't even work anymore. I put in a destination, it routes it, but then the blue dot that represents me stays at the starting point of my travel. The map never progresses past the starting point. GPS is enabled on my phone and the location permission is enabled in settings. I'm angry. I'm on a Pixel 2 running Android 11. My car is a 2016 Subaru Legacy."

MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \r\nThe verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\r\nMITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. MITA exercises can be used by children with language delay, ASD, PDD, intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), Down syndrome, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as a supplement to conventional speech therapy.\r\n\r\nMITA is developed by Dr. A.

To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered. I have to change a level back manually at each session, because I am sure that my child does not remember a name of an object, but got the program algoryth using visual clues.",

Ps: please add a seperate button to start using the wide angle lens, it is soo frustrating when the camera switches to wide angle while zooming out. Edit: no response to the email, congrats amazing customer service.",
            "I have to say that the moto g9 has some serious camera issues and u guys have to resolve it soon. The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",
            "Just bought the Moto g 5G plus however the app crashes every time when I zoom out the rear camera with ultra-wide and it asks me to restart the camera......is it the problem with the app or the new phone which just opened today",
            "What's the use of hardware if your are not having a perfect optimised software ? Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos. All previous generation moto camera where doing a great job than this why this you have done for motorola fusion plus please rectify asap..."

Thanks for your efforts dev."

            "I like the simple gameplay, and collecting my favorite wrestlers. But when it comes to getting more and making them stronger, unless you're rich, it's going to take a long time. The rewards for events suck, everything is expensive, Scopely HATES giving away free stuff, the prizes are always the minimum amount awarded, and often what you DON'T need. I started when it was new and rewarded well, now it's an exercise in disappointment. Unless you're a fan, don't bother, even then be cautious. 😡",
            "If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I've been playing for a few years now so, im invested. But, if you're reading this and you havent installed yet...dont. Scopely took a very entertaining game and turned into a giant cash grab. Unless you're prepared to open up your wallet and just give them everything in it you have 0 chance to be even competitive anymore. Screw getting ahead unless you fork over hundreds of $ forget about even seeing the same level as the average player.",
            "STAY AWAY!!!! unless you enjoy being screwed over time and time again, then go ahead and download and play it. Been playing pretty much since the game launched, there are toooo many bugs that they refuse to fix, they will rollback rewards as they see fit, most events will launch with issues and be taken down to be \"investigated\".... just not worth it",
            "The overall user experience is a nightmare. While there are some fun aspects to the game in terms of roster building and movesets, nothing comes close to the way the player is treated like absolute garbage by this company. On a weekly if not daily basis, there are messed up rewards that are shrugged off with the poorest possible apology and no recompense. If you are thinking about trying this game, don't.",
            "Good game... if you are one who needs to be the best on free cellphone games you're going to spend... key word (free) just keep it simple and enjoy. If you want to make developers rich then spend. It's a choice, they are not holding you hostage. That goes for any free cellphone game people download and complain about spending. WWE Champions is ... AWESOME!"

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",
            "Wow. My old phone is logged in using my Facebook and my Google account. I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "Great game, but two things you could improve: 1. When you leave the app for even a second, the app restarts. This can be annoying when I want to check something like my texts. 2. Could there be a quick place option? I hate manually placing the same building, for example stuff like energy sources and money sources. It would be convenient to place large amount fo buildings at once. Sincerely, a Player.",
            "Great game, when it loads. Nothing wrong on my end for connection, had it tested. Don't bother spending any money or investing in contests, it won't load on the last day. Sick of playing a game with blank squares with money symbols on them. Can't collect built goods in factories when it doesn't load etc. What a waste of time and money. Only game with no actual fighting or war against someone else, only reason it gets any stars. No war! Thank you.",
            "Absolutely loved this game. This game has a lot of different buildings to choose from. The one problem being, there isn't an option to store the buildings, you either have to move them to a different place or sell it and buy it again and place it where you want to. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves city construction games.",

Update October 28: Now you can't even upload pics because it's says the permissions are incorrect, even though they are correct. How useful is a dating app that won't let you upload pics?",

If you want to do a subscription service, just do a subscription service. Don't tell people it's free when it's not. Even the worst freemium apps give you some time, but this app hits you with a paywall within 30 mins of signing up. The other dating apps are bad, but this is the worst of the lot.",

It takes now takes an inordinate amount of time to go from Alerts to Carousel, and from writing a message back to a picture. Writing a message does not show up in a timely manner. More errors exist but you get the idea. Do yourselves a favor, reissue the previous version!",
            "I have just paid £25 for a months subscription which is supposed to include unlimited messages but other than \"liking\" someone's profile I can't send any written messages. Also just found out the \"liking\" is also limited to a certain number a day & everything I try to do I am hit with a upgrade message wanting more money from me.

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

I've rebooted my phone, I've cleared my cache, I've turned off my VPN, I've cleared my junk files and my residual files with Norton Clean, and I've deleted the game and reloaded it, NOTHING WORKS.",
            "At first it was okay, $4.99 packs then $19.99 packs to help you advance, now mostly everything is $100 packs. I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. 👎",
            "Have played this game for a number of years getting very discouraged game will load for a day then close spontaneously during the loading process. They tell me its my phone but when others have the same issue. I'm seeing they only want money not fix the issues I'm down grading my stars to a 2 because of technical issues without fixes and it has evolved to a pay to play, pay to win game.",
            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",

Wanted a wireless number that I do not have. All I want to do is pay my bills. I go through some kind of B.S. every month. Between being on the phone and using the simple AT&T app I have been at this for well over an hour, and still have not paid my bill. Ridiculous!",
            "Update: Originally I could never pay my bill with the app. I always had to call in and explain the difficulties each time. The last 2 or 3 payments have been made so smoothly I would have to say this is now one of the better apps I use. Thanks for fixing all of the issues I have noticed. Original post: This app is absolutely junk. I have so much difficulty with paying my bill each and every month. It just sits there spinning gaining no traction.",
            "I don't really know how good this works. It seems to be working a little bit better now, but it is still having problems remembering my USER ID AND PASSWORD. OH Well, I really hope that is just temporary. On one page it thinks it's 1 thing and on another page it thinks they are something else. For the third time, THIS APP OFFICIALLY STILL WON'T LET ME SIGN IN!😠😠😡😤 OTHER than that I guess it's ok.",
            "Its been 2 months that me and my wife switched from Verizon to ATT, and yet have been able to get login into an online account. We have spent many hours trying to get this resolved with att and nobody seems to know how to fix the issue, still to this day nothing has been done. The customer service is very unprofessional, and possibly undertrained. I've never had such issues with Verizon and Verizon service is always top notch. Will be back with Verizon after our two years are up.",
            "This app is garbage. You would think AT&T would be sure the app was functioning properly so people could spend money with them, open new accounts, etc., But instead this app literally never works right. It always crashes. It's just garbage. Which reflects AT&T well because none of their stuff ever works. Their service is garbage. And their CUSTOMER SERVICE is even worse. This is so sub par. Verizon is far superior in every way. Unfortunately I live in the woods and AT&T is only one that works"

            "You'll hear this a lot. Game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ready to spend time to build your own little city you can do it without any diamonds, premium currency. Community is really helpful and good guild can make all the difference for one to stick with the game. It can be played on both mobile and browser, which is great because as city grows more time is needed to get it to run optimally.",
            "Unbalanced game play, players with much a bought stronger army can attack and plunder your items, super slow game play unless you're a pay player, I've been stuck for sometimes a week or more trying gain or trade for items to advance research, like I stated before if you throw real money at the game you can buy your way to the top a thousand times faster.",
            "Great game! If you're looking to \"beat\" a game, this isn't it. It's a slow roll, even slower if you don't purchase diamonds. The game play is good, and even at a slow pace, I'm entertained. I do have a suggestion though.. I'd like to be able to sell my buildings to other users, especially in my guild. If I could get forge points, goods, etc instead of auction $, the game would be even more interesting.",
            "Great game. However, a couple of suggestions 1. Please add a currently online/offline feature for players to see. Doesnt have to be seen by everyone, maybe just by friends and guild mates. 2. Please add in a last online feature for friends and guild mates to see. It is very hard to manage friends and guild list when you have no idea who are active and inactive players. 3. I find this game compared to most hardly gives out the in game currency(diamonds). Maybe try handing slightly more to players",
            "The game is so bugged I can't even start playing it right, but also I have it's a pay to play game . I've put my 10$ in this game to see if it's worth it, but honestly didn't even reach the point where I use them cause game won't load event or story and so on.... In short- no."

            "Excellent strategy movement game. Love it. I hope the developers read this. This game is fantastic. I have been playing it for quite some time. Always challenging never boring. I have downloaded other games but eventually uninstall them. I would rate this game 100 stars if I could.",
            "Game won't load. For the last 2-3 days it just hangs at the loading screen. At the same time, every time I try to load a page on the forums to get some advice on this it says \"file not found.\" Very disappointed as I am looking forward to the new Jerrika event to upgrade her again. Hard to contact tech support for help if the forums won't load and game won't load to let me do it from inside the app.",
            "I personally love this game. There are many diffrent unit types you can use for different team configurations. The possibility are almost endless. I also love that you can even recruit the enemies after a certain amount of fighting. Keep up the beautiful work.",
            "Well apparently I'm glad I didn't spend much money on this game to speed it up because I reached the end or at least what seems to be the end no new territory to open just the same mundane task now for 2 weeks. Game really had potential they still haven't fixed the first annoyance I reported reported.",
            "Nice little game to pass some time if you like rts type games. Gets a bit repetitive after a while. Go round in cycle of enemy being to hard to beat, you grind through some upgrades and then you suddenly beat them up easily until it became hard again repeat."

            "It is very fun but there are a few ways you could make the game better. The tutorial doesn't fully explain the game and I had a hard time figuring out how to play the game. The other way you can make the game better is by making it way easier to get bills. It is so hard to see all of these cool buildings in the shop that cost over 100 bills, I hardly get over a bill per week! Overall great game and it is very enjoyable.",
            "Takes you energy away if you have any when you level up. Example I have full energy with little xp to go before I level up. Then I get the xp to level up and then of course I get replenished energy but the energy I previously had is now gone. Energy with rollover capability would be great. Won't load friends either. When connected to facebook.",
            "The game itself is fun but it can get a bit repetitive at times. It also doesn't help that I can't do some of the mini games without the game itself crashing. The fact that some of the quests the town's people give you need dollars, which you either pay for or get extremely lucky to get from the prospecting minigame is a bit ridiculous.",
            "Update 10.15.20 The ap still crashes everything i try to go into the travel map thing.. ORIGINAL POST: Everything was working just fine until I switched phones. Now the ap crashes everything I try to download the new map. It is kind of frustrating because I was getting a lot of special items there. It made the game a little more fun.",
            "Game is nice but the clitches with not being able visit random towns or loading issues in friends to send and receive items is a real pain. The main reason though why I give it 3 🌟 is no way to long term save and move game to other devices, yet you want people to spend/invest money on a game they can easily lose and have to start over.. yeah I don't think so. You created a cute game.. adding a way to save and move between devices would get a lot more players playing your game long term."

Such a shame, as I've been using Kaspersky for years.",

For a whole year of subscription , it worked for few days on Android no matter what the device I use. They would reply that service is blocked in country while it works well on Windows all the time. Inexperienced support on mobile platform indeed.",

            "After reading a few of the reviews, I was nervous about trying to update. Happy to say I had absolutely NO problem. I used to have problems with many updates until I realized that my VPN was working too well, lol. (Even with \"safe\" sites. Nord can suck and I'm sorry I paid for 3 years in advance to get a good deal, or I'd have dumped it ages ago!) I never know what update is going to be stopped until it is, so if you're having trouble and have a VPN, try pausing it then try again.",
            "I'm always a little hesitant about updating this update after reading the reviews each time. It seems this update always seems to be tied to an update with Chrome. I have not had any issues with updating to this latest version. It is concerning, when there seems to be no feedback from the development team, who put out these updates. I hope someone is making them aware, of all the difficulties people are running into. Someone on their end should always monitor, after an update is available.",
            "It's awful and won't update, and because of, google chrome won't update!!! Fix it!!!!... C'mon!!! Stop giving us updates that don't work!! And because of it, google chrome will also not update!!! Said before, FIX IT!! or stop doing updates!! And yes, I've tried possible fixes that others have stated, still no! Herd we are again, one week later and this app won't update thus chrome won't update!! Fix ur crappy software or better stop the updates since they don't work anyway!",
            "nearly every weboage opened using this. When scrolling down, freezes and \"shakes\" on Android 11/ pixel 3xl Would love to delete it. But I've got years of saved content in it. Which for some reason known only to the Google gods. Does not save in the full version of chrome. Why? If I save a site in webview, aka bookmark it. Why doesn't it save in chrome too. Doing so would eliminate more of the infamous Google duplicity. We could eliminate this app or chrome. Which are technically the same",
            "I can't even download the most recent update, despite trying for several days. Reading the other recent reviews, I see that maybe it's good I've got an old version. Not good, cause it's still been buggy as hell, but, better (maybe)? What's going on? I use Android so this is affecting my other apps badly."

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them.

            "Edit: After contacting support my problem was solved. Thank you, McAfee I paid $30 as a special fee for samsung users only to find out that my subscription is a trial. Then I had to subsribe for $14/monthly to upgrade it to standard membership. Would have been cheaper and easier if I had just purchased total protection from the website. I hope unlimited number of device protection is still available",
            "I'd give them ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ because the app itself generally works fine! But... there is a failure that irritates me a lot..! The MS App lock feature..! I understand that applications should be locked, if I want them to be locked. But come on... it is a bit too pesky when you have to unlock them every single time, over and over, even if they were minimised. Please, add a feature/possibility to make some apps stay unlocked in session. Thank you.",
            "I've tried the rest so I can say with experience that this is the BEST mobile security app on Google Play Store! Unlike the other apps their malicious website detection is superb. It actually detects suspicious sites before your browser can visit them & blocks you from even going there. Competitor's apps only detected 50% of malicious sites. VPN feature needs improved security & IP masking because the Plus hefty fee increase doesn't justify it.",
            "Can't access mcafee account after updating app and had no help from developer, except got redirected back to the app after which my code was regiven, only to be told by the app it wasn't valid and I payed for a year to be able to use the full app service, no other option to renew for another year was given either, what is the developer doing, give me the run around, so I give 1 star until problem is resolved. Thanks.",
            "This app is amazing. I brought a new laptop and I got a McAfee Multi Device Subscription for up to 3 devices. I loved this app because of its simple interface, real-time scanning and anti-theft. I can also backup my contacts and media in it. It improves my machine performance and provided me high security.

            "Installed this app on my Android phone then paired successfully with my new ScanWatch without problems. Then the app completely stopped working. Now all I get is the error message that it's not responding. Reinstalled the app twice no difference. Had to install it on my Android tablet (not ideal) but at least it now works. Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",

It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

            "Ive read a lot of the other reviews and I don't have most of the problems that others describe. I did not expect much out of a free dating app though so it probably would've been hard to let me down... The \"match\" is terrible however. It wont show you who you've matched with, you have to hope that you happen to come across that person in the stack. Definitely a lot of bots but they are pretty easy to spot. Just be realistic about this and it'll be fine.",
            "So far so good no issues. The only problem I have is when I check out profiles a lot of the profiles haven't been logged into in months. If these women haven't logged in in months POF should send them an email saying if they're not going to log into their account at least on a weekly basis the profile should be deleted. I hate leaving a message then I go and look at the profile and it hasn't been logged in three or four months. POF delete old accounts that haven't been logged in.",
            "Does not distinguish between non monogamous and monogamous people. The search is fustrating as it's either 1 option at a time or all. ( 3 out of 4 not possible) It would be great if one could not see the same people over and over again, especially when not interested. At times, there appears to be a number of fake andor sex trade worker profiles. Other than that, this is the best free place to find your next ex. Happy fishing!",
            "What disappoints me about this app and others is 3 things. #1.There are so many fake profiles. Unless you know what to look for you get spammed easily. #2. the inability to be more specific with your choices of what your looking for. But #3 disappoints me the most. I have X number of people that like me. Yet I have to pay to be able to even see the people who actually like me? You are going against the very purpose of the app, just to make money. No wonder people are only here for hookups. 🙄",
            "After the latest updates seems they changed the format like where now you can't randomly choose a particular search area and for another instance you cannot unlike any of your ( likes) unless you're a paid member or unless only the person you had liked)pops up when you open the app,, then and only then you can choose to unlike the person or pay membership fee.."

            "thanks a lot for the free offline quality dictionary. The thesaurus has been far better and wider. So bad to see the learner's definitions are gone, but ok. The biggest matter with me on new version is that the ''tap to open'' function on words which has always been an awesome feature; has been extremely sensitive on touch and opens the words in a very extraordinary way and keeps distracting and bothering me all the time, the way I'm afraid touching the screen. It would be great if you fix this.",
            "Ive been loving this application coz it helps me alot on improving my vocabulary but now I don't know what happened 😔. Everytime I searched for a word it would say, \"sorry, not enough storage space. Please free up some space and retry\" though I still had enough space. I hope you'll fix this.",
            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",
            "It was so helpful for like me, who has a hobby of doing poems. I really enjoyed searching different words to fit to a certain topic of my work. So far there is no any trouble."

            "On 9/14 /2020 my phone stopped sending and receiving picture, audio, video, and group texts. The other line on my account did the same thing. Same time. We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "2 things happened to me. First is when I started playing on a different device, I came back to this one and all my stuff is gone, also when I purchased gold, the money went out but the gold never came, I've restarted the app, I even did the purchase 3 more times, all three times it withdrew but never gave me the gold, and now with all of my tanks and everything gone. I don't even want to play the game anymore",
            "This is the game where graphics and themes are awesome but same time their technical staff area is worst . They will keep sending you apologies ,give you some gold ,medals etc but they won't be able to restore your credits . Don't know if opponent use cheat codes or not . You will lost around 10k + credits , in a single match and that to the lower opponents . I have send them so many emails but till date they haven't resolved this issue .",
            "2 main issues, the new update doesn't allow the \"collect x amount of supply crates\" mission to work meaning I'm missing out on gold, and there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of silver earned from supply crates, making it much harder to level up tanks. Also, not sure what they mean by \"in game prices are now lower\" as I've seen no change in prices whatsoever. Tank upgrades still show the same price as before and buying anything for gold or money is still the same price.",
            "Great game so far easy to level up good game play great graphics events don't overwhelm you with the need to keep up pvp is optional it has plenty of options for strategy play challenging goals down side is it needs more content it has a place that said (coming soon) it has been some time and it has not been filled perhaps the devs need to install an alliance option in that spot with a leader board come on guys you have done this good keep going",
            "Great game, 1 problem I met though on my Huawey P9: Phone's display doesn't fit the entire game display, mostly the right side, therefore I cannot tap on the right arrow in \"depot - Blueprints\". I gwess this can be fixed by adding a display size option in settings wich I didn't see."

            "This app was good a couple years ago. But in the last couple years it has gotten worse and worse. It's always trying to sync and never does. This app needs to be redone. I like that I don't have to listen to every single message. I can visually see who the message is from. I like being able to erase certain messages without having to listen to them every time. This could be a great app if you would FIX the problems. Seems like everyone has the same issues. I've been with metro for about 10yrs.",
            "Keeps sending me messages that say the app is \"running\" and the app will not synchronize properly. VERY ANNOYING. Metropcs can't figure it out. Tried getting them to fix the problem three times but they don't know how to do it!!! Will probably have to uninstall the app, lose all of my archived messages and pic's and reinstall to see what happens. Also, NEVER set your permissions to ALL! Doing so will let messenger change your contact list, phone call information, distributes private info also!!",
            "I n hoping this update haz fixed all its snags, it wont sync, it leaves a tickertsape note acrossmy phobe staging it \" keeps trying to connect to uou ,but cant get thru\"! Now i tried getting on the app on my phone but after setting my new passcode per the apps request , and using my phones last 4 numbers like suggested by app! Then it wouldnt accept the phones numbers, i have to call my phone to get into my VM\"s so the app really is worthless! Lets jooe it has been fixed or im dropping it!",
            "I used to be able to delete old VM's, multiple at a time. I don't have to listen to them but I have to click on each one individually and delete it. Why can I no longer select more than one and delete messages I know I don't need to listen to?",
            "Always been great visual voicemail. Where can I locate the 2020 update version? I received a text message from Metro to get the update. Thank you. Susanne"

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "This freezes so often and the rewards, loots obtained in the battles are so less that it takes a lot longer to buy equipments. Plus the wait time for upgrading the tanks and its accessories is very long. The tanks are over-rated, thus, exorbitant. If there was any option of minus rating, I would rate it minus 10. The game developers should either improve it to meet the demands of its subscribers or the google play should completely ban boring games like this one.",
            "Fun game, however the only way to really advance is to buy the premium. At 8 bucks a week, get real. Same for buying packages, they want to get rich overnight. Need to learn that a million one dollar bills still makes a million dollars. Also, you don't always get credited with a kill. Needs to also be a way to communicate with others during battles. Enjoyed playing, but moving on.",
            "This was a great game for years, but with each upgrade it slowly got worse. Now it's a piggy bank for the privalaged.when it actually works. Whatever it gives you free , it takes from you in equal measure.the minute it crashes or freezes, I'm sorry but your game is unplayable. So if your a new player don't waste your time and effort. Because even if you pay to play it rarely works. They're not so quick to put the problem right for you,",
            "Decent battle game, but Devs need to improve battle matching. Many times the game matches you up with player ranks & tanks 2 sometimes 3 tiers above you -- difficult to compete with that. Also, the game has frequent sever/ connection issues as others have stated. The game selects the server automatically and does not show the option to change if it thinks one is better than another (should alow user to choose).",
            "While I enjoy the game play... I'm completely put off by the constant disconnect. Daily. Multiple times daily. Many times it just locks up and I have to quit the game. Guess what though... it still logs that you used energy to attempt your match. So, you lose that time. That's kind of a big deal for a game that uses three energy an entry. I've tried my home network and I have had the same disconnect issues as my mobile network."

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

            "From getting new gadgets, finding old original parts to fixing issues, the Carlcare app is the ultimate one-stop shop. I was able to register on the app, reserve a slot and speak with a customer care representative before heading to their office. My phone was fixed in no time, and as a bonus for being a first time user, I got a new charger for almost nothing. I love this app and will be using it much more often",
            "Worst aftercare app. The response is so slow. I keep waiting for hours sometimes days for proper response. The timings of the care centers are inaccurate most of the time and the inquiry option doesn't even open most of the time. Honestly needs a lot of work.",
            "I purchased Itel vision 1 plus. The phone is good looking but the major issue is that its mic and speaker is of very bad quality. Voice is very noisy when listening call and second party also complain that your voice is noisy. I will not recommend Itel vision 1 plus. Although it was economic and good looking.",
            "So far carlcare has been very useful... I brought an original Android charger for 300... So cheap... And they sell phones in a very affordable price with discount at times.... The best part is they exchange old phones for new ones at a very low price... It's mind blowing.... As of now it's been very useful",
            "Excellent..I never knew about this app..only till my warranted phone got fixed.. This is like a healthy insurance 😂😂😂 special advertisements on TV,RADIO,NEWS papers etc.has to be made... Many people don't know about it..though the live with the office in the same neighbourhood 😂😂😂"

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",

Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",

So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "Does exactly what is promised. I've been using it for 6 months and it still works fine. It's intuitive and highly practical. There's a slight learning curve when sharing lists across different phone types (apple/android/Google) but that may have been just me and my partner. Nonetheless I still use this app every time I go grocery shopping. Highly recommend it.",
            "So far it keeps the items I need in order. Now if it could just stop me from impulse buying it would be perfect. I guess I'll have to work on my self discipline. ET I have checked the others and this is definitely 5 stars. I had to play with it just like any other app/program that's new to you. I love it!!!. Get it now. It has saved me from dragging my daytimer and list into the store with me. My smartphone is with me all the time so my list is always with me. ET",
            "So Helpful! We do shopping once and week, and without fail, we always forget something or my kids text me to pick something up AS I'M DRIVING HOME! We have now all downloaded this app and we add to it as we remember things we need. Since it syncs and updates automatically, my kids can add to the list even if I'm already at the store. The app is very user friendly too. I love using it.",
            "We have been using Listonic for a while now. This is our second time buying the upgraded version. I highly recommend it because you can share lists. My husband and I linked a list called Grocery list so that either one can add to the list, and even send a last minute item if one is already at the store. We also created a separate Christmas list for each member of the family. Throughout the year, everyone updates their lists as they see things they like. It has made Christmas so much easier.",
            "This app, is great. It let's me update my list and add anything to it when I think about it, because I usually always have my phone near me, while a list might be at home, and i might forget to put what ever I thought of on the list when I got home. I can also make multiple list for several different stores. I can also make lists for fast food places. It let's you see a list of items as you are entering items, so yo I can pick from the list. It learns you item you enter so it is easier next time"

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "Sadly this app doesn't work with Wear OS. It doesn't let you register your account on the watch. Apparently, Google tried to fix this bug for a year and gave up. Now they say Wear OS is not supporting Google Workspace (aka G Suite) accounts which need a Device Policy. Why does this app then exist for Wear OS? How sad is that for a software company?",
            "Somehow this app does a good job of pissing me off. First, it doesn't sync. Second, it doesn't sync. Third, it doesn't sync. Fourth, it doesn't sync and fifth, did I already said it doesn't sync? And there's this annoying fact that it always uninstall itself. This app could be useful for my online classes but to be honest it is, well excuse me for the word but– trashy.",
            "What is this garbage. It doesn't sync, it doesn't work properly. Everytime i switch networks it stops the sync and now I can't attend my Google meets through my Gsuite account because this thing doesn't work at all. And then one day i rebooted my phone and it disappeared. I came back here to re-install and now it won't install. Such a beautiful piece of garbage. And btw...how can this app have a 4-star rating.",
            "since Android 10 update every few days after installing they sync stops. can't sync automatically, can't sync manually, can't sync over wifi, can't sync over mobile data!!! only re-installing the app is the only solution. fix this! this is a major major major inconvenience. I can't but use my University mail services so I'm stuck with this app either way. do something about it update August, 14, 2020: can't register my account at all. just can't.",
            "This app is worst, I tried to login in a work profile given by my university but this app redirecting me to log in again and again and now I can't able sign in and missed classes by this stupid app Google please think about users and update this app please fix the bugs this app made me hate Google apps I am not complaining about other apps but fix it this app is essential for college students,fix the problem"

Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",

The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

To make things worse, I can't always find the article I was reading again. Annoying. Update...Still happening. Still annoyed.",
            "it is a nice site- if you're into everything - I initially downloaded for my breaking neighborhood news - tried to adjust the notifications level to no avail - it resets itself for push, for local, for comments. it slowly started to take up my whole screen with updates on the same story, with nothing new to report on. I had to uninstall. :( updated 10/31 - app send emails only now :) it seems as though it has improved and I look forward to reading the articles now.",
            "I've been using News break for about a year now, and it's been informative and accurate in relating the news. I like this app mainly because if it's wide variety of topics and interest pieces. My news etc. is ALWAYS just a few inches from me. I don't have to go buy a newspaper for almost $2.00 everyday. I feel I get the news I need to keep me up to date between this app and watching Action news a couple times a day.",
            "The developer needs to work on this site!!! They do not respond back, or even care about issues. It freezes up and sometimes takes 30 minutes to as you to \"stop\"/\"wait\" or \"close out\" by that time you are other places. They load too many ads for the screens and ones that take over the whole screen where you can not close out of,you have to leave the app, and come back never to read the article you were trying. The ADs do not format to fit the page right. I need more space here to address issues"

Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",

The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",

I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

Why since its unlimited. Then you videos begin to wind. Then in the middle of a video, it leaves the site and goes back to the home page. Im going back aa soon as possible to verizon. The have the best service. My daughter passed, and our verizon account was in her name. She added me. Metro does not have good service.",
            "I've been with metro for about 2 1/2 years . I have only had two real complaints one was so unjust but eventually got corrected . The other continues today . I pay for unlimited talk and text and data . I'm sure I am not the only one with this problem , but every month when I pay my bill my phone is fast , accurate , and what is expected . Then after about a week I start experienceing major buffering and an otherwise frustrating time researching anything on the internet ! I've actually increased",
            "My main problem with this app is that you can't log in with Wi-Fi, it MUST be through data. So you can only imagine how annoying that was when having signal trouble or the one time the bill was paid a day late.. I get that it's for safety reasons, but glitches occur often enough already with this app, so it's double the pain. Handy on occasion but tends to fail out when you're in a pinch. Also whenever I try to call metro this app will pop open instead, not allowing me to make any of the calls.",
            "Your service is unacceptable . When I try to contact your company by calling from my phone through this app which is the only option I am given, my phone will not connect to you. And if by chance this service makes a connection and I finally get an agent the call is dropped everytime. My issue is never resolved. I am left in a worse position than I was when I started. Being frustrated and upset. I have tried several times with nothing. Not happy a happy customer.",
            "I just read a review about someone saying they have unlimited data it slows down. Depending on your plan your speed will slow down. You still get unlimited data but at a slower speed. You need to have the $60 a month plan to get unlimited 4g or 5g depe depending on the phone. Connect to wifi whenever possible to save your data"

            "Challenging game, entertaining. I laugh because I tilt my phone all the time trying to get my ball to roll where I need it to... which doesn't do anything. I like this game because if I ever get stuck there are hints. I would love the developer to help me sync the game (Google or Facebook) so when I change phones I can keep my levels.",
            "Only reason for 1 star is that I changed phones, and when I downloaded the game to new phone I had to start over again! No way to log in and continue from where I left off. Not happy as I spent a good bit of money on this game in the past. Very addictive game.",
            "Greatest game ever! Can\"t get enough of this game, please keep new levels coming, no matter how easy, 😜 you are keeping me busy and entertained despite all the chaos in the world. Thank you Raketspel, keep up the great work! This game is the most fun I've ever had on my phone!!!!!! Playing so much, developing DIGGING THUMB SYNDROME.",
            "Its been a good game, with some crazy hard levels. Thats if you dont mind ALL the ads.. But I reached chapter 98 and now it wont open,,goes to the play or insane levels, but NOTHING !!!!!! and there is no way im starting all over !!!! They fixed my bug or whatever,,,i looked for other games while \"dig this\"was down,,and found nothing good... Changed my rating to 5 stars ,and im back playing my favorite game.",
            "Love this game so addictive. Up to level 100.. always look forward to the new levels. The only thing that i can say is the walkthrough solutions are done on PCs and the ball stops giving the player a chance to set up the route..it doesnt work the same on the phone app and some portions of the levels are impossible to pass.. but i do love this game... highly recommend."

            "Mobile check deposit feature seems to have a bug, where it doesn't read the camera's orientation correctly after the first picture taken. It looks like the image is getting rotated again, so it's really squashed and not at the correct aspect ratio. You have to take the other picture manually, as the automatic feature doesn't really work when it gets into this state.",
            "I was loving this app for depositing check, since my company doesn't have direct deposit. But lately, after I take the photo of one side of the check, I can't get a photo of the other side, because the app wants to take the photo in a long skinny \"letterbox\" format. It's quicker to get in the car and drive to an ATM than it is to get this to work. It makes the app useless to me.",
            "This app just sucks. Rarely do I get the notifications that I set up in the app for alerts and if I do get them it's not until several hours later. Sometimes the app will open itself back up after I've already checked it and closed it out. Very frustrating to use. I've had several other banking apps and none have given me the problems BoA does. May be time for a new bank but until then my review of this app stays the same.",
            "This App is wonderful and allows me to have a full banking experience. It even includes a chat feature which guides you through different topics of questions or concerns you have. It's very convenient that you can request a call from Customer service in the App so that you have zero wait time on hold and you generally receive a call within 5 minutes Max.",
            "Terrible check capture. Clearly now a bug where you can only capture one side of a check. All subsequent attempts shows a skewed camera view and nonsensical pop-ups that renders it impossible. Only solution is to close and reopen the app, but you still can't capture both sides. Great timing when people don't want to visit branches in person. No QC at all during the pandemic?"

            "I just created my first invoice using the app and it came out really nice! I love all of the built in features offered, like the payment area, which allowed me to load a picture of a PayPal QR code the customer just scans with their PayPal app to pay the amount due. I enjoyed the fact that I was able to personalize it with my business logo, add a signature if I wanted to, and that after emailing it to the customer, I was notified when they opened and viewed it. I highly recommend this app!",
            "This invoicing tool is simple and powerful! This is on par with our big name invoicing solutions and provides features that I didn't even expect. Emailing with read receipts? Check. Ability to customize and make a professional invoice in less than 3 minutes from initial install? Check. Easy to use interface? Check Customizable Tax, Currency, Business Logos, Item and Services being saved? Check Even exporting for taxes is supported. Get it now!",
            "Love, love this app. I'm a new small business owner and this app makes billing very easy. Its very simple and easy to navigate. It even sent me a 'read' notification after I emailed the invoice . I'm not very tech savvy and able to use Invoice Maker for all my billing needs without difficulty. This app is a life saver.",
            "Ever since the new version came out the app lost so many good features that made me choose this app. The old app would send me a notification when the customer viewer the estimate I sent, which was very useful. They took that feature away. The new version seems very rushed and not thought out, the new version took features away and didn't add anything new. But the app is useful and I don't want to get rid of it just yet because all my customers info is there. So I kinda feel trapped now.",
            "VERY user friendly! Clients' information can be saved for future invoices, invoices can be emailed directly from the app, and the app sends a notification once the receiver has read the invoice. Makes my job SO much easier! I would give 10 stars if I could."

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

Whenever I choose a specific song on my playlist it doesnt play it and ends up playing a different song on my playlist. I updated it and everything, and it still hasnt been fixed. I have no idea if it is a bug, but it needs to be fixed asap.",
            "I've had continuous problems with pandora since I got it. I download songs and playlists, then when I try to play them, it says I haven't downloaded them. It never wants to open unless it has an internet connection, even though all I ever listen to is my playlists in offline mode unless I am actively searching for new music. And now today, with no warning or reason WHATSOEVER, it has erased ALL my music and playlists!!!!! My advice is don't waste your money.",
            "I use it just about every day. The app will automatically close if I pause a song for 1 min to do something on my phone. The app will close and I have to restart it and the playlist. super annoying. I've un-installed and re-installed it, and that helped the crashes that everyone, including myself, used to have. It didn't help the pause and automatically closing issues...I've checked my phone settings on my old Samsung10 5g and they're cool...it is the app that is the issue.",
            "I've been a Pandora subscriber for several years now. I love no ads. Since Last update, Pandora just stops working and closes. I thought it was my phone. Then I changed phones, for other reasons. Still plays for about 15 minutes before having to reopen the app. I hope that bug can be fixed. I have to see all that work fine tuning my stations be all for naught.",
            "Used to work great but now it will shuffle through all songs without playing them , the songs will pop up then the next one will pop up while no music is heard or can be played.

After an hour of chat they said they would forward my case to a manager who would email me. NOT the experience I would expect. NOT the experience I thought I paid for. Google LLC: I have. The runaround is appalling. In fact, I've been trying for over a year... 😔",
            "Google one vpn? Added to my quick settings too soon I guess because it leads nowhere and does not activated a vpn. Also The top comment where the guy talks about google and the chat support during pandemic and always you are talking to people who don't understand anything beyond the view in front of them with not flags on your account...and seriously it's for Google Pay for me too not even google one. But I've had to use both and google one customer service over the phone was almost as bad.",
            "I have been a paid member since 2018 and had somewhere close to 265Gb of music, pictures and videos lost recently. I have not changed any storage locations or folders, just vanished. I had the 2T at $9.99 a month, which I wasnt using, and have nothing to show for it after about 20 years of media lost. Im ending my service today. Update: my bad, I was wrong. 😂 I called and a tech found and copied all my files over.",
            "App states advice from a Google expert 24/7. I always leave feedback and am kind to the operators. They often have no idea what I'm talking about or how to help. I'm usually transferred numerous times, which we're all used to on support lines and especially in a pandemic. I find it disappointing. for example I will select my issue is about Google pay which you can select as an option and the support agent will say you have come through to Google one support and this is not related to the app.",
            "I like it but I don't like it. I like that I get more room to store my photos, docs, videos, and etc. It's very entuitive and easy to use. I don't like it because it doesn't back everything up the way it says it's going to do. Backing up my multimedia messages is harder then it needs to be. It's always giving errors and just doesn't do the job correctly."

            "The newer versions have a lot of glitches and is extremely slow. For example, sometimes I add items to my cart and then they all disappear. Sometimes the app will suddenly have every item listed as out of stock and you have to restart. When you add items and hit + to increase the number of items it takes forever. Hopefully they fix these issues.",
            "This new update is buggy and I can't check out. It took me an hour to fill my cart due to all the bugs and when I finally clicked check out of course that failed too and I lost the last pick-up slot of the day and have to go grocery shopping in the snow now... I have a Samsung Galaxy. The bugs were: search wouldn't work, browse by category wouldn't work, the app kept crashing and removing most of the items in my cart, and when I clicked check out it said \"failed to fetch payment.\"",
            "This app gets slower everytime I use it. It's more like a glitch generator, and an anger creator. But, compared to going inside of that level of hell, there's really no difference, other than not dealing with the public clowns and Karen's. I continue to use this app though. Am I a glutton for punishment, or a slave of this corporate world that is left no other options?......yes.",
            "This ap is FRUSTRATING and is getting worse! The screen constantly freezes, it won't allow you to side swipe when you are supposed to be able to and right in the middle of looking at something the screen will go blank to \"update\" the page and sometimes it will come back up to the page you were on and sometimes take you all the way to the very beginning of opening the ap. And it's not my internet because it's very reliable and the ap does this no matter what service I'm using.",
            "I thought it was me!! I literally bought a new phone to see if it would fix the issues. When uninstalling and reinstalling the app I just happened to take a look at the reviews, lo and behold every single person in the world has the same problem I do since they combined the websites,hece it completely sucks. I like everyone on here I'm going to have to use a different online shopping app for a different store because this app is useless."

            "Very good game but they need to make some changes as it's gotten tedious & boring over the years. The store hasn't had anything new added to it for years; the team game doesnt reward players fairly relative to their input so there's no incentive to participate unless you intend to do little; the tournaments are fun to play but there's nothing in the store to acquire with the rewards anyway so why play. It'd be nice if they'd get creative with the store & add features like stakes for coins in 1v1",
            "Really enjoy playing this game... Game improves speed of thinking, accuracy and concentration... Ads might be little bit annoying while playing, but it is worth it, since they are providing this game for free, with good and simple graphics. Frequency of ads reducing as we proceed to higher levels.",
            "I like Ruzzle, but since the format for earning coins was changed, the game isn't as much fun. Doing surveys for coins is ittitati g, to say the least!!! The added games yield very few coins also.",
            "It takes several mlnutes to get on. Once playing the game often stops and will not let me put any letters in. I do not have this prob!em with other games. I enjoy playing this game with a friend or would unsubscribe.",
            "I usually don't write reviews. But I feel like have to this time. Even though it's a fun word game it's unfair when it comes to the competitions. It is not equal to all. You need coins for upgrades in the competitions. Some players can get 1000+ coins per day by pressing coin rewards and watching adds. While others have a limit to how many adds they can watch. I may only watch four adds per day, rewarding me with 60 coins. There seems to be no interest to solve the problem from the creators."

Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts. Then, when you sign in, you’ll provide your username and password as usual. Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\r\n\r\nEnroll in our beta program!

            "This app is awesome if you forget your passwords frequently or want to add an extra layer of security.. The downside is if you change your password and do not have another way to verify your account (send a code to email or phone number) then you're locked out. Make sure your contact preferences are set before linking your account! Also I have noticed the app doesn't link a lot of services; just Facebook, Microsoft, and Google accounts. I'd like to see more accounts able to be linked.",
            "Amazing app, I really appreciate how easy it is to backup your information so when U get a New Phone, it is so much easier to reinstall with all your info. Let me say one thing, without that backup, it is a BE'ATCH to get authentication up⬆ & running again with all your compatible apps! It is very Time Consuming without that Great Backup Feature!!! My only downfall, I am having big problems with PayPal... it is Never the right Code... WHY❓ It is driving me insane & it is really a problem for me❗",
            "Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works perfectly for Microsoft accounts, and is acceptable for others. I can't have all the codes showing at once, which means an extra tap each time I go to use the app, and I'd like to be able to customise icons for accounts to make it easier to spot the one I'm after. Other than minor niggles, I'm good.",
            "I have no choice but to use this app for my organization, but recently it began requiring me to \"unlock\" the app. I had no idea how to do this so I had to Google for an answer. Turns out you have to use your mobile PIN or biometric to unlock the app. I feel like my phone PIN has been compromised and provided to Microsoft. Unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the usage reporting that is enabled by default that I discovered when turning off this unlock feature. Sorry Microsoft, I do not trust you.",
            "I recommend this application. It is convenient to keep your account security verification code secure. When you login, it ensure that no one will login to your account without your permission. I also love this app more than google authentication. You can backup your info link with your email. It is very good when compare to other authentication app."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

            "The application is just perfect with a humongous range of definitions. I've been using it for years now but since last 6-8 months I am unable to use the pronunciation feature. Seems to have been botched. It hasn't been rectified despite umpteen updates. I request the developer to look into it. UPDATE : the function is back and as unflinching as ever. Thanks a lot for your support. 5 stars!",
            "I genuinely love this app. One feature I wish this app would have tho is similar to that of Quick Dictionary's, like even when I'm on another app or reader and I click or copy a word, it instantly shows meanings and other infos of that word without actually leaving the reader/app. It's basically like a pop-up thing. That feature would make reading much more easier. Other than that, this app is perfect. I have other dictio apps, but I just can't let go of this one. Thank you so much!",
            "This is the best dictionary app to use as it does not need the internet, has current words and slangs along with abbreviations defined, and also has an audio to help pronounce the word correctly. Although, there are some words not having much synonyms to allow a person to find alternative words when writing a paper of any sort. But all in all, this is a far better dictionary app",
            "I've been using it for quiet a while with my pocketbook reader and it was perfect but since the latest update I'm unable to go directly to the searched word from the reader ( as it used to be ) but it points to the start page of the dictionary. This problem is commun to both English and French dictionaries. Thanks",
            "Best dictionary I have ever used. It is offline and has a comprehensive description on every word's meaning. My favourite is the persistent search function and recommendation bar. It even has scientific words and many more which is very applaudable. I really recommend this application for all because I trust it WILL make you understand every word's meaning. Five stars to you, English Dictionary!"

            "Typical google chaotic mess... Google dumps apps, replacement to come at some point in the future... Don't hold your breath! Buy an app on your phone... Can't install the companion on your watch as the play store won't allow repurchase and gives no option to just install... Am at the point where I hope google does get split up by the US senate... Maybe then we will get some competition and decent freaking applications with support!! Google currently SUCKS!",
            "I have tried to connect my Oppo watch. Application freezes at 8-10% I have tried previous versions, nothing... Tried other devices the same... Disappointing. Now I must wait for Google to fix this so I can use my smartwatch.... Till then I can admire it in its box. I was a huge fan of wear os... From now on.... NEVER AGAIN :) :)",
            "Functional but I do feel it's gone backwards. I don't even have the option to show battery levels now. Must be something wrong in the licensing agreements as less and less people despite this being the future of tech seem to be using. Mobile and search being Googles main stay. Feels the same for Home platforms. I'm a Google fan but watch out for the monster that ate blackberry",
            "I recently updated this app, and none of my notifications pop up anymore! They don't even notify me until I have to open up my phone again, is there anyway possible ya'll can fix this?",
            "Ever since I update the application, I can't even receive any notifications (whatsapp, IG, Facebook, email etc). I have tried restarting my Oppo Watch four times and and my phone three times but to no avail. I don't want to do a factory reset my watch since I dont want to lose my data and especially since I can't guarantee it will works as usual. And please dont tell me to inform this on your Wear Os Community because I did emailed to you yesterday and I haven't receive any feedback from you."

            "Used AVG protection for years and always been happy with it. Used on Windows OS before and now on Android. I like the new additions to AVG protection that are useful when using Andriod nowadays instead of Windows e.g. Ram Boost because it is easy to end up with lots of programs running in the background no longer needed but still open and using up RAM.",
            "I ordered the yearly subscription Ultimate edition and WONT show up in subscriptions when I log into website so it won't allow antitheft to be setup. VPN also won't allow itself to work. How am I supposed to know if anything else is working on here. I reached out to support and nothing. This is a waste of money. If I could give a lower score I would. Let's ee if I get help now",
            "Paid for subscription that renewed in June but when I open the app it stills says I need to upgrade to pro. Try to link it says no subscriptions found and yes I made sure it was the right Google play account. Stupid when my Google play specifically says I have a subscription but AVG protection app doesn't even acknowledge it. Waste of money, canceled the subscription.",
            "I don't usually install apps from other sites than Play Market, thus my chances to face viruses and prove if the app is reliable have not been high to this moment. Though, I used the PC version of AVG and it prevented some attacks. So, I think, it is effective. Still, there is an actual inconvenience: \"Web Shield\" stops working from time to time and user has to renew its permission to work in the settings of the mobile phone (Sony Xperia). P.S.: Thank you, I followed your advice.",
            "Generally happy with the app, but not happy with adverts popping up, when I am trying to select apps to hibernate. Some of these ads, spring up, with no obvious way of cancelling them, and can easily be activated, by accident. I am a pensioner, using the free version, as I cannot afford the de-luxe version"

It immaculately cleans all the cache , and has an option to select which files to delete, which if not present would create a lot of problem. It also checks before deleting.Clears trash very fast. Love this app 😻",
            "Ever since I did the updated to Android 10 things have gotten worse. Camera does not accept micro usb, cameral will not save pictures and had deleted pictures on SD card without warning, apps have been slow or icons show they are there and they deleted by the update etc..Not happy at all.",

            "Pretty enjoyable, better than checking Bulbapedia multiple times for sure. Being able to check locations, sprites, moveset, type matchups, BST from all of the 890+ pokémon with no problems at all, is really satisfying. Interface is pretty solid, and even thinking that having to pay for the premium to use dark mode (who I'm a huge fan of), is still not a big of a deal, and for sure won't make me dislike this app at all. Probably my favorite Pokédex app I have ever seen. Keep up the good work! ❤️✨",
            "I love this app, and all of the team builders that I can save. Its great for my mind that won't shut up. My only issue is that for the team builder, I can't select regional forms of pokemon for my team (i.e. Galarian Ponyta). I can evolve some (i.e. Pikachu) to it's regional form, but not the ones that don't have a split evolution. Aside from that, its a wonderfully made app with frequent updates!",
            "This is amazing!! I can look at the locations and for the upper gens 5-8, I can actually check the area, like for Sword and Shield, not only does it tell me where the pokemon appears in, but I can see the conditions such as \"It only appears when it's raining\". If I have one problem though, it has to be the cries of the gen 8 pokemon. They sound very low quality and in some cases, it sounds a bit like your device's speaker is broken. Crown Tundra is here, aling with the locations!",
            "This app literally has everything you could possibly want in a pokedex app. It has a full pokedex/itemdex for information and location, and team building with in depth analysis of weaknesses and coverage. There is nothing left out! I dont see how any other app can compete with what dataDex offers. Not to mention they update the app often so they are always giving the most new and accurate information! 5/5 EZ",
            "Very nice app, and it could be great! Would love to see the ability to search through all available swsh pokemon, and not have them broken up by galar/isle of armor/crown tundra. It's super nice that I can sort the dex by a stat, but i wish i could sort every pokemon. Also, there are some issues with the move dex. I don't think that the \"Pokemon who learn this move\" works right. I'd also love to be able to sort by moves available in swsh. Not just moves introduced in swsh, and no removed ones."

            "Enjoying playing the game. It's so addicting I'm going to have to set a timer. I really like the game but I continually get a network error then the game reloads. With the help of Emma's Adventures tech I no longer have problems. I unplugged my router for about three minutes then plugged it back in. After getting back online, everything is running smoothly. In the future, I'll unplug and see if thar fixes the problem before driving the tech crazy with all my messages to them for help.",
            "I like the challenges and how you build up your town the way you want it . I have been playing this game for a while now and still like it but 2 major issues . The ships that come in you should have the same option as the train to let it go even if you haven't filled it . The guild is not great most of the time its too hard to help people compared to other games such as township in that game being part of a guild is what makes the game fantastic. a few changes would make it fun and enjoyable.",
            "So far the best game I have played from play store. I have not spent any money. I am level 53. They always add more content to keep playing. Not everyone will like this game because we are all different. Most people will find it just fine. It is not a pay to play game but if you like it...you can support the developers by buying things if you wish to. I have received no compensation for this review nor do I want it. This is a great game!",
            "Very slow. Not able to advance as quick as I would like to. Stuck on home, going around the crops and animals, since started. Unable to go to other areas without getting stuck. !!!!! Has improved a lot. / Hate it when it goes off while playing at a good moment..... One problem is as I am working on this game, it switches off. So frustrating 😡 . How long will I have to put up with this?",
            "I really like this game but the further you progress in the game, the more energy points it takes to do anything. You spend all your time filling orders just to kill time until you have enough energy to actually play the levels. And then you only have enough energy to clear a bush or two and then wait for an hour. Clear a bush, wait an hour. It becomes far too tedious to want to continue."

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

Then I started trying out all the different games available, & found I enjoy playing them. I esp appreciate having access to all those games without having to download separate apps for each one. I look forward to seeing MetroZone when I turn on my phone now.",
            "Love the stories, articles, and pictures that are available on this app. However if you hit back at the wrong time or click on another story, you have lost that great item of whatever you were looking at for that moment. . So many good stories I was looking at but lost them that way. And still haven't found them. . Is there a way to avoid this???or solution to fix this..",
            "I absolutely HATE that every time I open my phone, this is popped up. And it's almost impossible to close with the combination of lag and the home bar not being on my screen. It'll click on an article when I try to swipe up to hit the home button. Then it takes ten years to finally close out the unwanted redirection. I'm seriously considering switching services because of this god awful pop up annoyance.",
            "Some of the information is not appropriate to watch and some give too much details. Which takes too long to get to end of story. If you lose page accidentally it hard to get back to where you left off. That make you not want to open story to fine out how, what, why,and when it happens. So I find myself just reading the captions and doing the few selections of pictures. Thank you always for your variety of subject matter.",
            "I did NOT ask for this app to automatically pop up once I unlock my phone!! It is extremely agrivating because I cannot just \"uninstall this app!?!?\" It is also very agrivating & annoying to try getting off of the app to get to my homescreen. I wish I had the option to use the app or not... Why even make a shortcut to access the app when it just (automatically) pops up???"

            "This app allows access to carrier services far better than the previous update. Whereas before, my carrier services were running sluggish, now they are much faster and more well maintained. I thoroughly enjoy the smoothness and quick transitions. The app operates just as you'd expect, in a fast, complete, not to mention timely, as well as stylish manner. I cannot recommend this enough. Since this app is a gift from god, I say it's high time for a cult to be formed. Hail carrier Services!",
            "I have never had any problems with this absolutely much needed APP. I did go to the assurance wireless phone store, through assurance wireless, I got a great LG DYNASTY. This phone works great with the assurance wireless service. No issues calling or receiving calls, data, or text, anywhere in the great 48 states. My husband and I have traveled back and forth to from Kansas to Oregon and back again, to Arkansas then back to Kansas.. My cell service only failed, when everyone's did...",
            "This app worked fine for me when I installed this for Google Messages on my Note 10 5g. I did so for chat features. My husband has a Galaxy S10+ and it is saying his carrier does not support this service. I'm not sure how that works, considering they are literally on the same plan. It just keeps saying retry, verifying phone number when I try to enable chat features. I would give 5/5 if it worked.",
            "My phone is unreliable since the last update. The phone body is hot, my battery is low after 2 hours. It turns off randomly, I even had to buy a classic alarm, because when I go to bed, my phone turns off during the night despite the battery was fully charged. Please please do something! This app eats up my new phone what haven't had any problems before.",
            "ever since the last update that I did things have been shutting down right and left and I have been doing a little bit of research and cannot understand why two similar apps have to be installed on our phone such as Carrier services and carrier hub when basically they both do the same thing if one is reading the description in the Google Play store"

On the Bingo like game it will not give me credit when I clear a space. Unloaded and reloaded no help. Had this game for a long time and this is the first time i had this big problem.",

I absolutely LOVE the sounds and watching all the super colorful bubbles fall into the cauldrons💞 EXCELLENT JOB, KING'S BUBBLE WITCHES! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL 💫🔮",
            "I love this game yet, level 136 can't be passed! The game doesn't give enouh bubbles and with no boosters, it's not passable! Three days trying to advance, is just irritating! I am fixing to uninstall if I don't pass it after today. Ridiculous!",
            "I love bubble witch saga games. However I've wrote twice now about being screwed out of extra bubbles I've purchased and I'm unable to send or receive extra lives from anyone. None of my friends even show up to send lives to and I know a bunch of my friends who play. Fix these issues and give me back the gold I was cheated and ill change my rating.",
            "I love this game but got to level 812 and can no longer pass this level I do not understand what happened either nor where to go to find out why I can not move forward in this game..worked hard to get this high so do not want to start over.but had a blast getting to this level"

No option to program it not to block those numbers so I have to turn the blocking off. Also everything prompts you to go premium...I thought the last uncarrier move said this would be free? Now it just feels like a additional ploy to get money out of us...sneaky.",
            "It's been a long time coming for this app and finally its here Thank you T-mobile I no longer have to go through phone call after phone call. I would get more phone calls from scammers more than my own personal calls on a daily I never wanted to answer my phone cause I just knew it was probably a scam of some sort I can't explain how annoying that is. So thank you so very much T-mobile....",
            "**Response to developer: Scam block is already turned on, it just doesn't work very well. Make the app better instead of blaming your customers please.** Doesn't block very many calls, but has blocked calls from contacts. That can be fixed by adding them to favorites, but it's still annoying. I liked it better when the TMobile system would say \"scam likely\" which seems to have been discontinued after this app launched. It sounds good but doesn't work very well.",
            "Useless, reroutes spam callers to voicemail. Basic app notifications are locked behind paywall. Just download Google Phone cause unlike this it's free, it works, and you can mark callers as spam from the phone app immediately, unlike this where you wait hours . App has a problem where voicemail calls and unknown numbers call don't appear, so you cannot mark them as spam. The entirety of this should be free for all T-Mobile customers. Better yet opensoure it, so people can fix it.",
            "At first this worked great. I wasn't getting any calls that ever said scam likely. Until the last few weeks I have been receiving four or five calls a day from a number that has the same area code and prefix as my number. I block the number, just to get another call from the same area code and prefix. Of course I don't answer. I block, they change the last four digits in their number and call again within 10 minutes."

Nothing to click on to proceed any further. Just the main screen. Read the reviews for the gane and seems to me like the devs for this gane arent sure what they are doing. Waste of time.",
            "Very challenging game. Excellent girls, can build soldiers to whatever strength you want according to your resources. Would recommend this game if your diligent. The bad, it's a little glitchy, have had 2 uninstall and reinstall several times this last week in order for the game to load. Also likes to disconnect from the server, occasionally it won't reconnect. Once required a reinstall. Fortunately no game play was lost and no penalties. Kudos to the DEVS for the mini game and variety.",
            "The is a good game but it sucks that you have to collect 800 puzzle pieces for most girls and sucks that the girls never get put in the rotation, so I have alot of puzzle pieces and never get the chance to get them, unless they start putting back into rotation then I'm going to delete the game",
            "Beware, extremely low probabilities and undisclosed gacha odds. Did over 150+ searches and did not gain a single point in progression towards a character. Needs more work and bug fixes. Half of the content says \"Coming Soon,\" and even a screen still shows as \"Beta testing.\" Servers are pretty much dead, no social aspect and lacks co-cop related content. Also don't like that some events run at 4am in the morning and only last 2 hours.",
            "Fun enough game if you're patient. The beauties are ridiculous but entertaining and at least they aren't Anime style. There's enough to do to keep you coming back and figure out. Like that if you miss out on something it will come around again in a few months. PTP helps but you don't need to if you're patient and don't mind grinding it out."

It is completely malleable, and it addresses all levels of\r\nmemory, knowledge, comprehension, reading, and writing.  From a child stricken with\r\nlow-functioning autism, to a senior citizen who has had a stroke and now suffers from\r\naphasia, to someone who has had a tracheotomy or laryngectomy, to someone suffering\r\nfrom MS, Cerebral Palsy, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, brain trauma or legions, or to a person with\r\ndeafness or muteness who wants a convenient way to communicate with people who don’t\r\nknow sign language, VOCALYX can be a life changing tool to those who need it.\r\n \r\nIn short, VOCALYX can compensate for three types of speech problems: vocalization\r\n(for example in the case of throat cancer), language (as is the case for aphasics), and\r\ncommunication (in the case of autism). The principle is simple: you click on an image (a\r\nphoto, pictogram, or text box) within a premade or personalized keyboard, and VOCALYX\r\nsays the message for you through the use of voice synthesis, or with the recorded voice\r\nof either the user or someone close to him/her.\r\n \r\nThe parameters are 100% customizable to meet the needs of all our individual users. This\r\nincludes: the size and number of buttons displayed, the length of button presses (useful\r\nfor people who tremble because of Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s, or MS for example), the\r\nsynthetic voice (age, gender, speed), and there are several different forms of visual\r\ncommunication.\r\n \r\nThere are keyboards made up of pictograms, photos, and prewritten phrases, as well as\r\nABCD and QWERTY keyboards. When using the pictogram and photo keyboards, you have\r\nthe option of either using the images we have already provided and organized, uploading\r\nyour own personal images, or searching through photo and pictogram databases, like\r\nARASAAC, MAKATON, or PECS, and downloading a wide selection of images.\r\n \r\nAn internet connection is not required to use VOCALYX, except during the registration\r\nand the initial set up. It is usable in all situations and any normal place one would go on a\r\ndaily basis. Take advantage of the free trial and discover how much this AAC tool can help\r\nyou or someone you love!

It is completely malleable, and it addresses all levels of<br>memory, knowledge, comprehension, reading, and writing.  From a child stricken with<br>low-functioning autism, to a senior citizen who has had a stroke and now suffers from<br>aphasia, to someone who has had a tracheotomy or laryngectomy, to someone suffering<br>from MS, Cerebral Palsy, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, brain trauma or legions, or to a person with<br>deafness or muteness who wants a convenient way to communicate with people who don’t<br>know sign language, VOCALYX can be a life changing tool to those who need it.<br> <br>In short, VOCALYX can compensate for three types of speech problems: vocalization<br>(for example in the case of throat cancer), language (as is the case for aphasics), and<br>communication (in the case of autism). The principle is simple: you click on an image (a<br>photo, pictogram, or text box) within a premade or personalized keyboard, and VOCALYX<br>says the message for you through the use of voice synthesis, or with the recorded voice<br>of either the user or someone close to him/her.<br> <br>The parameters are 100% customizable to meet the needs of all our individual users. This<br>includes: the size and number of buttons displayed, the length of button presses (useful<br>for people who tremble because of Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s, or MS for example), the<br>synthetic voice (age, gender, speed), and there are several different forms of visual<br>communication.<br> <br>There are keyboards made up of pictograms, photos, and prewritten phrases, as well as<br>ABCD and QWERTY keyboards. When using the pictogram and photo keyboards, you have<br>the option of either using the images we have already provided and organized, uploading<br>your own personal images, or searching through photo and pictogram databases, like<br>ARASAAC, MAKATON, or PECS, and downloading a wide selection of images.<br> <br>An internet connection is not required to use VOCALYX, except during the registration<br>and the initial set up. It is usable in all situations and any normal place one would go on a<br>daily basis. Take advantage of the free trial and discover how much this AAC tool can help<br>you or someone you love!

The emphasis is to teach clinical judgment for determining cognitive impairment.\r\nWe do not advocate for a global score to determine impairment. \r\n\r\nThe MICA App provides a 10 – 20 minute cognitive assessment battery, called the MICA Test, which provides an overview of cognitive performance by including tasks for assessment of the six main cognitive domains. This can be done as a standalone test and provides an indicator of strengths and weaknesses for each of the main cognitive domains. \r\n\r\nWe also list the six cognitive domains with assessment tasks for each to examine the individual domains more closely. This is useful when a clinician wants to limit testing to a specific domain. The tasks have been selected based on experience and are more specific for the domain as listed but overlap will always occur and the clinician must review the accompanying instruction booklet for further information. \r\n\r\nCognitive tests for common clinical scenarios in neuropsychiatric practice are provided. This version of the App starts with a short assessment battery for depression. Future updates will include batteries for early and moderate stage Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and schizophrenia. These batteries give guidance for clinicians regarding appropriate cognitive assessment for a given situation.  \r\n\r\nAn educational booklet and videos are provided to educate and explain the tasks. The user of this App is strongly advised to go through this before using the App. \r\n\r\nThe MICA App does not provide medical advice for treatment and cannot replace clinical decision making.

Dive into the various configuration options, not only you can quickly glance and get the battery info but, Energy Ring adds an accent to your phone's camera lens.\r\n\r\n\r\nGot a full charge?

So will the arc of Energy Ring.\r\n\r\nOut of the box features:-\r\n\r\n✓ Energy Ring can be configured from a width of 1 pixel to a donut thick ring\r\n✓ Energy Ring puts almost 0% load on CPU, as it wakes up only to reflect any change in battery level\r\n✓ Energy Ring's direction can be configured as clockwise/bidirectional/anti-clockwise\r\n✓ Energy Ring can hide on fullscreen content (apps, videos, images, games etc)\r\n✓ Energy Ring can be configured to change colors automatically depending on the live battery level\r\n✓ Energy Ring could have a mono color/multiple color segments/gradient (pro)\r\n✓ You can literally assign any color in the world for your favorite configuration\r\n✓ Energy Ring has a number of cool animations whenever a power source is plugged into your device\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that is cool! But what about Energy Ring consuming Battery?!\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most exciting question for me to answer. Energy Ring more than anything understands that you need to utilize your battery efficiently (after all, that's why you installed the App, right? ;) .) Energy Ring sits on the screen silently putting almost 0% load on CPU, if battery level changes, Android wakes up Energy Ring. Once awake, Energy Ring quickly updates itself and goes back to sleep. And to be that extra efficient, the Ring goes on deep sleep when you turn off the screen, meaning it doesn't even read changes in battery level when the screen is off.\r\n\r\nAccessibility Service Requirement:\r\nAndroid requires Energy Ring to run as an Accessibility Service, to be able to display on Lock Screen. It does not read/monitor any data, whatsoever.

            "I really like the placement of this power visual. The fact that it uses an almost impossible space as a battery meter is GENIUS. It uses very little resources. I can tell at a glance where my power level is at. The customizations are right on the money, not to many and not difficult to adjust. BUY THIS APP ! Thank You, for a job superbly done!",
            "I love the app, but after you close it using the list with the opened apps as cards (usually the square button on the bottom), the ring seems to disappear, and unable to reappear (app keeps saying that I didn't turn on Energy Ring, while I did), forcing me to clear all app data, also resetting my options. I did turn on battery saving on the app to no restrictions. My phone is Redmi Note 9 Pro.",
            "This works as it should and I love it. Really love the way you can select the colours yourself for it. Paid for the app to support it. My problem is the popup telling me about the settings and the \"we don't support forever on because of screen damage. They always crop up at the wrong moments and I find that frustrating. Any way to turn them off?",
            "Very clever and efficient use of the camera punch-hole. Works well on my OnePlus Nord as I was using the built-in battery circle option before. Minor grumbles: 1. The Ring Origin angle could do with snapping every 90° and the actual value displayed. 2. Choosing white for the Color Configuration still has white text on the white background. 3. The middle of the punch-hole is filled black, not left transparent - only seen when taking a screenshot.",
            "I have been using this app on my OnePlus 8 phone. It's working fine as of now, however an irritating issue of \"Information\" popup with a guide on Battery Optimization appears on every restart of the phone. The popup keeps on appearing even after going through the complete guide every time. Developers should take care of this bug soon as this is an interesting app and users would want to take advantage of it without getting so annoyed."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "This App is useless for me because its only for people who are students in elementary middle and high school so I have no clue why this app is on my phone if I can't even use it and that's the problem with Currents if you're not a student you can't use it at all.",
            "Didn't install! Just like everyone else it just appeared in my apps. My phone's memory is almost full and is slow at times so I decided to delete some apps. When I went to my apps this was here! I NEVER downloaded it so not sure how it got on my phone! I know nothing about this app so I better be able to remove it! Everything associated with this app better be removed!",
            "Suddenly appeared on my device. Not quite sure what it does (appears to Google's answer to compete with Microsoft Yammer for internal office communications?). I open it and I get a \"Google+ is shutting down\". Click the 'X' button and am prompted to login. Upon logging in, I'm presented with the same \"Google+ is shutting down\" message in a UI flow loop.",
            "It just downloaded this updated app when I reset the tab. First time I let the app update as I always disabled google+ before it had the chance. I open the now currents app to get a page that says google+ is no longer and when you close the page it reopens that's all this app does. What is currents then and why did this not functioning app just update and end up taking even more space?"

It would be a great feature in this app to be able to save, search, or favorite certain presets... like the preset texts. Overall, Great App. Good job. Plus, thanks for all the cool things available with this app for free.",

There are so many things to do with this app, even with the free version. The only issue I have is sometimes a picture will become pixelated however majority of the time, the outcome is great. Definitely my favorite photo editing app",
            "You can do alot of customisation and there are presets available for free which are enough to get you going, you can make realy nice edits with what's there you just need to get creative with it. and there aren't any ad pop-ups, insted they're on the side of your editor and don't get in the way of anything which is great. But most importantly you get full detail on the type of image you want to export and it gets saved in high quality. This is the best editor for free and highly recommend it!",
            "App keeps crashing I have been using this app for a long time now, have had problems in the past but now it keeps crashing as soon as it's opens. So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still keeps in crashing. I have purchased a LOT of effects, so I really need this to work. I gave 1 star because of this problem, if you can get this working for me I will upgrade the rating.",
            "Bestest ever... Amazing app with ennumber of filters & effects. I've been using it for 3 years now and I love it! my all time favorite app. Easy to use and very impressive and the great part is that its almost add free. I strongly recommend it to everyone."

Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemic🤍 God Bless🤍"

            "This used to be a decent feature of pixels but now it is so convoluted that it's just a nuisance. It doesn't recognize my voice EVER, not even if I prompt it by swiping. Sometimes it pops up randomly when I'm driving and then it still gets nothing. Microphone issue? Doubtful. Also when it pops up on the bottom it covers the keyboard lol great! The list of negatives goes on and on. Why do I need to \"train\" my google assistant every 2 weeks when it's constantly listening to me anyway? Garbage app.",
            "It's an amazing thing; to have this kind of technology readily available at all times, on a personalized level, and small enough to fit in your pocket... for free. However, Google Now was far superior in functionality. Not sure why the step backwards in this seemingly mandatory \"upgrade\", but regardless, it's pretty amazing. I use \"Ok, Google\" probably 10-15 times a day for all sorts of things. It can even answer some two-part questions, and handles most tasks without the need to intervene.",
            "Yes I have numerous suggestions: 1) is for it to read what I ask it to specifically any text message, new or old. 2). If I'm driving down the road and I ask it to tell me something or read the entire paragraph or whatever I don't want it to stop I wanted to recognize that I'm driving and it needs to tell me that it ignores what I'm asking. 3). It would be nice to refine searches previous ones and edit them. 4). More interactive follow-on conversation option. 5,). Able to diagnose, troubleshoot",
            "This used to be a great app but just recently it stopped working at very random times. For example if I ask \"Show me a picture of Mark Hamill\" it will respond with \"Sorry. I don't understand.\" Also, I use the voice feature all the time and the app has stopped hearing my voice (not all the time but again very randomly). Since I use the app frequently, this has become really annoying. At this point, it's about 50% unusable right now, so if you could fix these issues it would be great.",
            "I'm not entirely sure what's wrong but I've trained it a couple times and it still doesn't respond to me but if I use voice search and Google reads a paragraph to me from the web and it happens to have \"OK Google\" or \"hey Google\" in it, it responds. my voice does not at all sound like the default voice that it uses to read, but it still responds regardless. that's the only time I can get it to respond usually."

I have loved the cricket experience so far and I've been a customer for about six months now and would recommend anyone with a contract to think about switching. Low monthly plans.",
            "EDITED Review: Initially it worked great. Five dollars off with auto pay via app. Cool, ty. Then it started saying my debit card wasnt up to date (its 2 months old) when all was correct. To pay over the phone or in person there is a \"customer service\" fee. So between the 5 I would get from auto pay savings and the fee I pay 10 additional dollars per month because of this faulty app. Essentially I have been repaying 1/3 of my bill due to their error.",
            "Data stinks and my phone slows to fast and I have access unlimited data. U can't even get a new phone. I rather go to simply mobile or metro pcs. The phone I bought was from rent a center years ago, it's a Samsung galaxy J7(2016) version. So it's not a cricket model, I haven't had a cricket phone since several years because I was having problems with every phone. Metro will let you get a free phone for Switching. I'm on a very tight budget and fixed income.",
            "Besides the fact that the app sometimes won't work. There is the issue that when you have a phone that's not working it's hard to get in contact with anyone. I've even tried the customer service line for my cell phone. But without being able to review the items that we purchase through cricket, they aren't really able to know when a company is providing crappy product. I've also had an issue with the last two devices that I've purchased not being able to connect to wifi!",
            "Their websites don't work, their app doesn't work! Made faithful payments for over four years. Missed my payment on the 1st But it wasn't due till the 2nd. Tried to make payments all day on the 2nd and couldn't get through. Then I get charged $15 because I make the payment 9 hours late the day after. When you called to complain the manager will just hang up on you! Even if you don't swear! Worst company! Most of them don't understand English!"

            "You remember 1942 on your Commodore C64? This is nothing like it. All enemies and bullets seem to be magnetic and you basically have no chance to 'win' this game. This is another game that's just trying to squeeze some money out of the player for exactly zero value. They even offer airplanes for $49.99. You can buy a proper game for that kind of money. Ten cents would be too much and I'm sorry for everyone spending money on this",
            "To the developer of this game, you need to fix the score of the PvP game it is not right .No matter how you fight the opponent by looking the time and the score it suddenly the other opponent had a higher score even if you are ahead. How can you explain that sometimes the score is right and you can tell that you are losing because the end of the game its just stuck that you cant even move. Very bad pvp games.",
            "Had 300.000 gold, 3150 gems when they just disappeared when I started playing today. Thats a big, big flaw that needs to be corrected fast. It takes some time building up alot of gems and gold. A bug like that is unacceptable. I am very disappointed. As of 3Sept cannot access PVP mode, special event mode, as well as other game play modes really???, especially when it says server not available. Your E-mail for support is not valid. Fix these bugs.",
            "At first, the game is great. Good old 1942, however after longer play you realise how unbalanced the game & reward system are. If you don't buy blue diamonds for real money, forget about getting high quality planes/weapons. Playing long hours only gives you minimum coins or diamonds (if you buy them for coins). But the most annoying is the lucky wheel - 1 ticket costs 5000 coins and you usually (8\\10) win only 10 diamonds which is minimum. Too many more negatives to mention, hence 2stars.",
            "I love this game but this is the fourth time it has crashed on me and taken over a years worth of watching videos to build up my aircrafts. I'm guessing this is what happens when you do not spend money on the app."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

The repetitive nature of it is stimulating and rewarding because he feels like he is doing work. But he knows what to do and it isn't overwhelming. I thought that he would find it too simple because his favorite game is Minecraft, which is very challenging. But the music and graphics really strikes a chord.",

            "Used to be a brilliant game and loved playing. However within the past week app constantly crashes, especially when trying to use Boosters. Thinking it was an issue with my phone I uninstalled and reinstalled apps, lost all my boosters, silver coins etc the only thing that saved was the level I was at. Instead of being a relaxing game it's now really frustrating to play.",
            "It's a fun game but you have to admit you cheat. How do I get all but 1 pet off the board and you don't drop pets or the color blocks. If my booster is able to be used you cannot bc it kicks you out of the game. Why do you have us fill the piggy bank and then want us to pay for get the gold bars? They should be free. Why is there no way to win tickets to the circus? This game needs to be tweaked a lil bit and the cheating should stop. Just my opinion though.",
            "This game is becoming a total nightmare for a lot of its Players... it has gone cheat crazy ! I have played it on several devices since 2013.. at first the game was fun & enjoyable...how ever over the past 18 months..it has Had sooooo! Many flaws...cheats...unresponsive ! constantly lags. If you notify the team.. u simply get A very automated! Sorry & ur told to sign in & out of Facebook. .this will solve the issues... well it dose NOT! Solve the constant issues & nor dose it help. 😡",
            "This my favorite game but I have to start over I just wish there's was a way to get back to place I was at this is so easy but I was in the hardest part it helps your mine stay focused and you don't think about nothing because you will want to come back to this game",
            "Updated and glitches all over. If you play a previous level in another section, when you finish and don't check \"Next\", it takes you back to your current level. FRUSTRATING"

We update every week, so keep checking this space for new features and other nifty stuff. <br>  <br>New and Not-so Noticeable:  <br>- Many bug fixes, plus performance and stability improvements. ",
        "comments": [
            "Ever since the update it made it worse. It rings again, that's good. Problem is, people can't hear me but I can hear them. I have to use LINE for the time being until it gets fixed. Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. 👍",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

            "Great App for total piece of mind. However, if you \"dump\" your phone, like I just did, you have to reinitialize the Authenticator on each and every website you had it enabled just as if you had changed your phone or phone number. I forgot to make a list of each of my websites I was using the App on, so I'm having to \"discover\" them as I access them. Yeah, it's a pain, but if it wasn't, the App would be nothing but window dressing.",
            "Another application that helps me make Google that much easier, faster and more convenient for me. I am so glad to see that Google is getting more and more usefer friendly ~ anyone who is interested in learning more about how to use, find or become an expert in the any subject go to \"Google Education\". 🙃 Basically, the authenticor is a great place to use as a second sign in step. It is paperless easy to find, get and use. I am so glad to be able to use this link for my own 2 step varifacation",
            "When I first downloaded this app it worked great. I changed phones and the directions to switch were a little hard to follow but doable. This last update messed my app up because my phone died and I had to replace it. I was able to update it through my Gmail but codes were not working for apps. My old phone doesn't work so no way to transfer from it. I was able to get into FB and turn it off through my laptop. Otherwise I couldn't use it or messenger on my phone.",
            "Make it clear that your accounts don't transfer over to a new device like every other Google app, as I am now locked out of my accounts frantically digging around trying to recover them. It's great at protecting your account but if you lose your device, or get a new one and forget to manually transfer them over I wish you luck.",
            "The worst app which Google has ever created. Do they not ever considered what happened to those customers whom lost their phones? how are we able to transfer an old accounts if the previous phones were LOST. You, Google, has locked me out of several accounts and offer no other options available of unlocking it. This is a shameful act. Do not use this!"

The app should run smoother than ever. <br><br>Plus... we added a sleep timer feature for premium users! Go to settings to check it out.<br><br>If you have any feedback or questions, please reach out to us on Twitter at @audiomack.",

            "Best. App. EVER!! Its amazing! Sure you cant download as many songs as you want, but they are just making buisness! Furthermore, its just great and I am listining to it as I am writing this. I can't think of a better app, spotify is way too expensive as I am a kid. But this here is just an amazing legend. It gets my 5 stars. (It deserves infinite stars though)",
            "I really hate the fact that you know have to upgrade to premium to download as much songs as you want, it really sucks, I've had this app since 2017 when you didn't have to be premium, kinda sucks now you have a limited amount of songs you can download. Also adds are getting worse and worse, need to fix that",
            "audiomack is usually a 5star App ...However, this new upgrade which only allows you to download a certain amount of premiums downloads before forcing an upgrade .... which once was free causing my rating to be as is... i am a long time customer and once im able to download an unlimited amount of download w\\o seeing certain songs being characterized as premiums my rating will increase significantly!!!!!",
            "If I'm being honest. Don't understand the complaints. The app devs need the money that they get for premium, limiting the offline Playlist to 20 isn't bad because you can still have an online one. You just need internet to play the songs and most people have data so I don't see the big deal. The app is good, you find new artist, remix and really anything you want. The staff is monitoring the app constantly from what I've seen and overall just works as a good music streaming app.",
            "First. Anybody on this app that is looking for a Apple music replacement is lame; thats why excluscivity has a fee. Second, if you use Live Mixtapes but are tired of the lack of currensy, this is the type of release access you need. Finally, I use more Audiomack than the LiveMixtapes App, the Apple Music app, because apple is...corporate. Eventually they'll pick it up but Audiomack to me is still getting the links to the streets. Like that Zayetoven release, i cant find it anywhere. Thank you."

I've reported the issue several times not a single response. I can't use my Phone smoothly anymore, everything just hangs😫",
            "Was working fine but the new updates for this app suck , don't know what's going on but it keeps on saying that Samsung Push Services is not responding everytime l turn off my phone or restart it. Its corrupting and slowing down everything l down like typing on a keyboard or pressing buttons when playing a game.THIS NEEDS TO BR RESOLVED SOON AND FAST!!!",
            "I don't know what's going on over at Samsung lately, but the updates are awful! Now notification settings does NOT allow me to prioritize notifications like it used to, and many, many other new glitches! That's a big FAIL! There are other drop-down notification panels in the PlayStore - it's time to try another, more functional one!",
            "After the latest update the app kepps crashing on its own and which makes difficult to use the phone smoothly.. J7 prime is the Phone i am using. Before the update the app ws working fine. Had no issues.. i had to somehow uninstall the update and bring the app to its old version so it works fine. Update made the app to crash on its own. Please help",
            "Not impressed...hate it always saying not working, updates are a joke, only messes up phone causes frustration. I love my Note9, this is my second one, but I did not have this on my original one the first time. If so, it never stood out or cause this many issues or update failures, just hate it!!!"

            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "Easy to load. No ads. Works as advertised. Not a five -yet. If it's still going good a few months from now, I'll come back and upgrade my rating. Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",
            "Have had this flashlight app for a while and love it! It does what it's supposed to do, without all the unnecessary extras, no annoying adds, and it doesn't glitch on me. Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",
            "I've been looking for this app off and on for roughly 7 years, now. All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",
            "Update 10.10.20: Still just one ad, once in a while, to Rate 5, even if its already a 5, just one click back and i'm back to no ads on the screen & Best Light!... THANKS Developer! [ ... 1st day rated5] ... installing... I have been looking for years for a better light and mine is still Awesome... THIS FLASHLIGHT IS SO BRIGHT, YIKES! (btw Previous lights had pop-ups sending me onto Browser etc! NO POPUPS, so far... So Thanking Now! Simple! Sleeker! Brighter! Awesomest,SoFar...",
            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."

            "I've been using this app for a couple months. I think there's a problem with the automatic date it puts on the title line within each note. Today, 10-05-2020 (Oct.05,2020), I noticed my note had the date 10-25-20, so I tapped that date and changed it do the date (09-25-2020) that appears When I close the editing of the active note. But when I close that active note and reopen it for editing, it again shows the date 10-25-20--and I don't know where it's getting that date-- today is only Oct.05.",
            "This app sucks it keeps stopping I have a lot of information on this app that I thought I could retrieve at any time now when I hit the app it just says the app has stopped,and do I want to close app or send a message which I am doing ,this app was working great until recent it just won't opem. I am using version 2.0 701 This app must stop working after you put a certain amount of data on it don't use this app it just keeps stopping .",
            "Buggy.. obviously poorly tested. Would give it zero stars if it were possible.",
            "it does what it's suppose to do no frills no fancy stuff ,I was looking for something I could just write something on real quick notepad does that...I only gave notepad 4 stars because when I first go to notepad to use it there's ad that pops up every time ,,I just hit go back button the notepad is there for me to start writing tommy g So,Cal,",
            "It is a sketchy app. The devs comment and say the permissions you give for them to access your contacts and phone records are for better functionality. However, at no point while I was taking notes did that personal information have any relevance. I made two, brief notes on this app and yet when I went to delete it, the app had used 190mb. The only way that adds up is if it is recording your calls. Supposedly, it filters spam, but I only got a potential spam notice once. Report the app for theft"

            "Good game, but with a huge glitch Far too often, after completing a level, the game just sits there. It's not frozen, but even w the screen cleared, it loads more shooters. You can't shoot them, even though there's nothing to shoot at, and the only way to get out is to minimize and toss the app. Has cost me coins and levels. Probably going to uninstall.",
            "Im at level 200(+). This is a great game to play. Yea it's challenging sometimes to not get the color you need at the right time but it wouldn't be challenging if it was easy, nor would it be fun. People complaining about spending real money on the game are looking for instant gratification(which has become a problem these days). You DON'T NEED TO SPEND REAL MONEY to play this game. You have unlimited lives so if you don't get the color you need at the moment you need it, play again. Simple.",
            "This game is garbage! Ive been stuck on lvls for hours, and now i can even pass lvl 34. Its so frustrating to start a level really hard and not easy enough. The coin amount is terrible too. You just get few coins and that is all, not even 10000 or 100000 or big amount of coins instead of 10 f**king coins. And also $104.99 for just 1,100 coins?!!!? Seriously, this game is just a waste of time.",
            "Sensing a theme here looking at other reviews. Though mine is only occurring in the periodic challenges, it went thru nearly 1h play of either giving me ones I can't use or get near the end only to get ones I can't use and essentially the game is flipping me off. If this continues, I will not make an IAP and will delete and maybe even report foul play to Google Play",
            "It is a good game, gets more challenging as you go. They have changed the ads, so you can't get out of them and added more so they play after every round. Just back out of game and restart, you won't have to watch the same ads over and over. Takes a little longer but don't have to watch the ads. Like most, they just get greedy. Not worth the ads push. Nice graphics and idea, but gets repetitive."

            "Quality just keeps going downhill. Seems like bugs get bigger with each update. Lately, when trying to locate another phone on our plan, it can only tell me the county that the phone is in - which is absolutely useless information. Other times, it can't locate the phone at all. AT&T....if you want people to pay for this app, then you need to get it together.",
            "9/25/2020 Has been much more stable. 7/1/2019 I don't get it, I have many apps but this is the only one that regularly has problems. 11/14/2018 What idiot would discontinue an app that was working perfectly fine before the replacement app was ready? Someone at AT&T is really lacking. Update: And the comedy continues! The new replacement app, \"Secure Family\", is finally here. Location improvements? Can't even locate anyone at all in my family. Now let's see how long it takes AT&T to fix it.",
            "App wont open, keep getting notifications saying the app is updating...been doing this for 3 days..why is it updating for 3 days....not able to use it at all. This type of problem happens all the time, in the past I have had the problem of it opening and then it immediately closes. Even uninstalling and reinstalling does not help. So frustration.",
            "I keep having the app pause and freeze. It states update and freezes. Everytime it updates that happens and it seems to update often like often. I also placed 3 phones on gps and connected their phones for some reason one phone says it is no longer connected since the update and I dont have phone to fix this error but I need this program because the people that have these phones need to be found if they are lost. And I depend on this app to help do that. That's why I have every 1 hr schelduled",
            "This app is terrible. Att Smart Limits was a much better app. Each time I unpause my sons internet access, he has to restart his phone for it allow him internet. Also the GPS is not accurate. His phone was turned on at 9am and at 1pm I get a notification he arrived at school when he had been there all day. You cannot block specific phone numbers like you could in Smart Limits."

Over time it got more and more bloated, plastered with ads and no longer being able to select the sources. I think this last update is the straw that breaks the camel's back. I do not like the new look at all. I have used this app since it came out but I'm off to find greener pastures, the app has lost everything that made it stand out from any other news portal.",
            "Keeps going downhill. This used to be the best news app out there. Now all the forced adds you can't close until timer runs down, make it almost unusable. You already mix adds in with articles then force MORE ADDS on top of that..RIDICULOUS! Suggestion you wanted: Don't add a timers to adds. That just pisses people off. Don't act like this is an acceptable alternative to a subscription fee. Good luck trying to charge one to view other news source's articles.",
            "Love this app. Absolutely hate the new format of the top news tab.Originally I took off just 2 stars, but it just bugs.me so much I hate it. Wish they would put it back the way it was or have the option. ******EDIT****** Rating from 1 to 5 stars. the top news tab had changed so that pictures for each story were large and I could only have 1 headline on screen at a time.So I had to scroll a lot just to scim through.They have put it back to they way it was before! Mostly. Ads are big but thats OK",
            "The ads are minimal (make your money, booboo) But I originally downloaded the app because I thought it cast a wide net of views, but it feels like its just giving me more of what I regularly click on. Still, I get enough to feel tired of the world, which is really all I want from a news app anyway. Good job, persons.",
            "Seems to be excellent... Since my original review, some of the news options come out of left field (crazy). Also when reviewing articles, nonsense symbols show up in the body of text, sometimes making it unreadable. e.g. \"eadquartersâ€™â€œTrump Store,â€�\" So, lose a star on the rating scale."

            "Absolutely hate what you did to this app. You had unique photo styles and great filters to accompany them. You reinvented your app to look and do what every other photo edit app has already been doing. Problem is, your new design is just the base editing tool for countless apps. They offer much more than these basic settings. Very disappointed with the changes. Plus now there is an ad every 3-4 clicks now. This app is just the price of entry tool for most photo edit apps.",

But the disadvantage is it uses lot of RAM! . I think my game would run more faster if this app use less ram. This app take nearly 500 mb of ram. Even though I love this app 👍👍👍👍 . I have been using this app for years and also recommend to anyone who thinks that their phone is feeling unsafe . It is useful",

Am I safe with the VPN included with my AVAST? 5 ⭐ The VPN should start automatically when I'm home on the same network at all times, not using mobile data.",

            "I'm really liking this bingo game but had to give it 3 stars because you only get a set amount of tickets a day and the buy in for the special event games is like 3x the daily amount. To get more tickets other than to buy them you have to complete daily tasks BUT the daily tasks are only eligible in the special event games so they're unachievable. So basically this is a pay to play game after you spend all your tickets given when you first download app.",
            "This game really sucks now! You can't finish the album cause u only win duplicate cards. For over 3 weeks, I have not been able to open my gift box and most of the games, especially any new tournament games. I've lost out on gifts from Tony and being sble to send and receive in the gift box. Fix your damn technical errors!!!!!",
            "When i first downloaded this game it looked nothing like the ads i had seen for it. Then i discovered the more games tab at the bottom of the page and discovered it's an add on for rooms...there i found the games from the ads and many many more. There are enough games here to keep anyone busy for a long time and all different themes and types of play. I'm an avid player and love bingo. But this is quickly becoming my favorite app i've ever used. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"

It's not connecting to my Samsung account. It just keeps on spinning and then say network issue. Get some good developers who can make this app work. Total waste of money.. Not even serious to even look to the review. Well done samsung",
            "Hard to use. Unclear on what some of the applications mean. Not very good graphics. Added 1 star because after using it for a few months, I now realize the great features that it has. Such as listening to music without my phone 😍❤. Adding my pictures from my gallery. The more I use it the better it becomes. October 14, 2020 brings new challenges with this watch. I charged it last night & in the morning after a few hours, it's completely dead. Can't do my morning workout 😫. Taking away 1 star.",
            "Connection problems! Once disconnects, you cannot reconnect it again unless you restore it and lose some data. This happened only recently with the last update. Please fix it! So disappointing... I have unistalled everything and re-installed them back. Everything was switched off and on. Did all the tricks. Nothing works.",
            "Love how small but complete the watch is. Battery life is good. Swim results need some work but it does a good job detecting strokes. It doesnt record kicking or drills. Cant wait to use it for running and weight training! I loved the Gear FitPro and was not looking to spend 500 dollars for a watch that does the same as this one, worth the buy. Only gripe is the music app cant import YouTube music or spotify. That needs to be fixed on the phone Samsung music app sucks.",
            "Battery drain!! YES, THIS WEAR APP IS TO BLAME. The watch is fine in airplane mode, or with Bluetooth on and the Wear app disabled. It's not the watch itself. Enabling the app and allowing it to connect drains the watch battery so fast it is useless. Samsung doesn't know, or actually doesn't care. A couple versions ago this wasn't happening."

            "I love this game very much. But I need a game where there is more than 20 countries. There will 1 airport on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One country to another country. (Suppose that I will go from Japan to USA then I will need to buy ticket, like $1100). There will minimum 3/4 railway stations on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One area to another area . (Suppose that I will go from New York to another one then I will need to buy ticket, like $110)",
            "I liked this game so much but i want new job places like a bank,a post office, a office,a police station,etc.And why is not there any fire department,bus station,etc from where we can take the job.We shouldn't be able to take parked vehicles without its keys. There should more of job like buildings which we can go inside to take keys of the vehicle(for rent) parked for the job.After any job is done we should only be able to get money by collecting it from its departmentbyparking itsvehicle back",
            "I rate five stars not because it's a generally good game, but because it's very janky and it's just perfect. But add more houses, a larger open world, and melee weapons. Thanks!",

            "This app has been fantastic! Completely accurate instantly down to the penny. I also want to add, I have had this app awhile now and I couldn't be more pleased. Someone was taking money out of my account. Huntington caught the suspicious activity immediately. I lost a minimal amount that they are reimbursing. Thank you for saving the rest! Amazing!!!",
            "I find it extremely annoying to be constantly asked if I want to use new tools. These banners get in my way and closing it is just one more step I need to do before having my standard view, without the annoying, unsolicited new feature. It's always something new being offered. At one point I was asked if I want to see how my monthly expenses break down and I said \"No\". But months later it was added to my view anyway. I DON'T care, but they decided I am going to see it anyway. Very annoying",
            "Wheel goes round and round and can't login. Rediculous! It's been weeks now and no help! I still can not use the budget or analysis tools now for weeks. I get no support. The at that is online is so much better, it works. No one seems to care to help. Oh well, that's a shame for Huntington to have an app that doesn't work. What does that say about the bank.",
            "With the Android 11 update, the mobile check deposit was temporarily shut down. When it was available again, the camera options were not functional properly. I was able to take a picture of the front of my check and had difficulty taking a photo of the back of the check. This was because the camera seemed to be distorted oddly, like a fun house mirror.",
            "I have loved the app for years and use it to check my accounts almost daily. However, last week after my pixel did an update, the app is telling me I can't use it for mobile deposits? I don't do very many a year, but hopefully Huntington will upgrade their software soon. Other than that it's great.....but please fix the mobile deposit portion soon!"

Could use some more features like subfolders, or more slideshow settings (like changing speed, randomization), support for more video types (.wmv does not work at all), and the ability to rearrange your gallery. The only current way to get them into an order you want is moving them into a folder one at a time. Aside from all that it works great.",
            "This is a great app! Keeps everything secured. I don't know if they have changed it yet, but the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is when you upload multiple pics or documents, they do not stay in order. If you want them in order, you have to upload one at a time. Pain in the arse. If this has been fixed... Great!! If not, please change this.",
            "Keepsafe seems to work just fine. I haven't had anyone try to unlock it though. I'm only using the basic service, so I do get an ad page from time to time. The ads are not very intrusive though... definitely not like the ads on YouT#be!! I'm happy with this app.",
            "This app is really amazing... And so cool to keep files i love it... how i wish you could stop the access of redeeming codes and also premium access it would be better... Cause ain't everyone using PayPal or credit cards... I hope you see to this admin... please find another way, so many people could benefit from it also... Thanks for going through this.... O.T Zany👌👌😎",
            "I'm gonna have to give this App 4 stars, something that is really missing is the ability to Move saved videos and pictures around in a folder so they can be in the order you want them to be in, also when you try moving multiple videos or photos from your gallery into the app they do not get sorted in the order that you chose them in. Which really sucks, I'm a basic user as I don't have money to put into an app on a monthly basis so that's a let down for those who struggle with finances."

Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",

What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",

            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "This game is great! Lots of levels, very realistic, if you are looking for a non addictive game this one is perfect for you. The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",
            "I will say it is good app for those who really want to become cardiologist. I am intrested in these types of activities. I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",
            "The first sentence in the dialog has a typo. Decided to overlook it. It seems the dialog is very poor and controls aren't any better.",
            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

            "Great system, really handy for the whole family!!! It would make more sense though if you had to tap and hold the items to remove them from the list and just tap once to edit... So basically the other way around. Because the way it works now it happens to us quite often that we accidentally remove items from the list. But other than that, super happy with the app :)",
            "Okay so I've used it for the first time for shopping yesterday, and yeah random things did get added to my list. It was frustrating because it was items that we go through regularly and it made us doubt if we actually needed it or not. Also I wish the inspiration page was bigger. I wish there were 100s of recipes you could search for rather than there be the same 5 recipes on a list. Over all I love the idea of this app, but it needs some work. I'll keep using it for now.",
            "Great app and would normally give it five stars but recently the Wear OS app doesn't seem to be sending notifications? It's strange as I can get notifications from Bring! to my phone when the Wear OS app isn't installed but obviously can't view my list on my watch without the app. But when I install the Wear OS Bring! app on my watch the notifications no longer come through. Any ideas? Have made sure all relevant notification permissions are set up on both the Watch and Phone apps so I don't think the issue is there.",
            "Great app. We live far from town and sometimes one of us will head out to do the shopping. Anything I miss from our shopping list can be sent automatically from my wife's list and vice versa. This is how web based apps should all work.",
            "Amazing grocery/shopping list app.. why? 1) Share lists easily for others to add to 2) Google assistant integration for hands free operation 3) WearOS support 4) stores your loyalty cards in one place 5) clean and intuitive interface 6) responsive development team 7) always improving and incorporating user feedback."

            "I enjoyed it alot, but I finished it really quickly. I loves it so much tho. I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yes🤞"

This used to be my go to game but since you have made it so diffucult I don't enjoy playing. This is supposed to be a game for everyday players not professional gamers.",
            "It was really fun until all of a sudden it got so difficult that I could rarely beat the level without using many boosters or watching videos. I enjoy a challenge and understand they need to make money but it has taken the fun out of it and I'm quitting and deleting the game.",

            "It has everything I want to watch from Disney! I love it sooo much. I had this service since Day 1 and there used to be multiple issues but now it has been a year and it is perfect, no issues whatsoever. I do wish the algorithm for movies recommended to you were on the level that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video has, but I'm sure that will be more finetuned in the future. Overall, I'm very happy with this app and service, and will continue its patronage into the foreseeable future.",
            "Slow. Doesn't load. Says it's my internet but all my other streaming services work great. Hulu, Amazon, Netflix. Wish they would work on that. Also not everything comes up on my watchlist that I have saved. If I manually look for it. It shows in my watchlist but when I go to my watchlist. It isn't there. Downloaded movie to watch on the plane. Didn't work. I like the old Disney movies but not all of them are on here. They say they switch them up but never do.",
            "The app worked great for the first 10 months but over the last month when we're at home watching a movie, the movie will freeze up and then the app will reset. After that, we have to navigate back to the movie. UPDATE.. PLEASE FIX THIS F@UCKING APP! We're paying for a monthly service in which we can't even watch the programing. A corporation like Disney should have a flawless app. The app was perfect and now it sucks.",
            "I love watching my favorite shows on here, but this only works on my laptop and will not work on my phone. I have tried everything to get it to work and the only thing that keeps coming up when I try to watch something is \"sorry cannot play if error keeps happening please contact disney support with code 39\". But like I said works perfectly fine on my computer. I want to watch it on my phone as well, please fix the problem!",
            "This app is pretty good I have enjoyed it so far. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the app runs a slow sometimes but that could be on my end so I wouldn't take that into consideration too much. I also like the shows that are on there now but I was watching the marvel movies and they don't have Spiderman or The Hulk which isn't that big of a deal but if you wanted to watch those you would need another app +subscription. Overall its a good app and is cheap compared to other streaming services."

            "The only reason I'm choosing Pixel Phone is because of the camera. The quality was amazing ALL the time...until the recent update. No use of having great photos if the camera itself cannot be used. I've tried many ways to recover.. but it seems like nothing can be done to fix it. I've read many comments stating the same issue. Dear developer, please do something or you may lose more Pixel user..",
            "Updated phone in October after waiting as long as I could to not update it, and now the camera app no longer works. When I click it just shows a black screen with the camera interface over it, wait a few seconds, then it closes. I tried restarting phone, disabling app, removing other apps, shutting down phone entirely and waiting a while, and even a factory reset. Nothing has worked. Great timing for my trip to Yosemite. Thanks, Google.",
            "Google updated to androoid os 11 and camera won't work, just black screen like every one else. I've done a lot of research on this and it seems to be a widespread problem on not only the early pixels but also the new pixels. Google has had a class action law suit because of problems like this. Google does not care about you or else they would of resolved this. I was going to by the new pixel but now there's no chance in hell will I support the company.",
            "Took my first pictures with my new Pixel 5, the cool 2nd full moon of the month. The pictures are fuzzy, grainy, out of focus. Was excited to try night site. What a disappointment. My Pixel 1 takes better photos. Is this a bug?. Also, where did HDR+ go? No option to toggle or use, obviously didn't work for my moon photos.",
            "Camera stopped working completely after the last update. Tried everything to get it to work. Google was zero help and told me to go use a third party fix it service.... It's THEIR software that needs fixing. Extremely frustrating because my phone is in great condition but now it is useless. A smartphone without a functioning camera??? Do better, Google."

            "I guaranty the people who created this game are from China. All they care about is getting your money legal or illegal. We need to bring legal actions against them. This game is biggest money pit I have ever seen. The good ratings are people who work for the developers. There are alot of bad reviews. There is absolutely no customer service. I purchased a 300 ship upgrade & my credit card was charged but I did not get the 300 ships. When the game steals your money once, it will happen again.",
            "So far, so good! It's actually kinda fun, and a good way to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of that game from back in the day called \" Galaga\" So anybody that liked playing that game way back when....Getcha Pull off this game, and give it a try! 🤘😎",
            "This beautiful game would easily be a 5 star game, unfortunately the devs are horrible. 5 recycled failed events in a row + Halloween event failed. Lost 6 tickets had 7 boss freezes = 2000+ candy lost with no compensation and yes we messaged devs on FB. They don't do anything, literally nothing. No customer service, purchases fall through, 100s of bugs with no help whatsoever. $10 a week for no ads (80+ ads a day). Most of this can be fixed if the devs simply did their job but they don't. SMH...",
            "I admit that while the developers need to make money, one should be able to buy new planes by playing long enough and earning coins. After a point coins are useless and you need the green gems, which can only be accumulated by watching ads mostly. Most of the planes have to have cards which depend on luck. Also wings can never be accessed because it's just too hard. It's sad that a game with such good gameplay is riddled with money making schemes.",
            "I have played this game for more than 2 years. Initially it is fun, but when you get to the higher levels it is almost impossible to progress. You need ship upgrades to progress and they need colossal amount of gems and as you may guess gems are difficult to get. If only the developer were less greedy for cash and more generous on rewards it might have been very good game. Unless you intend to spend a fortune on this game play up to level 60 and find something else."

            "Great game...BUT! Had issues with this game a year ago, but thought I'd give it another go. Graphics and game play are excellent, however I bought credits (AU$70), bet big, won free games (Where's The Gold) then the game froze. Restarted it, recovered the game then froze again. Restarted it, same thing. Third time it just took the free games. No reply from support. You bet big with the hope of winning free games, then it takes away your prize.",
            "This app has the best graphics....but thats it. I've tried buying credits etc to 'pay my way' for better payouts, but all Product Madness are concerned about is making you pay more for something worthless. There is no way you can win any money back, its supposed to be for fun, but you have to pay big ongoing premiums to have any 'fun'. Until l see a better return on the money I've paid so far, they'll not get another penny out of me. You are better off saving your money for real gambling.",
            "I keep wanting to give this game more stars, but they just wont let me. Yes I'm very happy that you put way better values on the daily wheel. Yes I play this game because the games are ones I've played in real casinos...i can't give more than one star because you just make it impossible to win anything...when you go through 5 million coins betting minimum and never get a bonus or win anything higher than double your bet you just want to give up. Plus, the cost of buying coins is ridiculous.",
            "I think its great , you know it costs them money to put these games on here, so to anyone that's not happy just remember these games are free, and entertaining , And it takes our minds off of today's problems, Tomas blanco",
            "Total scam. Fixed games and they expect you to pay for credits? Games don't pay, stupid and totally unnecessary side games (open boxes for items or scratch fixed lottery tickets). The only good thing about this app is that the games look like the real deal but the overall experience is terrible."

            "I like that it gives you the location you are currently located in, upon opening the application for usage. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because if you are on the AT&T network, it would make more sense to not need to have paid for a monthly subscription, and also because the basic mode, that is free of charges to utilize, but only if you do not agree to the upgrade charging your phones billing account, does not use verbally (spoken) directions, to assist the device owner, or individual using the application for navigation, to hear the directions; you must look at the device you are using to see the navigational directions in this application, which I personally feel is a contradiction to the \"It Can Wait\" campaign.",
            "this is a sleazy app. I just got off the phone with AT&t after finding out that I've had a 2-year reoccurring charge for this application. I have never used this app I only use Google maps, so when I ask for e-mail verification or some kind a verification where I would have agreed to the monthly charge they stated that sometimes it comes through text messaging so if you click on the link that is your agreement for your monthly payments. At least I got a $30 credit out the $240+ I already paid."

            "This app is great until it's not. Even though I have all notifications turned off I still get notified about everything. And I mean EVERYTHING! On Sundays suring football season it's one notification after another every two to three minutes all afternoon. If you ever need customer support forget it. There is none within the app. It's literally nonexistent. So if you have a problem, you're on your own. Good luck!",
            "I have turned off all notifications. And I'm still getting notifications on everything, every 30 minutes. I just want to follow my team, at my leisure. If I can't get this to stop, I'll just delete and block the app. I do... like the fact that games are free to watch on the app, makes it convenient on the go, and don't have to wait till I find a tv.",
            "I bought the gamepass option to listen to live games. That does work; HOWEVER, you have to keep the phone display ON the whole time and can't do other apps while listening to the game. Every other major streaming audio service allows the app to run in the background, but not NFL. Very annoying for $100 per year.",
            "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
            "\"Clickbait Notifications\" I like this app, it's clean and clear and has decent reporting. But my word the notifications are infuriating and the reasons I've deleted the app. \"This player from the NFC East has been traded. Open to find out who\". \"A two time Pro bowl player has been benched\". I haven't got time for that. I manage my phone through my notifications, so if your giving my notifications that tell me nothing, I'll go find another app that sends me meaningful information."

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"

Refunded, but please fix these issues and I will gladly buy them again.",
            "nice game and idea is great, but too easy and there are only 10 levels. +bugs. like in two levels it didn't fit the screen (8 and 9 as far as I remember). also sometimes if you playing driver-view it crushes. and one incovinience - after every level you're back in the garage, not on the level map, but you can play all game on one train."

            "Used Groupon at launch, when it was actually a bargain site. Nowadays I hardly use it. If you search for goods on eBay/Amazon, 9/10 times they'll be £3-4 cheaper. I only use the app. Was offered 20% off next order, no code, link, or details. Pressed accept and it said it would be applied at checkout, it wasn't. Spoke to four agents on chat, all copy/paste template replies. When I started complaining, all four pretended they couldn't see my replies and that I'd gone idle and disconnected me.",
            "I absolutely LOVE GROUPON! It is the only app I use for my great deals! I get on there atleast 3 times a day sometimes more! The notifications are awesome! && I love how is a variety of things. The up to 97% off some things blows my mind! Such great deals. If you don't have this app its an amazing app and a great way to save money",
            "There should not be this many daily notifications for the little amount of content on this app. The search is garbage. It routinely shows \"deals\" in my area, amd o then find out my area is apparently two states away. Very few business use this anymore. While these are strange times, this was still the case last year. No worthwhile deals. All the goods sold herr are also pretty garbage deals. They can regularly be had on amazon on elsewhere for the same price as their sale price on groupon.",
            "Total waste of time. First, there were not many deals in my area. Then when we traveled with it, there was not much savings. Then it started charging my card when I did not authorize the charge for a \"groupon select\" there is no customer service to call, only email and online chats. I contacted them for the last year telling them to unsubscribe me, each time I was told it went thru. Is an act of God to get them to answer email or the online chats. They are like a bad case of the herpes.",
            "Some good deals, but not all what they seem and customer service is a joke. I paid $21 for 3 days of airport parking and was charged another $40 when I left. According to the Groupon, regular price would've been $30, so I paid twice as much as I would have without the \"deal\". I tried to chat with customer service twice and got no help, then disconnected in less than 1 min while I was typing a short reply, clearly because they didn't want to be bothered, and this is just one example of MANY."

            "Once I catch on how to maneuver within this app just maybe I'll be able to say it's a good one. One thing I can say is there's too many changes all at one time. Instructions are not always comprehendable. Some of us need \" Google Go for Dummies\"... I like this app, but it's appears when using other apps. Otherwise, interference, unpredictable behavior and isn't stable.",
            "The app is pretty good. As it says it's fun to search and it's life too? The only issue I have is with downloads. We can't download pages like we can in chrome. Since there is no multiple tabs option there should atleast be an option where I can save some sites I wanna read later. If this is the only browser app a person uses like me then it's not so efficient. Coz I disabled chrome since it takes up a lot of space. Please do something about this. Else it's a great app. No complaints. 😄",
            "This app is great, and a great alternative to Chrome and Google. It is very easy to use and it has Google Assistant built into it when you voice search. It has a lite, incognito, and normal. It is very nice how you do not have to download two apps to get lite versions of the whistle your need. It is an all in one app, ready for use I'm ready for improvement. for me it is very good I don't think it needs much",
            "Excellent for many features, 1. Multiple sessions, each search in a separate window. 2. Lite mode, pages load faster and easier to read 3. More convenient search box location. 4. Opens some of the blocked sites in some countries. 5. Has bookmarks to open frequently visited pages. And more... The bad: if you left the app to another app then back, the page reloads again, very annoying when you read and compare two pages.",
            "This is a very good light browser. Very fast, always loads practically instantly even on my 4 year old s7. Very helpful side features; though I dont use them very much personally, I can see that many people would. It gives relevant search suggestions. Some features such as advanced searches are missing, but I have found that I mainly use this for finding a fact or an image quickly. Then, if I need more information, I switch to my normal browser, firefox."

Eight out of ten strokes are preventable – test if yours can be too! #Dontbetheone!\r\n\r\nThe award-winning, fully validated, free to use Stroke Riskometer app is a unique and easy to use tool for assessing your individual stroke-related risk. It calculates your risk through evaluating a series of risk factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, lifestyle and other health factors that directly influence your likelihood of a stroke. It has been designed as a new tool to help individuals and health professionals reduce the risk and incidence of stroke. \r\n\r\nWhen you download the app, you can elect to join an international stroke research study where you can submit your data to help us better understand stroke and its risk factors and develop global prevention strategies. People from 104 countries have already joined the study.\r\n\r\nIn this upgrade, we have fixed some bugs and implemented some new features:\r\n-Improved novel interface with easily understandable navigation.\r\n-Goal setting options for lifestyle and blood pressure control.\r\n-Medication reminder with time setting.\r\n-Improved graphs with monitoring tracking and saving of your progress \r\n-Management advice based on the user’s risk factors profile.\r\n-View experts’ advice videos.\r\n-Extended list of stroke warning signs (F.A.S.T.+).\r\n-Share your results with person(s) of your choice.\r\n-Language options.

And I recommend to make premium content free from such condition. I shared the link but people do not install it. What can I do then? The condition should be limited to just sharing, not installing from the link. Besides, please build an alternative lite version for those people who have limited data or poor interent speed.",

            "Its very interesting game. Also, such helpful team out there. I face some issues while playing this game and i emailed for online support. They not only solve its problem but kept follow up until i got satisfied. Its great",
            "I have always loved bubble shooter games, This time around, I'm starting all over and I still enjoy this type of game immensely!",
            "Made it to level 142, time to uninstall cant get past the level. These games are suppose to be relaxing not so stressful you want to throw your phone across the room.",
            "Can't even get to second level before been bombarded with ads, and ads at bottom of screen. Yes I know ads bring revenue, but there is a balance, between people enjoying the game few ads and get some revenue, or bombarding people with ads and uninstall (like me) and get no revenue. Goodbye."

I'll open the app and it will show the beginning page and it then just goes back to the home screen of my tablet. I'm really disappointed. I though I had actually found a video downloader that worked. Maybe there's an easy fix and I will get to use it again. I can only hope.",

            "App no longer works. I am having the same problems as everyone else: The app notifies you of the message but upon clicking on it, the message time says 0:00/ out of nothing and does not play and is not transcribed. I keep force stopping and deleting the cache but these messages don't load for hours. I don't use the standard call-in voicemail and haven't had a password set up for years. Really frustrating because obviously voicemails tend to be time-sensitive.",
            "ADS??? Are you serious?! Why on earth would you \"update\" this app to include ads? Not to mention, I haven't been receiving my voicemails lately. This is not a good look for me. I love Cricket Wireless. Been a loyal customer for years, but I don't like where this is going.",
            "Flaky is the best way to describe it. Sometimes a VM will show up in the app within a minute of a message left. Sometimes hours later, like 6-12 hours later. Sometimes not at all. I cannot figure out when it'll flake out. And now you jerks PUT ADS in there too? Time to dump you turds.",
            "doesn't work anymore. updated and half the time the messages aren't transcripted and i can't listen to any of them through this app anymore. have to call my voicemail like it's 2005. 👍🏼 excellent 15 steps backwards all around here in 2020.",
            "This app used to work great... but since the update I can't get ANY of my messages to play and it takes 20 minutes for the messages to even transcribe. I mean... what happened. If I have to use the vm that came with this phone then I might as well delete this app."

            "Ok, let's redo this. First of all this is My favorite TMNT series, so that's a big plus! Really easy to get 5 star characters, all you have to do is sim levels for like a month, don't spend \"Green Backs\" on anything but level refreshes and more \" Warp Passes\". The gameplay is a lot of fun and there is no meta! You can pretty much build a team with your favorite characters and turn out just fine! My only wish is that they add the new show in so it will last longer! *Even if I don't like the show!",
            "23 months in. Super fun! I like it a lot! Great depth! Wish it could be played offline, or there was an option to buy it as a stand alone for when it becomes unpopular, and no longer supported. I feel like it is a huge waste in that respect. Game is 5 Stars+!! Fact that all the time and money spent will be obsolete eventually...sad...but, the only game that cannot be played offline I ever got into, because it is fun! Special event \"graphic violence\" feeze not allowing to progress.",
            "Givin 3 stars for the following reasons:- 1. The warm-up meter to fight is unfair. You could be the same level, or even a higher lever, yet the Enemy can have up to 3 attacks before you're even able to fight. Which means they can down 1, severely lower the HP of several or heal themself massively. 2. As much as it's fun, it's a very slow progessing game. You have to go back and forth with each older level to level up, the XP is rather low in numbers. Can't say more because of word limit.",
            "Could easily deserve more stars. This is a fun game. But i feel as you progress its not a smooth gradual progression. Levels seem to go from easy to impossible in a single stage. Daily quest is perfect example of this. Also at the begining you can level up at a steady pace. Seems at 10 it practically comes to a hault. Unless the intention here is to only attract short term players id say things such as this need to change. Deleted. Bye for now. Maybe ill give it another go down the road.",
            "Great game. But yall missing alot of characters from the show. Like hamato yoshi original. Oroku saki original. Crab shrimp and lobster shredder. Wyrm. The speed demon car season 3. Mona Lisa. Mozar. Zeno .Bishop. krang subprime. Krang prime. Among many other that you need. And if yall throwing in the movie characters might as well throw in the 2003 show characters just saying get permission or something. Would make this game better for me. Might even throw money at it"

            "Useless. GPS tracking does not work, tried everything, app usually gets stuck on loading, the features are not user friendly, very limited, very clunky. It's a really slow, limited and badly designed app with inadequate features .",
            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",
            "Can't even log in. It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later. And i could not even log into the app to change for fix anything. And the whole program does not work or link at all with my other son's ipad.",
            "I'm not very happy that Norton does not provide coverage for Microsoft Explorer. Also if you add a website to the unblocked list they are not unblocked immediately. They have a few kinks to work out for me."

After entering a site gotta go back and redue the process all over again. I don't know why this has been given so many stars ether it was useful after so many upgrades or someone likes given good ratings to crappy apps just too make other people mad.",
            "This app is really very amazing. Awesome, It cleans the whole phone in few seconds. I have never seen a phone cleaner like this. But there is very small problem and that is ads , we cannot do anything about ads. Nowadays every app contain ads. To remove ads we have to pay money 😭😭😭. Overall this app is the best phone cleaner. I have one small request to remove ads from this app👍.",
            "I like the app, but when using it advertisement pop up and if my phone rings app will not release the screen so I can answer the call. I watch most of the adds but I don't like anything that takes o Dr my phone. This may cause me to delete app again!! Just checked something today,the app has a cach cleaner. After I cleaned cach with your app, I went and checked cach on each and every app on my phone and had to clear them myself!",
            "Good app. But the ads are pretty annoying and if you want to remove them you need to pay real money for it . Wish there was an app with no ads no more annoying things . But aleast it's a pretty cool app , it can boost your phone in a second if you're phone lags so much . It will junk all the useless stuff in your phone which makes the phone cleaner. I recommend you guys to download the app",
            "This app is the best it made my phone to stop hanging and now I can use my phone without the worry of it crashing 😉 I really hope they prosper and more apps that are better than this. That's my reason for giving it five stars 😁."

            "i love this app, i wish i would've found it right after giving birth. but I am glad I found it better late than never, it is worth the price. it tailors the workout pertianing to your delivery, i would recommend it to anyone, best app ever!",

            "Used to be my favorite media player app on all devices, but no more. PC version is still great, but the Android version can no longer log into my samba server. It did not work great, I had to quit and restart ever so often to re-access folders, but at least this workaround existed. Now this (for me) most essential feature is broken. Now I use MX Player for my smb needs. That works ok, but MX Player does not support casting to Chromecast anywhere near as well as VLC used to.",
            "Prior to the current update, this app was 5 stars. Every part of it was magnificent and truly revolutionary. A free all encompassing media player with a built in preamp, no ads being shoved down your throat, and a beautiful interface. However, the current update removes the latter, making it look like a Facebook clone, as well as adds significant slowdowns and lag spikes. At times, I have to wait 10-15 seconds for my song to play, an \"instantaneous\" action. The prior was better, but still fine.",
            "was the best app for my audio files. started \"parsing media\" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media player😟 Update 10/25/2020: reinstalled this app on my new phone, and it worked great! . . . Until it was updated. Then it lost most of my files, and I had to uninstall it. Again. It seems like this app is either 5 stars or 1 star depending on the updates, so I'm going to give it 3 stars for average.",
            "Before current update, was 5-star. Now it's incredibly buggy. Biggest problems I've encountered is that media continues to play when app is closed, and random album art assigned to any audio files without existing art. The former is especially irritating. New interface is also much more awkward. Looking for a new media player.",
            "I have used VLC for more than ten years -- on Macs, PCs, Linux, and Android. Beginning with this version, I can no longer manually load subtitles, which makes the app unusable on my Android devices. I am currently working on removing it from my tablet and manually installing an older version. Sorry, but this has gone from being the best media player on the planet, to becoming a major fail."

She also said to cancel the booking and gave assurance that new expert would be alotted for the required slot. When I do that, the slots are shown booked. Why do they accept the requests if they are not available only. It was such a headache for me because I had to go somewhere in the evening and all other salons were fully booked for that day. Frst nd last experience.👎",
            "Used app for first time, horrible experience. Person didn't had understanding of work assigned. broke my new lock and make shift arrangements were done which broke within one month. on contacting housejoy, no help was provided.",
            "It is not giving an option of typing my address manually. The App detects my location correctly but the address that it generates based on my GPS is not correct.. It shows 3 houses far away house-no. I tried to edit the house-no with the floor-no but not able to do it as it is allowing to set my address only via GPS. Allow users to manually type their address as well because at times the manual entry is more accurate than GPS generated house address.",
            "Waste app.. While booking any serive they will show small amount and the techinican who visits your home will ask 4-5 times higher amount which is shown while booking... If you complain about that also there will not be any response from Housejoy.. For just saying there is a problem in AC stabiliser technician charged 900/- and after he lefts I got a message that the charges for the service is 143/- means he as taken 5 times high amount regarding which I have complained for more than 6 times."

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "😄✵ I really have enjoyed this app on all of my devices. ❈ It's fun to personalize & make your own. ✿ I have used it since it was able to be installed with no upsets. ✬ I've tried other, similar apps that boast more options, but have always uninstalled them to come right back to the tried & true of this one. ❋ I like that they have several options for set-up. ❁ The most fun is in designing my keyboard & background. ❈ I do wish there was an upside down smiley emoji, my personal favorite! ✺ 💥🌞",
            "I love this keyboard, however, when I swipe a word (\"left\" or \"right\") for example, it corrects it to ← and →. This is FRUSTRATING. This keyboard lives around emojis, but km so tired of having to correct myself because of these things. And there's no setting to turn it off! Would give 5 stars, but this feature is a big setback for the keyboard",
            "Making me restart & unlock my phone BEFORE i can use the app... Um, no. Other DEVS are using the 'copy paste' method2 design their apps, skipping \"permission 2 collect data, card #'s, etc\" 1 suggestion.. W/cyber security on the rise & \"The Laws\" being so lax when it comes to white collar crimes, I suggest ya'll Devs figure it out or ask THOSE DEVS.. Bc by Xmas this yr, evry1 will be less trusting.. I had MY #'s stolen after 72 hrs of punching the #'s into an app. The new gateway 2 ID theft=apps!",
            "Its pretty fun. I actually like this app. more than 5 stars that ill rate but it only have 5 stars... now lets get back... its awesome it has many Emoji's and its gifts... thnx for this app... and thank u too for the some people wo made this app... pretty awesome... hey u... yes u... u should install this app... it has many emojis and costumes... love this app...",
            "Come on guys, really? There's no option to turn off converting my words into emojis? I know the app is built on emojis and that's a good thing if you're all about the emojis... but you have an option to turn off everything else! I type fast. I'm not going back into every sentence to turn symbols into words when they should be words in the first place and I've already done the work. This is still the best keyboard app I've found, but this new feature is really pushing it. It needs a toggle ASAP."

            "It's a very nice game and I enjoy it very much, I would have given it five stars but the problem is the fuel runs out very fast and also the passengers and the roads are the same please work on that it's really boring carrying the same passengers through the same roads, and also the view keeps changing itself every time I reload on fuel or when I pick up the passengers. Either than that it's really a good game 😘😍😘😍😘",

This game is one of the most annoying games I have ever come across. This game seems to be a very interesting game but when I try to play, it starts to fool. Please do something about it because I cannot just waste my bundle to achieve nothing. I'm very bored today because of this game.",
            "The game is good but not so good. When we this game the graphics and background are merging and the people in the game they are also merge with each other and their is no so long and hard level but when we go to full the tank of petrol we have to give some many money 💰. I don't like this game very much. I will give only 2stars Thank you!",
            "From all rickshaw game this is the best game as campare to other Rickshaw game. I like this game. Just one thing there is problem that when you win all the levels there is no things to do with this game and you have to unistall this game. So I want to give some improvement that if you make the endless game then it's good and also improve your graphics. Graphics are not good",
            "The petrol gets finished very soon. And the driver says the same line \" I Come as soon as possible\" and I noticed that the auto do not have the excess to airport , garage , railway stations etc. And another thing I Noticed that the game is different from the pics given in the discription . But I liked the multiplayer mode."

Second issue: as I reviewed the details on the videos and then a group of photos, I noticed that the Time stamp was wrong on every single one of them. I reviewed the Date & Time setting on the phone itself and it is set correctly yet photos I know were taken in the morning are timestamped hours later. Nothing online to fix it.",
            "Wow! I've never seen an app get this much negative feedback! I took a few minutes and read several comments and it's quite clear this app is broken. The cameras in these Moto E5's do work but you will need to download a working camera app because once again this app is broken!!! It took me only a couple of minutes to figure it out I wonder what's up with the clowns at Motorola! I'm not a cell phone or software expert I'm just a guy who can read and understands what he has read. Fix your app Moto",
            "App gives camera error every time and does not save photos any longer. UPDATE: Found that having a 64GB micro SD card formatted as internal storage was what was causing the problem. Switched to 32GB and now use it as external and app works. (had been working for nearly three years the other way) Must have been an update to the phone when I wasn't looking. Maybe the E4 was just too good for the price they charged and they had to downgrade the phone. Upgrading review to five stars.",
            "Worked fine for many years. New update makes the app unstable. Frequently crashes on start. Randomly crashes during use. I suppose this is modern software for ya. Fix what ain't broke. Changes nobody asked for including UI - consistency out the window. Push things out the door as fast and cheap as possible - quality out the window. Updates that make an already trivial program require even more fantastically powerful devices to run... Your streaming pixel data to blit to the screen... Come-on!!!"

            "This is by far the best dj app on gplay. You can create your own playlist and auto or manually mix your tracks. You can also use sound effects and samples to spice up your party or personal mixes. This app is perfect for house parties or college hangouts. You also have the option to use advance sound engine which enables pitch, EQ, Vinyl scratch, and sound effects.The only issue i have with it is that all the sound effects are stuck on preset, it wont allow you to add your own sound effects.",
