            "This app may turn out very usefull in the near future. But it requires a lot of bug fixes. Like for example, when I import a scanned documents and the code converts it from text to speech, there generally are changes I want to make in the text I imported. Hence, when I change the text the app is still reading out the unedited text. That needs to be fixed. But overall, this app is great but needs a lot of changes and improvements. Looking forward for a better version of this soon.",
            "Ooooh my gosh, this needs a lot of work but it's already being promoted mindlessly in YouTube. Import does not support common eBook formats. You cannot select any TTS you download from other sources. Interface is too barebones. The only interesting feature is the automatic reading speed increase, but that is a paid feature. 50 bucks per year? Doesn't worth it for me guys, YET. I'm sticking with the app called @Voice. Great potential. Oh and I forgot that the notification bar is useless.",
            "I know it's in Beta, if they do fix the bugs I will change my review, so the app does not work perfectly, the voices are the same as you get from other places, I sometimes use Google Assistant which just does sound better, the camera does not load, importing links sometimes works and sometimes does not, and I noticed that I used my Google Assistant to do a certain task, and they Speechify continued out of no where to resume it's playing. I really want this app to work, I hope you fix the bugs!! Would recommend for now checking out the Chrome Extension, that works just fine!",
            "This app is useful, but it still has some stuff to fix. I decided to sign up for the free trial, and the premium voices did not load for me. Tried reinstalling the app, but that didn't work. Besides, it does not seem to be able to import Pocket lists, even though it's offered as a feature. This app sounds very promising, hope you can get it to work 100%. It's good but can be better.",
            "Unfortunately, the android version does not have the same features as the ios counterpart. For instance, I cannot listen to all items of a list with a single keypress. I need to open all of them individually, which makes the app essentially worthless for hands-free usage."

It‚Äôs combining music with spelling, music played in the left ear and spelling in\r\nthe right ear. The spelling words progress in difficulty per lesson starting with 3 letter\r\nwords, to 4 letter words. Then advancing to 2 syllable words and then and two words\r\nthat typically go together. Sentences follow with progression of difficulty as well\r\ncorresponding to phonics lessons in the Step By Step Reading program.\r\nThis is a multi sensory approach to teaching and learning phonics using music and is\r\nbased on neuroscience of the relationship of music to learning. The app is an optional\r\ncomponent to the Step By Step Reading program created by Dr. Marianne Cintron. You\r\nmay contact Dr. Cintron on her website: https://www.stepbystepdyslexiasolutions.com.\r\nThis app requires internet connection and is divided into three subgroups. It is designed\r\nfor families. Parents download the app for 7 years or older. Music is always played in\r\nthe LEFT ear and spelling exercises (if desired) in the RIGHT ear. The music itself is\r\ngreat for listening and impacts the brain in beneficial ways.\r\nFor each button, students tap the button to begin the exercise, which can be\r\npaused, rewound, or fast forwarded as the student desires using the back, pause,\r\nand forward arrows < = >.\r\nSubgroup 1a: There are two basic exercises at the top, that when tapped, will begin.\r\nExercise 1 contains music only, to be played in the LEFT ear via ear pod, allowing the\r\nstudent to listen while focusing on reading the phonics or completing workbook pages.\r\nExercise 2 is letter names and sound for students at any age who need that support.\r\nSubgroup 2: There are 28 spelling exercises that correspond to the Step By Step\r\nReading program. Students listen with ear pods so that music is played in the LEFT ear\r\nwhile the spelling exercises are listened to in the RIGHT ear.\r\nSubgroup 3: There are 8 spelling sentence groups that correspond to the Step-By Step\r\nReading program. Students listen with ear pods so that music is played in the LEFT ear\r\nwhile the spelling exercises are listened to in the RIGHT ear.\r\nPage 2\r\nWhy This App Is Unique\r\nMUSIC IS USED TO HELP WITH READING, SPELLING, WRITING AND SPEAKING!\r\n\r\nDr. Cintron‚Äôs Step By Step Reading program was created with the dyslexic student in\r\nmind in order to use the music.

It‚Äôs combining music with spelling, music played in the left ear and spelling in<br>the right ear. The spelling words progress in difficulty per lesson starting with 3 letter<br>words, to 4 letter words. Then advancing to 2 syllable words and then and two words<br>that typically go together. Sentences follow with progression of difficulty as well<br>corresponding to phonics lessons in the Step By Step Reading program.<br>This is a multi sensory approach to teaching and learning phonics using music and is<br>based on neuroscience of the relationship of music to learning.

It is designed<br>for families. Parents download the app for 7 years or older. Music is always played in<br>the LEFT ear and spelling exercises (if desired) in the RIGHT ear. The music itself is<br>great for listening and impacts the brain in beneficial ways.<br>For each button, students tap the button to begin the exercise, which can be<br>paused, rewound, or fast forwarded as the student desires using the back, pause,<br>and forward arrows &lt; = &gt;.<br>Subgroup 1a: There are two basic exercises at the top, that when tapped, will begin.<br>Exercise 1 contains music only, to be played in the LEFT ear via ear pod, allowing the<br>student to listen while focusing on reading the phonics or completing workbook pages.<br>Exercise 2 is letter names and sound for students at any age who need that support.<br>Subgroup 2: There are 28 spelling exercises that correspond to the Step By Step<br>Reading program. Students listen with ear pods so that music is played in the LEFT ear<br>while the spelling exercises are listened to in the RIGHT ear.<br>Subgroup 3: There are 8 spelling sentence groups that correspond to the Step-By Step<br>Reading program. Students listen with ear pods so that music is played in the LEFT ear<br>while the spelling exercises are listened to in the RIGHT ear.<br>Page 2<br>Why This App Is Unique<br>MUSIC IS USED TO HELP WITH READING, SPELLING, WRITING AND SPEAKING!<br><br>Dr. Cintron‚Äôs Step By Step Reading program was created with the dyslexic student in<br>mind in order to use the music.

I'm amazed that this function isn't built into Android. The app would be improved if there was a way of only having the tint working in certain apps. For example whilst reading email it is excellent, however when looking at photographs I need to turn tint off.",

It enables you to choose the color, transparency of the color, and the size of the colored overlay on your device screen. It also provides a line to help keep your place with reading. However, I have two suggestions - the line needs to be easier to place/move on the page and PLEASE MAKE THIS APP AVAILABLE FOR iPhones. There is nothing like it for apple users and people really need it!",

I have difficulty in saying words I'm trying to spell. There are several other points this app could improve on. 1) to be able to save the words once spelled to keep in a library. 2) to copy and paste. 3) to have better voice recognition to deal with dyspraxia .

        "description": "This app is a must-try for parents, teachers, and tutors who teach reading to students of any age. It is also excellent for self-study to improve reading and English pronunciation.\r\n\r\nUltimate Phonics is useful in any situation where reading is taught:\r\n\r\n* Beginning Readers\r\n\r\nDid you know that many children never become good readers? Reading is the most important skill for education and success. If you have young children first learning to read, you can give them the gift that lasts a lifetime by teaching them with Ultimate Phonics. Just an hour per week can make a huge improvement in their reading ability.\r\n\r\n* Struggling Readers\r\n\r\nDo you have children or students who guess and skip when they read? Did you know that word guessing causes poor reading comprehension and terrible spelling? Relying on word guessing prevents students from becoming good readers and cripples their education.\r\n\r\nA good reader reads by rapidly and accurately sounding out new words. That is exactly what Ultimate Phonics teaches. It develops your students into more accurate, fluent readers with good reading comprehension.\r\n\r\n* Dyslexia and Orton-Gillingham\r\n\r\nUltimate Phonics is very effective for teaching dyslexics to read. The app can be used either by itself or as a supplement for Orton-Gillingham programs or other programs designed to overcome dyslexia.\r\n\r\nIf you are an Orton-Gillingham teacher, you will love this app. It has excellent word lists and decodable sentences, all broken down and sounded out. The app also has a Find feature that lets you look up lessons matching any phonogram in a matter of seconds. This app is a great supplement to any Orton-Gillingham program and is guaranteed to become a useful tool in your teaching toolkit.\r\n\r\n* Adult Literacy\r\n\r\nAdult learners love the design of the program because it teaches them to read clearly and directly, without insulting them. And tutors love Ultimate Phonics because it's easy to use and produces great results. Try it for yourself and see why Ultimate Phonics is an essential teaching tool for any adult literacy situation.\r\n\r\n* ESL and English Pronunciation\r\n\r\nESL (English as a Second Language) students need to learn to read English at the same time they are learning to speak it. Ultimate Phonics effectively improves reading, spelling, and pronunciation for ESL students of all ages.\r\n\r\nIf you are a student learning English, you can use Ultimate Phonics to help with both your reading and your pronunciation. The app breaks down thousands of words and sentences by their individual speech sounds, so you learn in detail how to pronounce words more accurately.\r\n\r\n*** CONTENT\r\n\r\nThe complete program consists of more than 4,400 words and 2,100 sentences organized into 262 lessons. The lessons are grouped into 12 levels, teaching the entire phonics system of English.\r\n\r\nYou get the first level (lessons 1 to 50) for free. You have the option of purchasing additional levels one at a time or purchasing all the levels at once at a discount.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the topics in each level:\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 1 (Lessons 1 to 50)\r\nSimple words with short vowels, single consonants, and consonant blends.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 2 (Lessons 51 to 80)\r\nConsonant digraphs (sh, ch, th, wh, ck), qu, x, ng and nk patterns, and doubled consonants.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 3 (Lessons 81 to 106)\r\nVowel digraphs (ee, ea, oo, ai, ay, oa, ou, ow, aw, au, oy, oi).\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 4 (Lessons 107 to 124)\r\nEndings (s, es, ed, ing, ful), apostrophes and more.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 5 (Lessons 125 to 147)\r\nSyllables, compound words, and multi-syllable words.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 6 (Lessons 148 to 155)\r\nSoft c and g patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 7 (Lessons 156 to 171)\r\nLong vowels in magic e syllables.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 8 (Lessons 172 to 183)\r\nLong vowels in open syllables.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 9 (Lessons 184 to 209)\r\n22 more long vowel patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 10 (Lessons 210 to 225)\r\nR-controlled vowels (ar, er, ir, or, ur, and more).\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 11 (Lessons 226 to 239)\r\n13 more short vowel patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 12 (Lessons 240 to 262)\r\nSilent letters and advanced patterns.",

            "This app contains the material needed to teach reading. It has the sound, words and sentences. However, I think the full app possibly has too many lessons, as it tries to teach nearly every possible combination of letters that make a sound. Also, it is very dry. It is like a text book. For these same reasons, I think it would work quite well with an adult or older child who wants to learn to read. The trial version is free, though, so go ahead and try it.",
            "Amazing app to learn phonics! I use the desktop app in class/via Zoom lessons (it was a life-saver during pandemic!) with my students. They download the app to practice at home (first 50 lessons on phone/tablet-based app are free). It's hard to practice phonics solo if you can't check for correct pronunciation. This way, students immediately discover if they read a word correctly. Eliminates frustration, reinforces their efforts and builds in success! They love it. Great tech support too!",
            "I stop working on my reading in 2017 but this is a great app are perfect to teach reading *****5 I meant the app at the Read LITERALLY COUNCIL in Birmingham Alabama between the year of 2014&2016 and now I own the phone app now Lessons 1-260 if I new about the app years ago I would have been reading by now",

With the sample text I was able to read at probably 1.5√ó, if not more, speedily than had it been in black.

I would change it like another review said by making it into a android theme or something like that. I gave it 4 our of 5 stars because my keyboard lags when I type on the app and so does my autocorrect.",
            "Update. It was perfect with the color.it help me alot. But when ther is a longer note and its opened it's on the bottom and when im trying to go up to the top it goes back to the bottom and the keyboard is out. And it don't always save the notes either. Now it doesn't work to do space when writing"

So much bigger that that's all that's available on the screen, and it won't scroll, and the back button doesn't work. Your only option is to close the app, which means you lost any changes you made.

            "Absolutely frustrating every time I use it I faff around with it for about 10 minutes to get it to actually work instead of reading buttons and URLS and then it will either crash/freeze my computer. If you'e been recommended this because of you're AD(H)D I would not recommend, all it will do is demotivate and frustrate you that you will not get any work done. Funnily enough this is the most productive the app has made me since installing it. I've fiddled around with settings, youtube tutorials and it is still as disappointing and painful since opening it.",
            "Cannot get the app to work. Keyboard keeps crashing so unable to use the app at all. No support found online either which is a shame as it would be useful to have on my tablet.",
            "Its installed I opened a google chrome page assuming that this extension would be in the available at the top of the page, but I don't see it. I can't figure out howbto retrieve it. Also the apps keyboard doenst have good auto spell, it very easy to type typos, and the keys vibrate when you type which is annoying.",
            "App does not respond ,which inturn causes my keybord to malfunction since you control it through the keyboard. Sadily it costs money and the app is useless if this is not addressed.",
            "It does not work on my tablet. Whenever I open the app it goes to the writing option screen.... and that's it. So it's a waste of time and money since I'm paying for it out of my tuition."

Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, \"sounding out\" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads. Often these difficulties are first noticed at school. When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as alexia. The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn. Dyslexia is believed to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood as the result of a traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.",

Its very easy to use and gives you direct straightforward questions and answers. You will never regret downloading it. I highly recommend this app to anyone who needs it. Its a very useful and helpful app tool. It'll give you a more a positive view of yourself and of your mental state. A hugh thankyou to the creators, especially for allowing it free",
            "Was diagnosed by a mental health professional before & this apps tests results were right on which, for such complicated issues, was very surprising. It's a great start for someone who is wanting to know these things",

The results, advice and resources are kept simple and to the point! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED app! I always inform friends or acquaintance of this awesome app!",
            "I have shared it with friends already. It's great. Retake tests compare the results to each one. Keeps a journal. Very handy and if your just starting to seek medical help it can also help them having a result history to look at. Would like it to have an overall test with X amount of questions from all tests to better narrow down to few results. Or option to take actual medical professional tests.",

            "Hello, I love the application, I have had it for a long time and it has never let me down. But just today I found out that it no longer has support for tablets, hopefully you can reconsider that, because the truth is that on a tablet you enjoy the app much more. my son and I read a lot with her, greetings and keep doing wonderful things",
            "This WAS an awesome app and my 1st grader was getting much better at her reading skills. Wish I had found it sooner, as after only having it for a few weeks Google eliminated it without an immediate replacement. They were quite upset when she found out the app no longer worked. It was a 5 star app for her!",
            "We all want riviet back! I was so happy reading all of those books but then it shut down and is no longer available in mobile and is now Google Assistant!If only I did not accidentally deleted it,IM SO SAD MAKE RIVIET COME BACK!its so good for my 1st Grader to read it's helping her read and spell! It was a fully stared game for my child Suzie!",
            "I loved this app it really help but it moved to google assistant, which is really annoying cause my child loved this app this was her only app she was glued to it.so please try and fix this cause this is a good educational app."

I shall probably invest in the VIP features as these seem good value and it's always encouraging to track your progress over time. As a musician I know that practise makes perfect. üòè",
            "This game is great! I use it mostly every day. And I have notice how much it has helped me already! Its fun but yet educational and you don't even realize how much knowledge you obtain from the short everyday challenges. It has helped me in many ways already! Highly recommend to use daily or at least 3-4 times a week upon downloading. Enjoy!!",
            "It's good but some of the games I can't play. If your colour blind like me and you have to discover what violet looks like. The only way i can do it is to eliminate the ones i can see first and hopefully they will be the last ones. I turned on colour blind mode but I don't know if it worked. It wasnt black and white. Some of the colours were invisible to me.",

I have been telling people (for years) that playing brain games can help stave off (their own or a loved one's) Alzheimer's and dementia. Now that I'm pushing 50 I'm taking my own advice-this app is perfect for it! Not only are the games fun, you can work targeted areas, track your progress, and see what percentile you are in.ü§ò",

            "This isn't a complete app for average people, I don't think more than 80% of people who have downloaded this would understand this app. 1. The instructions are only partial and doesn't indicate that the text will be of 15 minutes, You would have to read \"About app\" for that. 2. What the hell those figures even mean? No matter if the figures are accurate or not they do not even remark about ones performance in the test which feels like you have wasted all your time. Can be made a lot better.",
            "Tap the screen except when you see the letter \"?\"... The next button covers the letter im supposed to be looking for so I cant read the full instructions. Very frustrating.",
            "Silly app, it's meant to be testing you on your ability to react to a letter but the actual letter is hidden under UI so you don't know what it is. Basic error really.",
            "Good Start! Nice Test with option to control sound and vibration Can you please add the following: 1. Option for test duration say 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, etc 2. Option for speed or interval between two letters 3. Can the reports be only in English. One worksheet can give explanation which will help the users to choose the right metric. Also user info not avbl in attachment is it because I clicked on Test. You may like to see the SART app on i-phone All the best",
            "Interesting, but could be better if the app gave some indication of what the results meant. It's dissapointing to have done the test for what felt like no reason. It's hard to tell how your performance is in relation to other people's. The test could say things like if you're average, above average or below average. Or it could give some indication of the chances of you having ADHD (I myself am being tested tomorrow)."

I don't know if English is the first language for this developer, so some help there is warranted. But with some polish and links to other sites to shore up his statements and back up information, it's a great start.",

            "This app is lacking in many areas, when translated to English it has many \ngrammatical errors, also, no links to app referrals, no introduction to \nanchoring and lack of explanation in so many areas. For instance there is a \nsection called, \"All sorts of pills\", yet only three of them are mentioned. \nThe tests are not true diagnostic tools and should be introduced that way. \nIt feels like the creator was in a hurry and just wanted it done. Given \ntime and information, this app could be a very good resource."

So of course I said 2 thinking Peter and John were the names of the twins but then in the answer it said 4 people lived here saying the twins AND Peter and John. I think someone needs to go back and double check the answers as it could be very confusing for children.",

            "This isn't a complete app for average people, I don't think more than 80% of people who have downloaded this would understand this app. 1. The instructions are only partial and doesn't indicate that the text will be of 15 minutes, You would have to read \"About app\" for that. 2. What the hell those figures even mean? No matter if the figures are accurate or not they do not even remark about ones performance in the test which feels like you have wasted all your time. Can be made a lot better.",
            "Tap the screen except when you see the letter \"?\"... The next button covers the letter im supposed to be looking for so I cant read the full instructions. Very frustrating.",
            "Silly app, it's meant to be testing you on your ability to react to a letter but the actual letter is hidden under UI so you don't know what it is. Basic error really.",
            "Good Start! Nice Test with option to control sound and vibration Can you please add the following: 1. Option for test duration say 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, etc 2. Option for speed or interval between two letters 3. Can the reports be only in English. One worksheet can give explanation which will help the users to choose the right metric. Also user info not avbl in attachment is it because I clicked on Test. You may like to see the SART app on i-phone All the best",
            "Interesting, but could be better if the app gave some indication of what the results meant. It's dissapointing to have done the test for what felt like no reason. It's hard to tell how your performance is in relation to other people's. The test could say things like if you're average, above average or below average. Or it could give some indication of the chances of you having ADHD (I myself am being tested tomorrow)."

            "This app in my opinion, is terrible. The keyboard is slow and makes you have mistakes. And the fact that you have to get premium to get better grammar fixtures is just terrible. I don't recommend you use this app, on mobile.",
            "I purchased the premium app and the download refused to work. I have tried many times, but it is defective. The response team at Grammarly is terrible. You can only reach an automated system and it asks for the same information again and again. They have terrible customer relations. I will never use them again, .I wasted my $140 and they refuse to acknowledge my purchase even with a receipt from paypal.",
            "The grammar checking is pretty good and the keyboard is decent, but both are too slow. I'm also not sure that grammar checking fits well inside a keyboard. It should be a separate app, sort of like Proofreader. That way I can use whatever keyboard I want and whatever grammar checker I want without having to find one app that's amazing at both. Do one thing and do it well.",
            "I just downloaded it and it was working well for a good amount of time but after some hours, when I was checking grammar with it, I was having lots of problems. Like for example, I forgot to put comma after a word which was necessary but when it corrected the sentence, a letter missed out. Same happened next time. It's really frustrating, fix this problem please. Otherwise it's a good app",
            "This app is not ready for prime time. I thought it was a great idea, but the keyboard puts more errors than it removes. To put a space between letters you need a hammer for the keyboard. My standard Samsung keyboard is much better in that aspect. And many of the simple mistakes that I make the app never corrected them. If they fix these problem, it might be worth the effort. But given that it takes away a row of keys (the dedicated numeric keys), no so good."

            "Good apps with lots of \"premium voice\" and great looking ui. But the cons is: 1. They don't support web reading unlike @Voice. 2. If you using pdf better use moon reader, they have simplified mode and night mode also they bookmark your pdf or book folder (no sign up) and of course they can use text to speech as well. 3. They don't have search feature or favourite for the voice so good luck searching it. The pros probably 1. They can use cloud, 2. They can use ocr (paid). 3. Lots of voice (paid)",
            "Love the app. It's really good for slow readers like me. Can you guys please add folders for adding custom books you own so you can read them? I also love the CC feature as well. I have bad reading comprehension and a intellectual learning disability so I have a hard time learning. It's really hard trying to find a app like this. It's a good app if anyone has a learning disability who struggles. If I take a picture of a Japanese light novel book in English that I bought will ORC pick it up?",

Today i had a problem with it playing my document at all even after i restarted the app. I uninstalled and reinstalled only to find out the entire app was updated and now is a monthly subscription. Im not where i can afford that atm and Im a sad that I didnt realise it before i uninstalled. I prefer one time pymnts. The new version says there is a free version but it wont work on my phone.",

It also separates the page so it reads parts separately that aren't meant to be separate. Besides that it's great for auditory listeners with school and learning. Just reading in general its helpful for processing what its saying.",

My son is able to learn more advance subjects by changing the age. The best part is that there are ABSOLUTELY NO ADS and it is free!!! I highly recommend this to all parents.",
            "I am absolutely in LOVE with this app! It has the best learning material and no ads. Perfect!! I was looking for something educational for my 7 and 4 year old, and this is the only one I will ever use for them. It's perfect. Seriously deleting all other learning apps and games because this is the only one they will ever need. I can't believe it's completely free and no ads. Thank you so much for making this amazing app free for my children and helping them learn. I am so greatful!!!",
            "My little niece loves it! Everything is VERY clear, easy to understand, fun and really helps keep their attn while learning! NO ADS and NEVER boring!! Can't believe this is a FREE APP!!! KAK doesn't give kids the answers, they have to actually figure things out (and learn), which is wonderful! The fun (sometimes silly) songs and educational stories are great!! There's constant positive reinforcement, throughout. If they get an answer wrong, they're encouraged to keep trying. EXCELLENT APP üëå!!",
            "We love this app! It's one of my son's favorite things to do on his new tablet. He calls it his \"learning\". I do wish you could track progress through the regular Khan Academy (as he has an account there), and there's definitely a need for more to do offline. We like to use this in the car or while we are out for very long periods of time, but he is getting bored with the small bits he can do offline. Otherwise, this is a really great app, overall.",
            "Picky 4 and 6 year old enjoyed the challenges. Most of the time, I have to remind them to try the apps but not this one‚Äîthey voluntarily uses it. The user interface of the app of a thumbs up too. It's easier for parents to find a subject and see which topics from their list hasn't been opened yet because it shows a check sign once you're done with a certain topic."

            "I'm in the middle of a book series called Stalking Jack the Ripper,but the app cuts the series short, (even young adults like to read too) if the app wasn't vital, I'd look so where else to read. I also can't stand when I'm listening to an audiotext and the voice changes midway through, so ic really prefer to stay with the current narrator. P.S. if you want better ratings try uploading books like the Stalking Jack the Ripper series for older dyslexia readers.",
            "The service is vital but the app itself is terrible. It's definitely something that if I didn't *need* it so bad I wouldn't use it *because* of the app. The app is glitchy and rereads the same pages over and over, shut off at random times, the pages must be manually turned much of the time or it gets sick/goes back to the page you started on at random intervals (too bad if you didn't know your pg #), it shuts off w/ the screen, and there's no option to control the playback from the lock screen.",
            "Whenever I'm listening to a story and my phone screen times out, it will either reread a section that was pages away or it will just abruptly stop.",
            "Audio playback is buggy. Audio skips back randomly making it frustrating to listen to.",
            "This is a great app and I really recommend it. It has EVERYTHING you need to have a good time reading"

        "description": "Do you know that 80% of learning problems are reading problems? Difficulties, such as dyslexia or hyperlexia, in reading can explain 60% of school failure.\r\n\r\nReadUp by Glifing is the game that improves children's reading and reading comprehension using the Glifing method. It is a method that children with reading difficulties can benefit from, regardless of whether they suffer from dyslexia, reading disorder, ADHD, Down syndrome, specific language disorder, stuttering ..., as well as children who already read well but want to read with more fluidity and ease. In addition, it is a complementary application to those already used by schools to teach reading and to reinforce reading. There are already more than 80,000 children around the world who have managed to improve.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is aimed at children between 6 and 12 years old who are learning to read or who want to improve or perfect their level. Children with 4 or 5 years old who have a knowledge of letters can also play and learn.\r\n\r\nAvailable in Spanish and Catalan.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is divided into reading levels. At the beginning of the game, a level test is carried out on the child to know what their reading level is, this reading level is not linked to the school year, in this way they can learn and improve from their real level.\r\n\r\nWithin a reader level there are islands and each island has 30 missions to complete. In all missions you are accompanied by the Readup dragon. This friendly character is the mascot for the child and provides instructions to the adult or tutor on how to carry out each of the missions.\r\n\r\nA mission brings together all the phases that make up the Glifing method:\r\n\r\n1. Phonological path of reading. Train decoding by reading pseudowords.\r\n2. Lexical path of reading. Train the recognition of frequent words globally.\r\n3. Memory training. Strengthens memory, where the phonological imprint and visual memory are improved.\r\n4. Reading comprehension. It requires understanding in the context of previous mission activities.\r\n\r\nIn each mission you can get up to 3 stars, these are determined according to the successes that have been completed in each of the previous activities.\r\n\r\nFinally, so that the playful part of the game is understood, at the end of the mission, there is a minigame, the objective of which is to feed the dragon, and here you can also obtain gems depending on how well it is done.\r\n\r\nStars and gems can be used to customize the dragon in Readup's Dragon Shop. Therefore, the more you play, the more missions will be completed, and the more fun customizations you can make to the dragon.\r\n\r\nWe believe that parents or guardians are an essential part in the education of children, for this reason, in each mission it is required that the lexical and morphological path activities be carried out jointly with them, that is, it will be the parent or guardian who determines if the child has pronounced the word correctly. When it is not possible to be together, the tutor mode can be disabled and those missions are marked with an exclamation to remember that that part is missing to complete it. We know that there are automatic methods of voice recognition, but we are committed to strengthening the relationship between parents (or guardians) with children.\r\n\r\nGlifing is based on its own method registered under a research project carried out at the UB (University of Barcelona).

            "Great Spelling app. Has learning mode LM & testing mode TM. LM: good for visual/kinetic learners. Shows the spelling of each word at start (& can reshow the word); Has only correct letters to choose from when spelling. TM: harder version. Suggestion: 1) a record of child's progress/%. 2) more than one learning path for more kids 3) needs options eg: USA or UK spelling; number of words in each test; font; group words as families 4) be able to correct own mistakes in LM (particularly last letter)",
            "My three year old loves this game! easy to use, multiple difficulties. I love that it's available offline. We used the free version for a long time, but my kid mastered all the words and was ready for a bigger challenge. Some of the negative reviews are laughable considering my three-year-old can use it without issue. FYI it is in traditional British English, so there are a few minimal spelling and pronunciation variations. For example the way they spell practice with an s instead of c.",
            "I like this app. Our daughter is dyslexic and immediately jumped into the learning and testing which showed her she needed to really pay attention and work to progress. However i don't see scores shown to encourage progress. I would also like the option to have the letters read aloud l (and not) in learning mode.",
            "Your App is great bu there one limitation that is it does not sound when we click on a letter i e while writing PEN it should Pa when we click on Letter P, While clicking on letter E it should sound e, while clicking on letter N it should sould sound na, so that children can learn letter and their joining automatically, with out any external help. I hope you will look into my suggestion.",

            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",

Perhaps with lots of practice, I will begin to adapt to it, and hopefully it will become much clearer (unless the app needs tweaking). I'm giving this 4/5 because it has great potential.",

            "\"Free Trial\" offered ZERO reads, in other words the Trial was actually just a view of the App, like a photo that someone posted. ¬£100 is a lot of money to throw out \"hoping\" the app will work. In summary there are 2 problems so far, the free trial is not a trial, and it is expensive.",
            "Didn't work at all. I heard it was on the braille note touch plus that I'm researching. After Installing it said \"thank you for evaluating\" and asked if I wanted to unlock unlimited. It wouldn't even let me try it to see if it was right for my blind 12yo. None of the buttons did anything and no help available. So much for that program."

        "description": "Try this online questionnaire to find out if adAPT might benefit you or your child:\r\nhttp://www.cadetnm.com/quiz.html\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about the app and its utility to you, please do not hesitate to contact us! \r\nMessage us on facebook:  https://m.me/youcanadapt\r\nE-mail support@cadetnm.com \r\nWebsite: http://www.cadetnm.com ‚Ä®\r\n\r\nWho is it for? \r\nProblems in sound processing are common features of many developmental and learning disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia, and ADHD. For some children and adults, sound hypersensitivities are particularly problematic. Sounds from vacuum cleaners, thunder, crying babies, and other sources may cause extreme discomfort and distraction. adAPT ‚Äì advanced auditory processing training is a music based system for guiding the brain to become a better processor of auditory information. \r\n\r\nHow does it work? \r\nDeveloped by a team of brain scientists, with funding from Cure Autism Now and the National Institutes of Health, adAPT is an educational program that involves listening to specially modulated music. The modulated music is believed to trigger neuroplasticity to re-organize a disordered auditory cortex into a better functioning system. In comparison to Berard Auditory Integration Training (a controversial alternative music based therapy), the music modulation profile for adAPT is explicitly based on over 15 years of neuroscience research by the team of scientists at CADET. Our study indicates that adAPT normalizes aberrant brain activity, reduces sound sensitivities, decreases irritability and behavior problems, and improves general auditory processing. Our on-going research includes the use of advanced brain imaging methods which is available through the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A white paper describing this research is available on our website (www.cadetnm.com). \r\n\r\nWhat is the adAPT program? \r\nadAPT is a 4-week, home-based program implemented as two 30-minute session per day for 5 days per week.

        "descriptionHTML": "Try this online questionnaire to find out if adAPT might benefit you or your child:<br>http://www.cadetnm.com/quiz.html<br><br>If you have any questions about the app and its utility to you, please do not hesitate to contact us! <br>Message us on facebook:  https://m.me/youcanadapt<br>E-mail support@cadetnm.com <br>Website: http://www.cadetnm.com ‚Ä®<br><br>Who is it for? <br>Problems in sound processing are common features of many developmental and learning disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia, and ADHD. For some children and adults, sound hypersensitivities are particularly problematic. Sounds from vacuum cleaners, thunder, crying babies, and other sources may cause extreme discomfort and distraction. adAPT ‚Äì advanced auditory processing training is a music based system for guiding the brain to become a better processor of auditory information. <br><br>How does it work? <br>Developed by a team of brain scientists, with funding from Cure Autism Now and the National Institutes of Health, adAPT is an educational program that involves listening to specially modulated music. The modulated music is believed to trigger neuroplasticity to re-organize a disordered auditory cortex into a better functioning system. In comparison to Berard Auditory Integration Training (a controversial alternative music based therapy), the music modulation profile for adAPT is explicitly based on over 15 years of neuroscience research by the team of scientists at CADET. Our study indicates that adAPT normalizes aberrant brain activity, reduces sound sensitivities, decreases irritability and behavior problems, and improves general auditory processing. Our on-going research includes the use of advanced brain imaging methods which is available through the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A white paper describing this research is available on our website (www.cadetnm.com). <br><br>What is the adAPT program? <br>adAPT is a 4-week, home-based program implemented as two 30-minute session per day for 5 days per week. Specially chosen music is included with the app (no additional purchase required), with modulation and playback completely automated within the app. The music modulation includes narrow and broadband filtering, plus insertion of everyday sounds for habituation. The music intentionally sounds a bit odd, with key characteristics to induce guided cortical re-organization.

        "description": "Visual Attention Therapy helps brain injury and stroke survivors, as well as struggling students, to improve scanning abilities. It also helps rehab professionals to assess for neglect and provide more efficient and effective therapy for attention deficits.\r\n\r\nVisual Attention Therapy Lite gives you a free taste of the customization and utility of the full app: Visual Attention Therapy.

This is also called false advertising so the BBB will know about this.",
            "The app is difficult to manage. There is not a lot of information on the app. The service is very basic compared to competitors. I am trying to figure out what 2 books I received for October and what is coming up for November but it isn't clearly stated anywhere and the last update I received was August 31st. Any other correspondence I have received is promotions.",
            "we keep experiencing freezing, often it will spin for an hour, i emailed a complaint that said there was an up date. where is that? because if you updated it in the app, it didnt work. we have uninstalled and reinstalled it several times and it still freezes when it come to interacting. my son loved it when it worked, but we cannot see how he is gonna learn to read in a frozen screen",
            "My son hates reading. He has struggled because he has trouble with his speech due to a tongue and lip tie - everything sounds different to him than the sounds that he's able to produce. But today, for the first time he read a book without complaint. He only had to sound out one word, and the process was smooth and he was smiling the whole time and I was in tears. He's seven and we decided to start from scratch with him at home to give him the confidence he needs. I am so grateful!!!",
            "My son enjoyed the app so we decided to try the free trial, which is advertised as \"1 month FREE trial\" when you sign up for the monthly subscription in the app. I did that and got my receipt confirming a \"one WEEK\" free trial. I emailed Hooked on Phonics and they said the \"one month for $1\" offer was only through the website and the app is only one week, despite it clearly saying MONTH. Beware of this bait-and-switch and dishonest company."

            "Great concept but Parent Zone needs work. Between the forced use of the in-app keyboard, copy/paste/fill being disabled making a password manager useless, and switching to another app dropping you back to the Home screen, the login experience is horrible. Since the login is not stored, the whole painful process must be repeated every time you click on the Cloud tab. Recorded audio fluctuates randomly. Sharing tests between devices is a manual process so updating tests is painful.",
            "It has amazing graphics and kids at any age can have a nice, relaxing spelling test that any freinds, random kids around the world and family can make and there is also a little boomerang game and thats where you can get better squeebles and better boomerangs! Plus, your squeeble can throw the boomerang and you get more coins for better squeebles and boomerangs and you get coins by completing spelling tests! So it basically encourages your child to do a spelling test! It's a wonderful app!",
            "Great, but access to some of the settings are only available when you set up a child, which is frustrating",
            "Great app. It's really easy to configure new tests and the downloadable ones are very useful. Most importantly, both kids (8 & 5) really like it. Only minor complaint is that the that some of the pre-recorded words on the downloadable tests can be slightly unclear and would benefit from an example of usage.",
            "I have just tried to purchase this on an Android device it has not downloaded on the device that I wanted and you have taken my money.but it seems to be allowing me to download it on my phone device which I do not want it to.

            "I bought this game for my sons, aged 7 and 9, primarily because my oldest son is struggling to learn to read. I was a little concerned because it says it's recommended for kids 8 and under, but skill wise he is behind so that hasn't been a problem. I only found out about the game because I was watching a video in Stanislas Dehaene mentioned it and said it was good. It is absolutely worth every cent. Both my boys find it fun and the graphics are great. They're really engaged and love customising their avatar and buying animals for their scrapbook. I love that both my boys can work at their own pace and level. My son who struggles has naturally fallen a little behind his younger brother, but this isn't a problem because he isn't rushed by the game to keep up. What's more, their levels are displayed anywhere but in the player info (which the kids don't check) so there's no competitiveness. My favourite thing is, if they're struggling at a level, the game doesn't just move them to the next phoneme, nor does it make them replay the same game over and over - which would be boring and disheartening for anyone. They move along the map just as the usually would and choose a new game, but the same phoneme set is used. I can't recommend this game highly enough. It can be tough to pick apps to help your kids but I feel like we've really hit gold with this one.",
            "This is an amazing way for children to learn to spell and read without even knowing. My first grader loves it. I have seen great strides in his reading and spelling skills already just two weeks into using Grapho game.",

Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

So if your left eye is better, you can remember the sequence first, then use you memory to see better same characters for right eye. Also it gives very different scores for different test. Overall considering so many design flows I do not recommend using this app at all.",
            "I feel as if i see much more than test indicates. I can see long distances clearly. I had used my eye drops a few minues prior to the first test. Should i have put on my readers? I would like to communicate with someone to make sure i did the test right.",

            "Fairly accurate except the test to see if your glasses are right for you. It said my glasses were not right for me. I tried the regular test with glasses on and had 100% vision in both eyes which tell me me my glasses are the right strength. Also the test to see if you have a stigmatism isn't right. It said I have a stigmatism in both eyes and my Son got the same result when he has 20/10 vision which is even better than 20/20 vision!"

Comprehension, phonemic awareness, phonics, sequencing, vocabulary, etc. And not only that it has everything but that it makes everything engaging for children. This is my daughter‚Äôs favorite app. The pathway is awesome. If there is a way for me to utilize this in my classroom for my students with a teacher account, please le",
            "I downloaded a monthly subscription of the app, from December 2019- March 2020, costing ¬£7.49. It was ok the first few weeks, but then it started freezing, constantly lagging, audio will play but activity won't show (just stuck on the homer loading screen).Having to close it and restart. I decided to reinstall and renew on the 12th October 2020. However, this time it is priced at ¬£8.99. Still the same issues. My four years old is getting frustrated. I'll cancel once this month is finished.",
            "Very misleading. Might as well just come out and be a price. Don't know why it's in the free section when you literally can't do anything without paying for a subscription. Here's what you can do without paying. Open and close the app... Edit: I see no limited free use option. As stated above since you don't read these. I CAN LITERALLY OPEN AND CLOSE THE APP WITHOUT PAYING. SO IF THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN BY LIMITED FREE PLAY THEN YES I GUESS ITS FUN TO JUST OPEN AND CLOSE THE APP",
            "This app is so robust! My three kids (3 1/2, 2, 2) have autism and two of them love books but one is very easily distracted and he doesn't ant have patience for reading books. I found this app to be a bit of help because we can read along and its amazing graphics and colors makes it really easy to \"get into\".",

        "description": "Includes: English, German, French, Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian, Italian, Turkish, Polish, Danish, Swedish, Bulgarian, Catalan, Georgian, Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, Greek, Romanian\r\n\r\nCan learning to read be as easy and exciting as playing a computer game? We've developed a game with which you can learn to read intuitively and individually, as you would play a game.\r\nWe believe that a learning game has to be so good that it would encourage you to play it even though you might not be interested in its pedagogical content. We've done our best to implement this idea in our game. In doing so, we incorporate psycho-pedagogical foundations and concepts from the Montessori method, improve upon such tools as phonetic charts and present the syllables as they are actually spoken and not as they would be if spoken separately. Our emphasis is not on learning to recite the alphabet or spelling out words; on the contrary, instead of learning the ABC off by heart, the pupil learns which sounds actually occur in each word. As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.\r\n\r\nShould you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org \r\n\r\nThe game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. You hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.",

Finally, about 5 days of investigation, where even with the transaction info...THEY couldn't find the account (which turned out to be my separated partners account on the then, family pc) ...they finally email me to say, the account has been set back up...with my email address. Had to remove PayPal and bank accounts from google/paypal to stop all access.",
            "This app really stinks. When my kid took the placement test, it placed her way out of her abilities. She was asked to parce a paragraph ( she is 5.... She can't even read yet). So she just clicks around until it lets her move on. Since we do this through school, I asked her teacher to reset her level, but she doesn't know how. So she emailed customer support and recieved NO RESPONSE. pretty crazy since you know the school is paying for it. ABC Mouse is way better and way more fun.",
            "My kid likes the app, but it constantly crashes on our Android 9. Fast Phonics, peak 3, as the level goes up, the chance of crashing increases. E.g. it took 4 attempt before finishing level 18 on peak 3. First 3 attempts, the app just crashed and went back to the home screen.",
            "There seems to be a problem using the app on my Samsung tablet - it's working ok on my samsung phone. On the tablet the games where you have to \"flick the letters up\", rather than just click on them, do not work.",
            "Hi. Love this app but have noticed that the app keeps crashing after each level is completed, I then have to close down and restart the app to then carry on to the next level"

It is great in the way that she wants to play the game and laughs at all the videos that goes with the sounds. In addition to her reading struggles she also has problems with writing and she is asked to follow the path to make the letters correctly as well. She doesn't seem to realize that she is learning and playing at the same time. She is already asking if there is a hairy phonics 3 as well.",

            "I know that it takes lots and lots of efforts, commitments in making a quality app and giving it for free is not just an easy thing. I'm teaching my toddlers with these app and they totally love it. They started enjoying learning. For my 2 yrs old kid Lucas has become a good motivator. These apps are far better than some of the paid apps. What you ppl are doing is a great work providing quality learning materials for kids who can't afford it. Keep up the good work. May God bless you all .",
            "My daughter is 4 years old and her preschool teachers have noticed a great advance in her knowledge of words, numbers, shapes,etc. I totally have this app to thank. This app is amazing and fun. She enjoys learning because it's a game for her!! I highly recommend",
            "I love this! My son loved it also. We were searching for free games and no ads and they say that but its almost never true. But this one is I was surprised! Hes getting ready for Kindergarten!!! Thank you for making this possible I didnt think it existed. <3",
            "My ASD non verbal ADHD child absolutely adore this games, I'm inmensely grateful that they're free with no ads. I wish it was multi language, my son understands German and Spanish, and although he likes the game I can tell he can't understand much yet. We have your other games in Spanish and they've helped him so much to learn and try to communicate, but I understand resources are not unlimited for you guys, thank you so much for what you do, wholeheartedly recommend this games to everyone .",
            "The app is very good for children learning to spell, and identifying first sight words. It is especially nice that they only do a few words to learn at a time and they use different games to teach them to kids."

We added  amazing new features in our latest update, including a brand new educational mode called CVC Words. Your child can play five new games that help teach simple consonant-vowel-consonant words, all with fun pictures and cute animals!<br><br>New in this update:<br>- Improved graphics and animations<br>- Added new unlockable rewards",

            "Just what I was looking for so that my child can get comfortable with phonics and sounding out words. I really like how you can customize in several ways, including upper case / lower case, and also in requiring the spelling games to be done left to right. My child enjoys playing the games and the content is solid. The way they do the feedback for positive reinforcement and for mistakes is also really good. I looked at paid games, but this is better. thank you!",
            "I love your apps, and so does my son! He is only 3 (will be 4 in 3 months) and he has all ready learned most of the sounds the letters make and can spell some words. I also love that there are no ads to break his concentration or make him frustrated. I think that makes a big difference. This one is his favorite, but he also loves the others. Thank you for these amazing tools! We deeply appreciate All children deserve programs to learn and grow with for no cost.",
            "This app is a beautiful and wonderful very colourful add with dolphins fishes and even Balloons coming out the water you even get beautiful stickers at the end of a game it is such a beautiful app the children will love it it teaches them different pictures and spelling at the same time I love this app thank you so muchüñïüòÉüåπ‚ù§Ô∏è it's my pleasure we have just played and thoroughly enjoyed the ABC Spelling again and again will carry on enjoying this app thank you so much for your beautiful message",
            "My daughter and I like all the educational RV apps. However, whether it is to teach pronunciation, spelling or recalling the CVC words, the Lettering should have been designed in LOWERCASE to make the lessons more understanding since new preschoolers are initially aware of Lowercase letters to avoid confusion. As they progress, Uppercase will be eventually learnt in their second year of Pre-k.",
            "I love all of these all but only problem is my 1 year old son know how to spell Lucas dan his name because Lucas spell his name all the time there should be a way to edit the name and put the child name so they could learn to spell they name early dan Lucas but I see great results from all there app..continue doing a wonderful job"

            "These apps are really awesome and I'm using them as part of our homeschooling education. The biggest problem is that the voice is too low even with the volume up all the way. So my kids are asking me what a word is so can try to spell it. If the music and voice could be adjusted so you can hear the words, it would be a 5 star app. Personally, I think it's worth it to get the year subscription. Until we explore more, that's my only suggestion at this point. üôÇ",

            "I give it a 3 star because this app is definitely helpful in teaching kids to read, dont get me wrong Both my kids were able to read before they were 3. BUT I just wish i was able to transfer purchases to other tablets. I have 2 sons and I bought the whole $30 package and realised that I couldnt use that package on the other tablet. I'm sorry but that's a little too expensive if you ask me...I guess they will have to switch off. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
            "I'm giving this one star not because my daughter didn't love it because she absolutely did, but because if you want to buy more than just the first five words, you have to buy it on EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF TECH your child uses. There is no account or registration functionality to this app to be able to link the purchase with an account and log in on a new device. My daughter uses 3 different devices occasionally depending on the situation. That's 12.00 for EACH device. That would be 36.00!",
            "It's good so far, but I've paid before & it has me trying to pay again. It also wont go any farther saying waiting to download which I dont understand.",

            "Great app. Just needs some small fixes. -When my boy writes a 9 it thinks its a 4 sometimes. And when he writes 4 it thinks its 21. - The games where you drag numbers or pictures to a location auto snaps it into place if its correct. So my boy has learned to just drag the number around until it auto snaps in, instead of solving the problem.",
            "Absolutely love this app!...amazed at how engaged my daughter is...she honestly thinks shes on some treasure hunt as she goes through the activities. Really excited to see how much my daughters math skills will grow. Shes 4 now and as much as I've tried the idea of simple addition/subtraction just couldnt stick but shes got no problem figuring it out with this app. On top of all of that I had a few issues setting it up on my device but their customer service is excellent. Highly Recommend!",
            "My 6 year old found it fun. It progressively gets more challenging. I wish the instructions were read out loud. The content is good. I wish there was a monthly subscription. $80 for 2 years for an APP is expensive.",

            "It's a shame that this game doesn't give you the coins you win. Played the daily challenge for 30 days and won the 200 coins, yet I didn't get them. Tried to contact them but the have no direct message. There is no use playing if you're going to cheat me out of the winnings. Also need to work on the words. There have been many words that you say no that are.....",
            "Great game which is addictive, I play this all the time because it is simple yet fun. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because there is one improvement which would be good to see in this game; and that would be an option to change colours of the block and background. Having played the game more 100s of times, seeing the same colours does make it dull. If this small update was implemented, it would make a huge difference.",
            "I am giving this a low rating because of all the ads and the fact that you can get rid of them for 4 bucks but thats just for 30 days. Seriously???? Also the landscape never changes even though in the ad it showed green grass which looked cool. Shame on you devs. Where are the levels in the pictures and trailer? It's a great game but it's the same thing over amd over again.",
            "Not what was advertised when It was an ad, I saw ad and was like woah that looks like a fun little game so I downloaded quickly without investigating, only to find this completely different game so for that I give a 1star. But it's a fun game so 5 star. DO NOT LIKE BEING TRICKED HOWEVER. Shame on you if you're in control of false advertising. But a fun game so I'm conflicted.",
            "The music is peace allowing you to think ,no time presure,which allows you to relax,and the background pic is beautiful. No ads intrupt while your trying to think.So if you like block puzzles I highly recommed trying this one."

            "The app is one of the best apps out there but the update has not been great at all. It does not give you an option of the voice you really prefer to listen to. At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

        "description": "This is the full version of the Ultimate Phonics Reading App. It gives you complete access to all 12 levels and 262 lessons and does not require any in-app purchases.\r\n\r\nThis app is a must for parents, teachers, and tutors who teach reading to students of any age. It is also excellent for self-study to improve reading and English pronunciation.\r\n\r\nUltimate Phonics is useful in any situation where reading is taught:\r\n\r\n* Beginning Readers\r\n\r\nReading is the most important skill for education and success. If you have young children first learning to read, you make sure they become excellent readers by teaching them with Ultimate Phonics.\r\n\r\n* Struggling Readers\r\n\r\nDo you have children or students who guess and skip when they read? Did you know that word guessing causes poor reading comprehension and terrible spelling? Relying on word guessing prevents students from becoming good readers and cripples their education.\r\n\r\nA good reader reads by rapidly and accurately sounding out new words. That is exactly what Ultimate Phonics teaches. It develops your students into more accurate, fluent readers with good reading comprehension.\r\n\r\n* Dyslexia and Orton-Gillingham\r\n\r\nUltimate Phonics is very effective for teaching dyslexics to read. The app can be used either by itself or as a supplement for Orton-Gillingham programs or other programs designed to overcome dyslexia.\r\n\r\nIf you are an Orton-Gillingham teacher, you will love this app. It has excellent word lists and decodable sentences, all broken down and sounded out. The app also has a Find feature that lets you look up lessons matching any phonogram in a matter of seconds. This app is a great supplement to any Orton-Gillingham program and is guaranteed to become a useful tool in your teaching toolkit.\r\n\r\n* Adult Literacy\r\n\r\nAdult learners love the design of the program because it teaches them to read clearly and directly, without insulting them. And tutors love Ultimate Phonics because it's easy to use and produces great results. Try it for yourself and see why Ultimate Phonics is an essential teaching tool for any adult literacy situation.\r\n\r\n* ESL and English Pronunciation\r\n\r\nESL (English as a Second Language) students need to learn to read English at the same time they are learning to speak it. Ultimate Phonics effectively improves reading, spelling, and pronunciation for ESL students of all ages.\r\n\r\nIf you are a student learning English, you can use Ultimate Phonics to help with both your reading and your pronunciation. The app breaks down thousands of words and sentences by their individual speech sounds, so you learn how to pronounce words more accurately.\r\n\r\n*** CONTENT\r\n\r\nThe complete program consists of more than 4,400 words and 2,100 sentences organized into 262 lessons. The lessons are grouped into 12 levels, teaching the entire phonics system of English.\r\n\r\nYou get the first level (lessons 1 to 50) for free. You have the option of purchasing additional levels one at a time or purchasing all the levels at once at a discount.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the topics in each level:\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 1 (Lessons 1 to 50)\r\nSimple words with short vowels, single consonants, and consonant blends.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 2 (Lessons 51 to 80)\r\nConsonant digraphs (sh, ch, th, wh, ck), qu, x, ng and nk patterns, and doubled consonants.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 3 (Lessons 81 to 106)\r\nVowel digraphs (ee, ea, oo, ai, ay, oa, ou, ow, aw, au, oy, oi).\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 4 (Lessons 107 to 124)\r\nEndings (s, es, ed, ing, ful), apostrophes and more.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 5 (Lessons 125 to 147)\r\nSyllables, compound words, and multi-syllable words.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 6 (Lessons 148 to 155)\r\nSoft c and g patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 7 (Lessons 156 to 171)\r\nLong vowels in magic e syllables.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 8 (Lessons 172 to 183)\r\nLong vowels in open syllables.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 9 (Lessons 184 to 209)\r\n22 more long vowel patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 10 (Lessons 210 to 225)\r\nR-controlled vowels (ar, er, ir, or, ur, and more).\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 11 (Lessons 226 to 239)\r\n13 more short vowel patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 12 (Lessons 240 to 262)\r\nSilent letters and advanced patterns.",

I have to back all the way out and restart the app in order for it to play the sounds again. It has been the same problem ever since we started using it 3 weeks ago. Very frustrating. Please fix bug. When it does work, it is good and it is nice to be able to hear the sounds. I regret I paid for this.",
            "App doesn't work consistently. Very dissatisfied with how often I have to reset the app.",
            "Works great on my android phone, absolutely useless on my sons fire tablet. Gets stuck a few letters into practice and won't make any sounds. Restarting the app doesn't help either. Pretty annoyed I had to purchase it on 2 devices just to get one that works.",
            "I was hoping to use this app for a class and as a practice tool. But after downloading it, it has not worked. There is no sound. The whole point of this app is to help with phonogram sounds. I would not recommend this app."

Choose between new hairstyles and enjoy the improved idle animation. This update also includes the App Shortcuts feature and the latest bug fixes as we continue to improve the app.",
        "comments": [
            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "it seems okay on the surface, and the questions are pretty basic the only problem I see is the phrasing on the page before you start answering questions. it describes autism as a scale. the issue with this is that it makes autism seem more like a step ladder (as if someone can be \"a bit autistic\" or \"very autistic\") when really, the whole \"high/low functioning\" idea only describes how much people mask, which is incredibly harmful to their mental health.",
            "Why can't you put \"?\" for don't understand or it opens up and you can check the check box and or other: write what you mean but allow lots of room, also in the left corner you can push give feedback. And remember you need to make it word like it's for a small child that needs to understand, because that's my comprehension level ü§î.",
            "Am aware that an evaluation through a psychologist is fundamental for proper diagnosis, yet this app gives you a good idea if you in the spectrum or not. I have been obsessed with numbers, patterns and memorizing items since early childhood and found other little quirks along the way as I got older. This test gives me a rating of 33 percent and I see a good bit of truth in that. Thank you. I have shared it with many of my friends and the results are quite amazing and spot on.",
            "The app design is quite nice and technically it works well. However, the contents are really quite... stereotypical. I think they're stupid. It might as well straight up ask me 'Do you think that you have autism?'. Not every autistic person hates socialising. Not every autistic person loves numbers, dates and patterns. Not every aspie or autist struggle with imagination, reading others or planning. It gave me an average score - A group of real psychologists gave me an ASD (and ADD) diagnosis.",
            "Good test, but the interpretation of the result is just bad statistics. Look up the prosecutor's paradox. -- Thanks for the reply...  The app itself is fine... but the fact of making an app that offers this kind of test is gonna get you 1 star from me... sorry!  It's actually not a guide at all, since the probability of you being autistic is very low no matter what you score.  The only solid interpretation is that if you score like a \"neurotypical\" then you probably are one.  So maybe it should be called the Awesomely Neurotypical Test.  The result of tests that make people think they might be autistic is: 1) they clog up the GP and AMH with people who are clearly not autistic, making it even more difficult for adults with ASD to get diagnosed 2) the make people think that \"we're all on the spectrum\", which belittles the suffering that ASD causes.  So, yeah... 1 star."

            "Great start on this speech app. I like that I can move my articles onto an audio format. I can now do chores while getting caught up on the news. Some cons, It is the 1990s, not one thousand nine hundred and ninety S. It doesn't do acronyms very well. For example, FBI becomes FuhBuy. It seems to have difficulty with telling the main article from the picture description/explanation. I feel that this is a good start, and I will improve my score as they get some of those issues addressed.",

Speech Central is by far my favorite app for this.easy to use, love the voices, I'm able to set the reading speed a little faster than standard so I can move more quickly through the articles. The developer (Ivan) is exceptionally responsive to support requests. I use speech Central both on Android and iOS.",

            "I love this game, but, they only allow you 12 free tickets every 40 minutes or so. It costs at least 4 tickets to play 4 cards in a round. So, this 12 tickets yet burned up pretty fast. And, who wants to stop playing and have to exit the game and wait 40 minutes for more tickets??? It's a hassle! So, when you run out of tickets, they offer in ad purchases to buy more tickets, and that's where they get you. I have not found a bingo game that is actually free to play. It's a shame!!!",
            "ADDICTED!!!!!! I wish you would put an option in to use our coins to be able to buy at least 10 tickets. I'm a poor 49 year old with a son who plays 2 sports a senior in high school and a daughter who just graduated college and needed a reliable car. So I gave her mine, since she's an elementary school teacher and needs to mold the minds of the future game designer's who will take your jobs in the future..... Damn sorry to ramble on, let me buy tickets with coins. Respectfully, A broke Dad. Lol",
            "Playing higher level now. Fun, but having fewer bingos, than when I had played for the first time. The reason I stopped this game, before, was cause I got tired of seeming to be forced to buy things to progress. I became angry an frustrated. Time will tell if I put up with this for long. Hate to stop. But I will. Their second chance will end. Will update.",
            "By far the best bingo game I've played! The tutorial when starting the game is very helpful. So many options for avatar and dauber. The voice call outs are different from room to room which makes it more entertaining. The leveling up rewards are great. Not interrupted with ads. Not required to spend money (available if you want to). Only drawback is that your account doesn't work on multiple devices.",
            "This is the only Bingo app I play. You don't have to use real money if you can't afford to. The graphics are neat and there's lots of 'rooms' to play. One of my favorite things is how all the callers sound different. Some times there are one or two callers that have a thick accent, but it's easy to watch the 'boards foe which number is called."

            "I have to downgrade my initial rating of this game, since it stopped functioning correctly. It no longer connects to Facebook, giving me a message that I've been \"signed off,\" even though when I go into the Facebook app or ANY of my browsers, I'm signed into Facebook. Worse, the Windows 10 app doesn't work, either. Support told me to take steps I've already taken, then finally said they were \"fixing it in the next update,\" which was supposed to drop this week...and hasn't, of course.",
            "I love this game I have played it on and off for that last 10 plus years. I love how they always come up with new and exciting ways to keep you in the game. I just wish there was more ways of getting enough credits to continue to play when like myself tonight has not had such good luck and not gotten 1 bingo but I don't have any more credits so I'm done for the night until tomorrow when I get my daily ones",
            "I love this game and have been playing it for years. But over the past couple of weeks it's been kicking me out. There is definatly something wrong with the app and I hope you fix it soon. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it several times and each time it glitches at different areas. I have lost alot of game points because it has glitched in the middle of a game and i wasnt reimbursed. This comment has been up for 10 days, without ANY response from the game makers! PLEASE FIX ASAP!!",
            "Horrible. Game has really gone downhill. You used to be able to unlock cities by level up so if you could play any of them. Now you can't move from a city unless you get those stupid figure things and it's near impossible to get. You can never get bingo and good luck getting a treasure chest with the figure. You can't even play slots anymore. It was an amazing game and now it's just horrible.",
            "Would be 5-star if it wasn't so darn hard to earn bingo chips without purchases. I love the game and games within it, and look forward to my free stuff each day. It's nice to play a game that is entirely free though when you download a free game, hence my 4-star review."

        "description": "Oh no! Capt‚Äôn Hippocampus is going on account and he‚Äôll give no quarter! Unfortunately, he‚Äôs missing a few thing: a ship and a crew, for instance! But there‚Äôs a solution: he can take his raft to the letter islands and recover the word treasure. This treasure will make him incredibly rich, mainly in knowledge and experience, so that he can rescue his crew from the grip of the sinister sea monster Analphabetus and buy himself a ship.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hippocampus' Spelling C is a game adapted to kids learning to read and speak but learners of all ages can enjoy it and have fun while learning intuitively and independently.\r\n\r\nIt's time for English! Learn how to pronounce and to write English words as well as words from other languages (see list below). You can learn how to read and how to speak. This is the free version.\r\nCan learning to read be as easy and exciting as playing a computer game? We've developed a game with which you can learn to read intuitively and individually, as you would play a game.\r\nWe believe that a learning game has to be so good that it would encourage you to play it even though you might not be interested in its pedagogical content. We've done our best to implement this idea in our game. In doing so, we incorporate psycho-pedagogical foundations and concepts from the Montessori method, improve upon such tools as phonetic charts and present the syllables as they are actually spoken and not as they would be if spoken separately. Our emphasis is not on learning to recite the alphabet or spelling out words; on the contrary, instead of learning the ABC off by heart, the pupil learns which sounds actually occur in each word. As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.\r\n\r\nShould you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org \r\n\r\nThe game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. Similarly to the  Pimsleur method, you hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.\r\n\r\nContains: English, German, French, Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian, Italian, Turkish, Polish, Danish, Swedish, Bulgarian, Catalan, Georgian, Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, Greek",

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened. Also, they don't allow us to use all the words in the dictionary. I know we cant use proper nouns, but there are other words we should be able to use.",
            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "Like most of these HO games, things are frequently impossible to see, even zoomed in, on a phone. Other than that, great game. Enjoying it so far. Nothing innovative but visually beautiful and cute story. Edit; (Four stars down to two).Since the last update, buying extra seconds has more than doubled in price in an already VERY expensive game. More and more ads do not result in tools or time .",
            "This is a great hidden object game ‚ù§Ô∏èI've been playing for ab 2 years now, it is a little difficult at times but that's kind of the point,right? Great game, definitely worth playing. Only problem I have is it takes to long to get the items necessary to enter rooms,for example: ammo for hunting room,yellow balloons for Japanese garden other than that no complaints,ty for a great game!",
            "Good and fun game. The time limit is not enough for the rooms especially to twilight chamber room. Always want to buy extra 40secs from diamonds. Every single thing should be bought only via diamonds. No use of coins we earn. Match 3 are always the same. Again and again coming same levels. Irritating of playing the same again.",
            "This is my third review for this game.... I had only gave 3 stars last time because I was upset over an incident that happened with a purchase I made. After I left my review I noticed I had a response on here and that they would try to fix the problem, but unfortunately I had a phone issue and had to restart my game on a new phone, so it didnt matter anyway. I hadnt had any issues prior to that and I havent had any issues since then plus I absolutely love this game, so 5 stars it is.",
            "The game was pretty good for less than a week... The further you go the less free options are left. It's just became very frustrating and not really fun at all. Really hard to find objects and for every extra time and trophies you gotta pay or wait pretty looong. Well I had a good 1 week game. Ok üëå not anymore I guess."

            "Other apps only allow your child to make \"perfect\" letters. But this allows your child to progress from tracing to actually being able to see how their writing compares with the ideal. I found this app using my mobile but was unable to download it to my much older tablet. Is there an older version I may use for my 2015 device?",
            "The best writing app Ive used. Great graphics, music. Includes mini games to break up the writing every so often. Has rewards. Kids live it. Even bigger kids had a play! Lots of settings/options eg choose font; left handed; difficulty; formation style; voice off.",
            "Excellent app for preschool children to learn letters and numbers. My daughter is now a pro in letters and numbers by using this app. Just a suggestion, if you guyz can include words for beginners.",
            "Good kids app but very confusing. This app keeps running security scans for I don't know what reason. I didn't even give any permission to do anything on my phone. And it re-installed itself once I un-installed it. Any explanation??",
            "Stupid. Only a few letters are free and you have to pay for the rest UPDATE: I appreciate responses from developers, if they are polite and accepting of customer opinions. This is not. I'm not actually sure what the point of your response is? Reviews are not feedback for apps (though they can be used that way, sometimes) they are for others potential customers to see what others like and didn't like. I'm sorry my customer REVIEW was not useful for YOU, but you were not the intended audience. So really... #sorrynotsorry"

Every time it gets to, let's say, 93%, it crashes and takes me back to my phone's home screen. Then I have to restart the game only to see it crash again. I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",
            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",
            "Been playing for a few days and i am really enjoying this game, it seems to be more than fair so its not forcing me into making payments i dont want to make ect, there NO forced ads which is amazing too say. The gameplay is smooth and fun. The missions are repeated sometimes but hey, more money, xp and the 3rd time round its all 3x. Its nice to see a committed and fair developer. Thank You üëåüëçüíô",
            "There is no new exciting things and the game is become boring for me. Earning of coins is low and vehicle call cost is high and upgrade charges are too high. Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "Been playing this game for a couple of months now and still enjoying it. Ads are very short and do not interrupt gameplay. You can also opt for the ad free version. I personally especially like the challenge levels and the opportunity to watch full ads in order to earn rotations which can be saved and help loads if there are no suitable spaces left. A great game. No complaints at all üèÜ",
            "Love the game! However, to earn extra rotators you have to watch commercials. Sometimes many many commercials. The commercials are redundant. Based on your online searches, the commercials are geared to your interests. But if you enjoy watching American Girl 5 maybe 10 times in a row, this might be the game for you. They also offer different wood block games and show you those commercials over and over and over again. You would think if they would be a little creative.",
            "Great gamec- I initially liked this game. At first you could get a free rotator every 5 minutes plus a 30 second ad. Now I have to wait for a free rotator every 24 hours. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. I am part of a group of people who download games, test them, and grade them and pass our comments to them who then pass the recommendations on to everybody in the group and then we pass them on to our friends and family. I do not recommend this game in any way whatsoever.",
            "I Love Puzzles!!! Been playing this game for about a year or so and it's always fun and challenging. I enjoy a challenge with games like this! I will continue playing it. Happy to see the feature added of being able to rotate the piece to fit where you want it. Cool! Thanks!! Continue with enhancing the app to be even greater! üôÇ",
            "Rubbish app, spent more time restarting app than playing it. The first few days it was fine but as I ran out of rotates I watched a couple of ad's, to get some more, the app never worked correctly after that. It just kept freezing up. Was fun to play but since there are several versions I might try another block game"

            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "This is definitely the best browser I have ever used. I use this browser on my phone and my computer, and only this browser. Also, the new night mode is a really great feature, even for an experiment. Some things which I never knew had a dark mode are now dark, which makes things far better, especially since it is around the Halloween time and night mode sets the mood for it. Definite 5/5. I wish I could rate higher.",
            "A smooth browser, and they give me reports of how many trackers and ads the block on a regular basis! I love the privacy, and I've actually noticed a difference in the ads I get from when I had internet explorer. My only complaints (small ones) are that there is only a back button and no forward button, and that it can be somewhat difficult to make new files in bookmarks. Other than that, it is a great browser!",
            "It's the fastest browser I have ever used. But I have some problems- 1- Brave ask me to confirm my download only for the first time, after that it automatically starts downloading (it should ask everytime just like opera). 2- Tor should be included in the private session(as of now it's only available in pc mode). 3- A built in VPN should be included just like opera. If these problems are solved then I'll rate it 5 üåü. If anyone is reading this review, without a doubt you should give it a try!",
            "It's very fast. I like the idea of Brave rewards which allows the user to \"tip\" contributors, though still in its infancy, if it takes off in the 2020's, will help everyone from developers to artists to earn an income. I like the browser's user privacy factor. It feels like a skin of Chrome so it is easy to get used too. Check the browser out, after all it's free to use!",
            "For some reason if you're watching a YouTube video and you pause the video for any length of time, when you come back to it it automatically mutes the video. And you have about a three second window to unmute it. Also, Brave forces upon you a screensaver of the last thing you're looking at on brave. It's just very annoying. There's got to be a better app somewhere."

This App helps unlock your strengths and identifies challenges to your personal growth, offering advice and guidance that can help you be the best you can be, as well as gaining insights into any problem areas. Neurodiversity App is the first app worldwide that screens for neurodiversity and identifies strengths and challenges and provides practical suggestions to help you to be the best you can.\r\n \r\nWhat does this strength and challenge screening app do?\r\nThe ND App is a screener that processes your information to produce a personalised skill-set report. ND App uses state of the art research and latest technology to ‚Äéhelp identify your strengths and challenges in these areas - Cognitive skills, Emotion, Feelings, Organising, Time Management, Speaking, Listening, Literacy, Numeracy and Motor Skills. The highly informative report can provide a discussion point with those who support you, including family, managers and educational support. Revolutionary technology developed by internationally recognised cognitive and learning specialists creates your report identifying key areas that may require attention.\r\n\r\nWho can ND App help?\r\nThe app, questions and reports are designed for anyone over 16 years of age who wants to understand themselves better and thinks they maybe neurodiverse or already been diagnosed having one or more conditions but wants a better understanding of themselves overall.\r\n\r\nIs ND App accessible?\r\nYes. ND App is at the forefront of accessible technology enabling questions and reports to be read out aloud. You can also change colours and fonts.

This may need to be considered when completing the tool if you do have a visual or hearing impairment.\r\n\r\nHow can ND App help me?\r\nIt can help you to start to understand your strengths and challenges, be they are home, work or in education. The report can be emailed to you, identifies key areas that may require some attention and provides practical tips to help. Although designed as a screener, it may provide a starting point for discussions such as managers, in education or your family. It may help you to consider if having a full diagnostic assessment would be worthwhile. \r\n\r\nIs there lots of reading to do?\r\nThe questions and the onscreen report can be read out to you using your phone text-to-speech.\r\n\r\nWhat areas does it look at?\r\nYou may have come across terms such as neurodiversity, a positive term that describes people who have a varying cognitive profile. Conditions under this umbrella term include: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC), Dyscalculia, Dyslexia, Developmental Language Disorders and Developmental Co-ordination Disorder (also known as Dyspraxia). There is a lot of terminology out there, and the focus is to identify specific areas of challenge as well as looking at what you are good at.

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",
            "Game is great.. expensive if you want to keep up...but it never ever connects for me the 1st time . and it's not my interent it's your server...One time I have to use my interent then I have to use my data..and most times I have to go back and forth 3 or 4 times to see which it will take...and this is every single day a few times a day .it never is the same and takes forever to load when it finally gets working.. but I do love the game! I am addicted just wish you would fix those 2 things..."

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

We've developed a game with which you can learn to read intuitively and individually, as you would play a game.\r\nWe believe that a learning game has to be so good that it would encourage you to play it even though you might not be interested in its pedagogical content. We've done our best to implement this idea in our game. In doing so, we incorporate psycho-pedagogical foundations and concepts from the Montessori method, improve upon such tools as phonetic charts and present the syllables as they are actually spoken and not as they would be if spoken separately. Our emphasis is not on learning to recite the alphabet or spelling out words; on the contrary, instead of learning the ABC off by heart, the pupil learns which sounds actually occur in each word. As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.\r\n\r\nShould you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org \r\n\r\nThe game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. You hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.",

As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.<br><br>Should you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org <br><br>The game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. You hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

Please refund my payment as I cancelled within the day. Thanks.",

            "Used to love Firefox but, after the last update, all I can say is IT IS NOW CRAPPOLA. Everything is different. Add-ons are either gone completely or don't work right, can't find my favorites list, can't get it set up like I had it. Can't print because of no print function. Also, can't use my theme. This is NOT an improved version. It's garbage. GO BACK TO HOW IT WAS!",
            "Generally I like Firefox.... however the new update is clearly glitchy. Now when I listen to podcasts I have to keep that website open and on top of the other apps or it shuts the podcast off after 60 seconds (I timed it). Then I have to go back to the web page with the podcast and reload it to start listening to it all over again. This is really annoying in general, but even worse at night when I'm listening to a podcast in bed. Previously I could shut the screen off and listen in the dark, now the screen has to be on all the time which is wasting my battery. I've gone through my setting on the app & phone from one end to the other trying to find some setting to change, but it doesn't exist. Please fix this :)",
            "Just like others, I too have complaints regarding the 10.20.20 update. The auto deletion of data when you close the app doesn't work. The deletion of Tabs after 1 day doesn't work. The add-ons don't work. I can go on, but I only have 500 characters to express my dissatisfaction with your browser. It's quite obvious you don't read your negative reviews because more than 1 person is having the same problems as me & nothing is being done. I love your desktop version, but this 1 has become unusable",
            "I rarely rate any apps. That being said, I felt I had to make my feelings know about the latest update. Firefox has always been my default browser. It's been a five-star app forever. This update has completely ruined my experience with Firefox. It's no longer fully customizable to suit my preferences, something that has kept me with Firefox for years. It's bland; basically just a half-step above the DuckDuckGo browser. The new browser only supports a bare minimum of add-ons. Try harder guys.",
            "Was good, new update not so much. The new update makes it a multi step process to get to your bookmarks/frequent sites. Before, they would be listed when you tap the address bar. If not fixed, I'm going with another browser after all these years with Firefox. Update-still no quick way to access bookmarks/frequent sites. I want to able to tap the address bar and be presented with that list."

            "It is a very nice educational game and it love it ever since i started playing i fill well.

Thankyou for it..",

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so üíØ happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 üåü is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò"

Actually I thought of dwonloading other game but your game has make me intelligent üòã and it's interesting while I'm doing nothing but your game has a feeling that makes me happy because I answer and the game asked haha Btw the best is the multiplication stage ahh it's sad that now people doesn't have time to play like your game but other shooting games like PUBG but still this is the best game ever. And BTW Name's SIZZLE 13 years old üòÅ ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",

Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

            "There is nowhere in the app to contact you, so here it is...your Age of Voyage spinning wheel is a JOKE! The piece that moves when you spin the wheel sometimescounts the spot it is on as the FIRST move and sometimes it doesn't! I have had spins that SHOULD have landed me on a \"SAIL but it doesn't because of the way it moves that I just described. SO UNFAIR!!",
            "It's a good game overall. The only thing I would change is a little longer time on the last number called. It doesn't give you enough time when you're playing with multiple cards to hit that last number on all the cards. Pretty good payout. Hey bingo games when you can't play them because you run out of coin and they don't give you much.",
            "I'm really liking this bingo game but had to give it 3 stars because you only get a set amount of tickets a day and the buy in for the special event games is like 3x the daily amount. To get more tickets other than to buy them you have to complete daily tasks BUT the daily tasks are only eligible in the special event games so they're unachievable. So basically this is a pay to play game after you spend all your tickets given when you first download app.",
            "This game really sucks now! You can't finish the album cause u only win duplicate cards. For over 3 weeks, I have not been able to open my gift box and most of the games, especially any new tournament games. I've lost out on gifts from Tony and being sble to send and receive in the gift box. Fix your damn technical errors!!!!!",
            "When i first downloaded this game it looked nothing like the ads i had seen for it. Then i discovered the more games tab at the bottom of the page and discovered it's an add on for rooms...there i found the games from the ads and many many more. There are enough games here to keep anyone busy for a long time and all different themes and types of play. I'm an avid player and love bingo. But this is quickly becoming my favorite app i've ever used. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

The repetitive nature of it is stimulating and rewarding because he feels like he is doing work. But he knows what to do and it isn't overwhelming. I thought that he would find it too simple because his favorite game is Minecraft, which is very challenging. But the music and graphics really strikes a chord.",

            "Its a great game, but with a game so simple how come there are so many glitches?? 5 consecutive levels freeze up during a stupid ad to where I have to back out of the game and reopen it! Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

I logged in with the Google play account today but can't load the previous progress , I also checked the Google play account it still shows I made some 14 achievements.",
            "Gameloft should be shivering with embarrassement at this failure of a game and someone needs to be fired. The disrepect they show to the players is unreal. The game is overrun with cheaters who stand outside the maps and kill everyone. Turrets still fire through walls. Every other game is filled with players who stand still but you can't shoot them but they shoot you. This game is unplayable and the european staff responsible should be fired. Scum, just scum.",

            "The graphics are fairly good, and so as the story line but there is a major issue that is server. I could barely play a complete match before it says network lost even when I have Wifi router connection. I don't think it's network issue may be it's your server issues..."

            "I really enjoy this game! I love the fallout series as well as the elder scrolls games, Bethesda is by far the best. Now this game has some things it could use, one of those is the ability to move rooms around without destroying them, or even widen the vault a bit so you can fit three full rooms along with 2 or 3 elevators. I also wish the rarity chance was a teensy bit higher for legendary dwellers, there are more things, but I only have 500 letters to use. Fix those two and I'll update this :)",
            "Good graphics, good gameplay, no \"it is free-to-play, but pay us or wait for years to finish building\", no \"you will play forever no matter what mistakes you do\" (you can lose and it makes you think what to do). You do not have to play each day (do not afraid of missing something or losing state). You can even select difficult level! It is something I missed from old time. One of great games for smartphone, I like it!",
            "It feels like a game to download just to kill time, but I'm addicted to it. I love the graphics and the humor. And the only time you get ads is when you want to skip something for free, there is not a ton of ads like most other games. I love to name the characters and RP what life in the vault would be like and turn on fallout music on youtube in the background. It's the best free game I've played in a long time. Thank you so much to the developers for making us this game for free. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "I love this game. And have for years. However upon getting into contact with the developer, days later they've ignored me on multiple accounts. Ive emailed them around a half dozen times and they've only responded 3 times. All of which was not helpful. And now, not only do I feel completely scammed, I feel disrespected as a player. Take this into consideration if you make a purchase. They will suck at communicating back with you.",
            "Would be 5 stars but there's a glitch that adds 270+ hours to the daily reward and that isn't great. Edit: I have now changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because as of the new update I am unable to actually load the game. It asked for access to media and files, which is fine, but then it started a weird download and once it finishes the game gets stuck in a frozen loading screen. Closing and reopening the app just restarts the download. Please fix and I'll change my review back to 4 star."

            "I loved these varied and exceptionally challenging math puzzles. The hints provided were helpful, but were not so obvious as to give away the answer without serious thought. You really have to think outside the box; nonlinear thought is required to figure out the underlying pattern. Once you identify the pattern, it is then straightforward to solve the puzzle.",
            "Enjoyable and a bit challenging at times. There were a couple of problems that weren't clear how you were supposed to know to use a certain number as a reference. The clearest form of this was on one of the questions, the hint was \" - 40\". I dont know how I was supposed to know to subtract each answer from 40. It just seemed like an arbitrary number that you had to use the hint to know. Other than those questions, which there were only a few, I really enjoyed using this app.",
            "Good for getting basic math practice in from what I am able to play. Unfortunately I am stuck on a level that requires multiple entries and will not allow multiple entries. I had the right answer, but could not enter it. Very frustrating. Maybe a quick tutorial on the various ways you may have to enter answers would fix this. I probably could figure it out if it isn't a bug, but there are millions of games out there. This just turned me off. Next!",
            "Made me recall the simple rules like pemdas, also adding some \"additional\" rules to solve levels as they progress; many answers based on correlation of number sets. Being dyslexic, this game is/was very empowering for me, as I started out sailing through without having to write anything down to solve any of the puzzles. However, after I got stuck on level 58 (by coincidence) my shrink lowered my adderall dose and now I can't make it past level 30 without working the problems on paper. :(",
            "Some of the puzzles are pretty difficult, but none are too difficult that they can't be completed with a little math knowledge and a bit of outside-the-box thinking. Overall, I enjoyed this app, and completing it is a good brain exercise. Some of the puzzles don't actually require math to solve, which annoyed me at first, but after doing a few I thought it was good to force my brain to think more outside the box than just simply looking for a mathematical pattern. Pretty darn good app."

            "I've tried many OCR apps (image to text converter) and none of them came close to what this app produces. Although it is still not perfect yet (which is mainly because of infinite handwriting styles), at least it doesn't produce gibberish like the other apps. I hope the algorithm keeps improving and it would be great if you could add speech for other language texts too.",
            "Have been looking for an app to transcribe my handwritten notes to editable text for a while. Just downloaded this app after reading a positive review. The said OCR is by no means perfect, but then neither is my handwriting and so far I am actually pretty impressed. I like to save an image of the page to OneNote and then copy the transcribed text next to it. Would be great if I could setup a macro to do both in one go.",
            "On my galaxy s9 I am using this app in tandem with quizlet (split screen view) to create a study guide. I'm surprised I couldn't find this option on google keyboard, but this is a fine alternative. Ads are annoying but never that bad, and the very empirical way the text is transcribed is much appreciated. 5 stars for functionality, overall 4.7 because ads",
            "Top of the line, excellent for small receipts and business cards. Good for books but you might need two or three takes per page. I couldn't test it properly for handwriting during the very limited trial time allowed. Overall the development of this APP is marvelous, excellent work!",
            "This app has been a very useful tool. I'm so grateful for the intelligence put into making it. God bless you guys. Edit. Now you can't use this app without subscription. It gives you a trial period, after which, you have to subscribe to use it. It's been good while it lasted. Goodbye, I'm uninstalling now."

And says outlandish number of seconds until the game starts like 2868 seconds until the game starts and then all sudden I'm starting to game and then it kicks me out when there is 20 bingos left and says game over and then kicked me out saying that there's a data error",
            "*Update: 10-7-20 I haven't played for a while and I have no clue how to turn on Epic or whatever, but I also just lost 60 tickets! I bought 1 card in Candy Crush and accidentally hit the back button, even before the game had started and went straight back in and it took my tickets and didn't even give me my card!! Smh! * Love the game but there's only like 18 bingos per 180 cards. Need more bingos and I'll give u 5 stars! It's no fun when u rarely win a bingo!",
            "Great, fun game; BUT do not be fooled, this company is out to rip you off. The stupid bucks are so hard to get, rewards take ages and dollars, and even the farm town part is totally a rip-off. On top of that, they don't allow you to watch vids for things. I understand charging for lots of extras, but then your money doesn't even go anywhere.. these are fake items on a phone ppl are purchasing.",
            "How about fixing your technical issues! Have not been able to send and receive gifts for a week! Cannot open new locations, too! Fix it!!!! Still not fixed; can't even open Tasks now. You suck! I have logged in and out of FB numerous times, still not fixed! I uninstalled and re-installed this game 3 times; still cannot open gift box, today's Tasks , and now the icon has disappeared where you can do the daily and royal challenge, WTH!!!!! You need to fix your ridiculous technical issues!!!#",
            "It freezes up on me. I was trying to select the number of cards to play and it me to the mystery purchase page, meanwhile the balls were being called and would not let get on the page to play.....this happened THREE times. ...,.I'd select the number of cards to play and the mystery purchase page comes up....over and over!! Do i need uninstall it?"

            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",

            "It is a good game but has its quirks. The bone pile is hidden during play and only visible when you draw from it. If you're not careful and hold the piece while you're placing, it, it will go to the closest matching piece. When the game is over, it covers the board so you can't review the game. Scoring is puzzling, for instance; our team score was almost 8000 and overnight dropped more than 2000 points. There is no way to remove deadbeat or caustic players from the team.",
            "Love the game, the colors and play of the game is nice. but there is an error with this app...Whenever there is a draw, the computer automatically gives the round to the opponent/computer. Also, tap-to-play causes misplays. This app can be better by:. 1) Showing how many bones are left in the boneyard. 2) allowing online play with other humans. 3) making a 3-player, and 4-player option. 4) add a carribean style play mode, where you don't win by points but after a set number of games one.",
            "Needs updates bad! The boneyard play is awful. Whether it is in my favor or not, it is ridiculous how this one pull gets the exact domino needed for an advantage, it is frustrating when you strategize to send your opponent to the yard and for them to only pull one bone nearly everytime and it's usually the exact one needed. I would be here all week describing the scenarios that I've witnessed, but overall it seems like the game leans in favor of the player of it's choice. IJS",
            "Downloaded this game as something to help me wind down (and at first it was) but, with all the updates, it's turned into a constant source of frustration. The scripting is so obvious I can guess what domino the computer will play without even seeing their dominoes. This game has gone very downhill very quickly.",
            "I've been playing this for about a year and have begun to notice that there are about 8 - 10 games that continually repeat, it's like being in \"Groundhog Day.\" I didn't notice this at first, i thought it was random shuffling, but am seeing it more frequently for the last month or so... Today the game played first, starting with a 3x6 domino, then on its second play it played a double 6! Very frustrating! The game doesn't even follow its own rules, i.e., the first player starts play with..."

            "The best app to listen to Marathi and English audio books at a very affordable price. This is the only provider that has wide variety of Marathi audio books that I was not able to find anywhere else. I was only interested in Marathi books and recently Storytel added a subscription option for Marathi only content at even less monthly subscription price. That's really awesome. App is also good, never hanged or created any issues. New audio player is better than last one and I am sure the team would be improving the player further. Short stories are excellent and there are frequent new releases. These are really good if you want to have a quick fun read/listen and lighten your mood or learn something new quickly. Statistics section is also good to understand your listening habits. 5 Stars for providing us with such a good variety of audio books and podcasts. Few things that can make the app better 1- Support for web based player so that we can also use it on PC. 2- Pause the audio when there is a notification on mobile. The app currently keeps audio playing in background if there is a notification. Most of audio apps pause the audio and after the notification sound, resumes the audio 3- Increase library content for latest English audio books (there are review or summaries available for latest books but feel that there is lack of latest English content compared to other providers). 4- Separate section for podcasts and books. Right now podcasts are mixed with books which for me is bit confusing. I start listening thinking that it is a book and then realize that its actually a podcast 5- Maybe have a modern color and look for the app. Current app works great, but looks a bit outdated. Also add support for light and dark modes 6- If possible, add option to buy books so that we can keep them forever and can listen to them anytime later even if the subscription expires. Also, search feature needs improvements. If I search for something, usually there are no results. Every time I have to depend on the curated lists or book tips section to find something that I would like to listen.",
            "It seems impossible to search for anything. I would assume that I have to press the magnifying glass and then enter search terms, but nothing happens. EDIT: After further inspection, it turns out that the heading \"Search\" on top of the screen is not a heading, it becomes the search field when tapped. The big magnifying glass in the middle of the screen is not functional. Not very intuitive to me.",
            "Really good app/service. I rated 4/5 because it could use some improvements to get even better. I like that with a monthly subscription I have access to all the titles in the library - unlike other services that charge the monthly fee plus credits and/or extra money to buy the book. The selection is decent, pretty good on latest releases, but I would like to see more old books too. It would be nice if the chapters were actually named like the chapters in the book instead of just numbers.",
            "1) Too many notifications - I expect from an app I pay for to \"sit\" quietly and wait for me to decide when and if I need it, but not remind me twice a day that I have to do something with it. 2) Not user friendly - it took me some time to find the search hidden somewhere behind the menu. It was quite difficult for me to find books in English. 3) Quite limited number of books in English. At least for Bulgaria."

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",

Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",

I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",

The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "Could mix things up a little. Have different goals, maybe some times levels, maybe some with more differences. Otherwise a good solid play, not overtaken by ads & so far, no political ads!!",
            "Challenging and great pictures. Very clear and interesting photography. Zoom is helpful and pictures don't blur when using it. I like the sound effect on sometimes and sometimes not so it is nice to have a choice. Also the adds are not annoying and do not pop up during game play. I like that I can choose any picture to play. Hints are helpful for that bugger at the end I just can't find. I like the star indicating how many I have left to find. And not having a timer is a huge plus to me.",
            "Fun game, pictures are great. Would love if it told you where the pictures were taken. I would recommend this Find the Differences game",
            "This is a very fun game to play and relax. It has a nice mix of easy, moderate, and challenging screens. There was an earlier section where the programming was messed up and you could only indicate the differences on the bottom screen. If you touched the upper screen it gave you an X and took away some of the heart, but would not let it replenish itself. I very much prefer 5 differences to 10 per challenge.",
            "The pictures are pretty similar all the way through the game, going through maybe 10 different themes like buildings, rooms, table settings, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult, and the devs didn't make the game cheesily difficult with tiny little differences to spot. Because of that, each level takes between 15 seconds and 2 minutes, making this a perfect little time waster."

In this update we improve the call blocking experience for users on Android 10 (‚ÄúAndroid Q‚Äù) and higher: incoming calls that you wish to block will now be blocked completely, and not forwarded to voicemail! You can enable this behavior by setting Hiya as your default caller ID app. Please let us know of any feedback regarding this change. We also squashed some bugs and ensured things are running smoothly overall.",

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you HiyaüëÑ",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put √¨n my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",

            "These app is nice but there is a big problem I can't even start my editing till 2 or 3 hours gone. It doesn't start than how am I going to edit. The app good it has one of the best templates and editing filters. But it also takes very much time to render. I don't know what is the problem or is there any problem with my phone or this editing software",
            "Would rate 5 stars, but there's a problem. I can only load images into my projects. If I try to load videos it will just glitch and become a white screen. I tried leading a video and then putting an image after it, and for the video it was just white. It wouldn't even play! But when I moved to the image, it worked perfectly fine and normal. Pleeaaaaaase fix this. It really sucks to only be able to edit with images *Edit: this only happened AFTER the Halloween update.",
            "The best video editing app! Absolutely what i needed but. 4 stars cuz, the speed feature isn't working. Only if we could get more styles for titles and subtitles which should be regularly updated. Then i think the app is pretty cool and also if we could add photos over a background and could actually resize it and that kinda stuff. But the app's still pretty cool! Gonna use it! And if you do consider my requests imma give a 5 star~",
            "This was the only app I used to use for editing all my videos but now God Knows and The Creators Know what they've done to the app in the last update but it Malfunctions Very Badly in my device (I'm on Vivo Y12) I edited a video in it a few days ago and when I saved it, it got saved BUT my voice got cut off after the first 9 mins and I resaved it 3 times, still the same and also now today when I'm trying to open the file to save it again they don't even lemme open the file! Plz fix it asap üôèüôè",
            "Can you make it so it's not so laggy it's a great app everything is free you can take off the watermark. But when I put a video in it takes too long for its load.And trust me this is an amazing app but can you make it so it's not laggy and it doesn't load for a long time. I don't know if it's a problem with my phone or my storage or it's just something with the app I have to wait and a complete hour for it to load."

And it is my second favorite app . My first favorite app also have ads. U can also take pictures and u can give filters, u can colour it .etc. all people can try it. If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.üòä",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ‚ô°",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ‚ú®",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

It offers a free puzzle every day, but very seldom can you actually download that puzzle, or even see it in your available puzzles list. You can watch ads to get Clues, but lately that's been causing the app to crash at times so that you have to restart it. Also, some of the pictures are quite interesting and merit closer study, but as soon as they are revealed they vanish almost instantly.",

Then it said that I have to rate the game. When I rated the game, I went to the game to play again. But it said I have to rate but I already did. So I deleted the review and decided to write a really mean review. IF YOU WILL REGET IT. PLEASE DO NOT GET THE GAME.",

I am so angry. Defenitly deleting the game.",

What do you learn from it? -you learn many ways on life basics especially on how to do something or try to escape something. You learn many things and also this game helps you revise on what you do at school like knowing the numbers on the clock or auditioning number combinations you unlock this draw!

            "Was a great game until the developers doubled the ad content. Not only that, but now the game is freezing after I make my final move to win the level, especially if I use a rainbow ball. If I use a rainbow ball in conjunction with another booster, regardless of what part of the level I'm at, the game freaks out and closes. When it does this, I have to redo the level again. If this continues, I will uninstall and reflect this in an update.",
            "I like this game because it is very relaxing. I also love the choices it gives you to work with. I personally love modern i think it is a cozy and cute inviorment to live in. I also love the matching game it gives you a way to get money. It is like a win win because you get to design and you get to match and overall i think this game is very good and that is why i gave it a five and if i had one complant it would be for a little bit more choices for the fashion sence. I will have my friends play",
            "Stupid & FULL OF ADS. Initially it was pretty good with not many ads. Now it's gotten so bad that there's not just 1 30+ second ad after every game, but 2 or even 3! It is beyond ridiculous how many ads you're forced to sit through in this game. On another note, it annoys me how the characters have been portrayed. The man looks strong and composed, hands folded across his chest. The woman, meanwhile, always has her mouth open, head bobbing, eyes squinting, looking like a silly child-like bimbo.",
            "I like this game because its direct. I mean other renovating games they ask us to earn stars to complete tasks. And those tasks include stupid ones like call a person, look under the bed, etc. But this only involves renovating and nothing else. No wasting time in listening to the people talking. I hate matching games but I'm putting up with it just because o this game is direct. I simply want a renovating game which doesn't have matching games, which doesn't have any stupid tasks and less talk",
            "I like this game because its quick. The graphics are good (not tiny little triangles squares and circles) Also you don't have to play loads of games to get furniture. The prices are pretty reasonable.so you get through rooms quicker"

            "Ok...i tried it...it is nice but when i was playing it I felt like something was wrong...then I knew what it was.The everything is too expensive. If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",
            "I like this game alot! It is really entertaining to read. I always read the stories at night cause it is better to me! U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

            "I love the app and all, but it's just the ads... I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

ABSOLUTE JOKE! GARBAGE! And why do I have to have a cardboard viewer or one with a qr code? Mine doesn't have a qr CODE do I need to spend more money now? Honestly 1 star is too much! You ruined the VR experience!",
            "Without 6dof movement and the use of hands, having to use this app for VR would be horrible. I'm glad I have my Oculus Quest, created via the Android OS as a platform specifically for VR. Do not invest in mobile VR unless you are willing to set the bar for mobile VR, which you haven't. It wouldn't be hard to make a sensor headset that does the controller tracking, with the phone's gyroscope and camera mapping out the virtual environment. AR tracking would be handled by the phone's camera.",
            "Buggy and hard to navigate and understand. Non intuitive for something so vital to expanding the knowledge of VR. Life cycle cut short too. This should still be supported. It brings people that do not know about modern VR to VR. If it worked correctly and a bluetooth mouse and keyboard were the controllers, this would be the app that kickstarted the VR revolution. Instead it's a reminder of what could have been and leads non VR owners to believe VR is complicated, proprietary and expensive.",
            "Cannot set up my vr glasses. I don't have the code. I had to spend a hour hunting online for the no button QR code. But somehow the app had one eye looking forward one eye at 90%. Useless, but I couldn't reset to normal cardboard vr without reinstalling! I appreciate they want to make it easy for kids, but where's the advanced mode for adults to customize glasses setup. I don't get why with no button I cannot just stare for 5 seconds at the menu choice to select like other vr apps. Arrg!",
            "Total Junk! This looked like an app made Google, who also made this funky cardboard thing I strapped to my face. Did all the login stuff, opened the cartoon gui, moved my head to select \"next\", the app kept insisting I push a non-existent button on the edge of my phone. Went through all the settings to find \"hands free\" mode, no such thing. Even if the button did exist on the side of my phone, why would anyone want to touch at an uncomfortable piece of folded paper on their face?"

Interface is pretty solid, and even thinking that having to pay for the premium to use dark mode (who I'm a huge fan of), is still not a big of a deal, and for sure won't make me dislike this app at all. Probably my favorite Pok√©dex app I have ever seen. Keep up the good work! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®",
            "I love this app, and all of the team builders that I can save. Its great for my mind that won't shut up. My only issue is that for the team builder, I can't select regional forms of pokemon for my team (i.e. Galarian Ponyta). I can evolve some (i.e. Pikachu) to it's regional form, but not the ones that don't have a split evolution. Aside from that, its a wonderfully made app with frequent updates!",
            "This is amazing!! I can look at the locations and for the upper gens 5-8, I can actually check the area, like for Sword and Shield, not only does it tell me where the pokemon appears in, but I can see the conditions such as \"It only appears when it's raining\". If I have one problem though, it has to be the cries of the gen 8 pokemon. They sound very low quality and in some cases, it sounds a bit like your device's speaker is broken. Crown Tundra is here, aling with the locations!",
            "This app literally has everything you could possibly want in a pokedex app. It has a full pokedex/itemdex for information and location, and team building with in depth analysis of weaknesses and coverage. There is nothing left out! I dont see how any other app can compete with what dataDex offers. Not to mention they update the app often so they are always giving the most new and accurate information! 5/5 EZ",
            "Very nice app, and it could be great! Would love to see the ability to search through all available swsh pokemon, and not have them broken up by galar/isle of armor/crown tundra. It's super nice that I can sort the dex by a stat, but i wish i could sort every pokemon. Also, there are some issues with the move dex. I don't think that the \"Pokemon who learn this move\" works right. I'd also love to be able to sort by moves available in swsh. Not just moves introduced in swsh, and no removed ones."

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",

But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",

            "Even once I figured out the weird and clunky UI most things don't work \"unable to load [command] at this time\" with no explanation. While trying to borrow a book I accidentally borrowed 5 the same one 3 times (no visual feedback and I had the sound turned down) and now I can't return them (\"unable to load return book at this time\")",
            "Its easy when you know how. I think an added line in the instructions would make it more friendly to use. Effectively you need to press each selection three times, example - select number 6, then select it (number 6) again twice more to accept your selection - select number 1, then select it (number 1) again twice more to accept your selection. This is the same for the letters later on when looking for books. I myself am not a good reader hence me using audio books. I would ask the people who write the instructions to be more considerate for people like me please.",
