            "The language comprehension starts with an example nr 100 or so. How can we start with really easy ones for objects? I see it is a free version, so only an example, but I did not find in the app how can we get a full access. I need to start for my child with objects labeling.",
            "I like the exercises this app has to offer, but my concern is with the icon that sounds like it is talking to a very little kid. My husband is already feeling like a baby with everything else that goes with his stroke from surgery for a glioblastoma. He has a very long term recovery ahead, and this app looks like it would help, but I also have to consider his feelings.",
            "For a recovery app that is intended for adults that have had a stroke or other brain injury it is very juvenile. same set up as the kids games. Make it friendly for all age groups. The encouraging voice is to childish and the whoka word it says is very annoying. Please make this so it is geared for adults. Thank you.",
            "The exercises are great and I quite like the progress and pace of them. I use this app with my cousin with Autism, and while it requires us to tutor him at times, he quite likes the app and finds I easy it use. Most aphasia apps ive found require quite a bit of money in order to unlock other content (content thats not that great too) so i appreciate how much you offer without the premium charge.",
            "Just downloaded this for my Autistic son for the cognitive therapy aspect. He is almost 8 years old. It was a huge hit and very educational for him. He is very hard to keep focused, but with this app he just wanted to keep going! That is why I am giving it 5 stars!"

This app claims to be designed for aphasia (a language disorder, generally in the adult/geriatric population), but seems much more appropriate for expressive language disorders in children (which is characterized by children having difficulties forming language, but can pronounce speech sounds correctly). Regardless, if this app encourages practice to reach goals set by a trained/certified SLP, it is beneficial.",

            "It would be nice to have a paid version without ads.",
            "Finally something professional looking, incredibly simple and useful! Thank you so much :) My 2 cents: It would be awesome if there was a speech option to read all the text aloud and each word could be highlighted as it was read. As is, I think I will need to be with my mom to help her navigate the menus and games. Simplicity of big photos with the words on the main page is perfect! But once you click \"math\" the second page should be just as clear and simple (could use symbols +×÷=). Thanks!",

            "It's a great app. with core vocabulary! You can form sentences, edit/customize pages and pictures, add pages and pictures, and it's super easy to navigate! Anddd it's free!! I highly recommend this app!!",
            "I'm too old to figure this out.... Need something that lets me use the keyboard to type and then read that out loud. Maybe have a library of phrase I've input.... Communication outside of my computer is too tedious no matter what.",
            "This app has been a life-saver; we use it to support our communications with our child on the autistic spectrum. The app in itself has to be personalized, and it is NOT easy.. It is time-consuming to get the personalized images (although they have an extensive generic image bank) up, as well as the pronunciation you wish on specific names or words. And, it is nearly impossible to transfer a profile between android devices. Yes, the app could be better, and it is a shame there is no more technical support offered for it, but I am giving it five stars because it is free, and it has been a massive help to us. Thanks!",
            "I found this yesterday and have been playing around with it-I have 18 years experience working for children who have execptionalities. This is a wonderful app for anybody who may need a voice at times but do not have professional supports in place yet. My son has found it easy to navigate and loves that I was able to personalize the labels. The only issue I've had so far pertains to rearranging the pictures, they didn't stay where I put them.",
            "Trying numerous augmented communication apps for my daughter and this one was the closest to what she use to have on the ipad when the device died. Awesome app. Very easy to set up, a lot of setting options to customize for the needs of the individual and it does not matter how long she pushes the button, it will say the word. Speech can be a little odd but this app gives you the ability to use other voice apps to change the sound. After trying quite a few, this is the one which fit all my needs. Will be donating money to the developer as soon as I can. Great job and thank you so very much!"

Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",

Elle s'adresse principalement aux personnes touchées d'aphasie qui ne parviennent plus à trouver les sons des mots qu'ils ont en tête ou à articuler des phrases. Et en général, elle peut concerner tous ceux qui ont besoin de faire un travail d'orthophonie et de prononciation orale.\r\n\r\nChaque exercice contient une image et le but est d'essayer de prononcer ce qu'elle représente. Vous pouvez vous aider de l'enregistreur sous la question afin de comparer votre réponse à la solution. Les nombreux boutons sonores donnent des indices et des aides. Par association d'idée, la personne aphasique travaille la diction et la formation des sons.

I can write whatever sentence I want and make custom sections, like ones for work. My only wish is I wish there was a male voice I could have on but apart from that it's wonderful, thank you!",
            "Needs dark mode and an additional quick talk mode that adds a talk-as you-type option as used in other AACs. For example in the type section when users type a word and hit space the word is spoken. Also the type interface needs an additional backspace or a long press option on the exiting backspace button that can remove the previous word all at once one word at a time and each word after that the longer the backspace is held down.",

While not as intricate, this app was pretty well made. Although in the end, I went with LetMeTalk, this app was a strong contender and is very well designed.",

Research shows that almost all stroke patients could do more than just their regular rehab, so we’ve come up with a plan that you can do at home in between your scheduled appointments. We want you to reach your full recovery potential.\r\n\r\nOur scientifically-backed program supports you on your journey. Whether you’re a stroke survivor or caregiver, our app gives you a clear plan for each day and explains why the exercises are important. You’ll feel good knowing what you need to be doing and why it works.\r\n\r\nIn our testing phase, we offer two research-tested walking courses. They are free for a limited time while we are working on other courses. Give it a try and let us know what you think!\r\n\r\nSCIENCE-BASED COURSES\r\nOur team combs through thousands of scientific articles to see what’s new in the field of stroke rehabilitation. We take the relevant findings and build them into our plan. This way, you get the most out of every exercise.\r\n\r\nOur courses are tested before we bring them to you. When there is evidence that a new course works, we make it available to you.\r\n\r\nWe also let you know why our program is structured the way it is. We don’t expect you to jump in without knowing why you are doing something. That’s why we provide you with the science behind our thinking. We offer you a selection of articles that highlight the findings we came across in our research and explain how they relate to the course.\r\n\r\nPERSONALIZED APPROACH\r\nEvery stroke is different and each patient has a different functional level afterward. That’s why our programs can be personalized. We start where you are. Our first order of business is to assess your current level so that we can adjust your plan. From there, we set your goals and accompany you along the way.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE AT HOME\r\nMany patients tell us that they want to do more for their recovery, but they just aren’t sure what will work in addition to their regular rehab. Strokemark gives you a clear plan of what to do each day. No need to wait until your next appointment to get some instructions.\r\n\r\nWe offer clearly structured, easy-to-follow, 6-week courses to help you along your way. You’ll receive simple instructions about what and how much to do every day. When you do it is up to you – that’s the luxury of having exercises you can do at home.\r\n\r\nIMPROVE YOUR WALKING\r\nBeing able to walk steadily and surely leads to greater independence. Not only that, studies show that the more active you are, the more you reduce your risk of another stroke. That’s why our first course focuses on improving your walking. We start with walking further and faster. Then we incorporate strength exercises, focus training, and nutrition tips to support your progress.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL COACH\r\nStrokemark gives you a personal coach to keep you on track.

Sometimes the word order or choice of words in sentences seems other than standard English usage, making one wonder where this app is created and if it's edited.",

            "I paid for the full app since it seems the most like the one my daughters speech therapist uses with her. I could be great if it acually worked but it seems as if it did not fully download. I only have maybe 1 out of every 10 pictures on the flashcards. Most videos do not seem to be available. PLEASE FIX!! Ok so after reading other reviews I uninstalled and reinstalled app. Works fantastic now. Would be helpful if they would mention that this seems to be necessary for app to work properly.",
            "It would be great. But I purchased the full version and 60% of the flashcards are blank and say error when you tap them. Memory match freezes a lot Not worth the $20 Also individual letter sounds would be amazing",
            "I would give this app 0 stars if I could, this is a rip-off, be very aware of the \"sale\" it makes you think you are unlocking all the letters for 19 dollars and some change but they only unlock one letter, so if you want to unlock all the alphabet be really to spend OVER $500 dollars, they got me with almost 20 dollars so I'm wondering how many more people are like me falling for it.",
            "Highly recommend. I have used this app both for helping with articulation speech therapy and for kindergarten phonics with my son. It was invaluable in both instances. It is comprehensive and easy to use. Thanks for a great app!",
            "I wish I knew how to get a refund. It isn't child friendly. You can't count on the glad cards having sound, which is the important part. More time was spent trying to get card to read themselves, than actually using the app as meant too."

            "An absolutely wonderful program. I purchased it for supplemental speech therapy for my wife who had a severe stroke, which seriously effected her ability to speak and recognize written words. The flexibility of this program is perfect. She can choose to hear and see descriptive cue words simultaneously. This alone has advanced her skills 10 fold ! Not to mention her favorite part, which is adding her own favorite photos along with text and auditory cues ! Outstanding feature ! She absolutely loves the program and how it empowers her to work at her leisure, focusing on the skills which she needs, but cannot fit into the 2 Speech therapy sessions allowed weekly. I highly recommend this app. For the price, we couldn't be happier.",

            "Wont open comes to a page saying not found then loops back to google play Update contacted Google for refund, Google said contact developer. Developer says contact google. Thanks for the run around on an expensive non working app.",
            "Very supportive and responsive support. App has an easy to use UI for communication and seems to be quite customizable. The PIN function to restrict changes to settings is very useful. It does install all images locally but that also allows the app full functionality even when not connected to the internet. The app comes with multiple different page layouts on installation, and has the ability to create custom pages as well. However, I did have to explore myself the various settings and options available in the app, and how they changed the functionality and interface of the app. The degree of customization is great, such as custom buttons with personal images and sound recordings for true personalization of expression but these options can feel a little overwhelming for those that are unfamiliar with AAC apps or communication apps in general. Some sort of in app onboarding to help new users customize the app to their communication needs where new users can view the default page types/layouts easily when they first start the app, and a help/guide function or library explaining the different options available to users as far as customization and control goes would be very helpful. If there is a manual included in the application, it is not easily located. Otherwise, this app suits our needs perfectly, and I would definitely recommend this app.",
            "Wonderful speech app and incredible customer service. We've been using Proloquo2go for years and with each new version it is increasingly difficult to use, NO customer support in the US, and is so ridiculously expensive. Our school recommended TalkTablet and we are so much happier now. It has been a breath of fresh air. So much easier and more intuitive to use. No comparison. And the fellow we called at TalkTablet with some questions, before and after purchasing was outstanding 5*",
            "I am a community support worker who supports many people with speech difficulties of different types. This app is by far the best app in versatility, usability, and price. Customer support is the best that I've found, you accually get to talk to a real person if there are any questions which have been far and few in between do to the extreme user friendliness of this app. I can't say enough good things about the creater of this program, it has changed many people's lives.

            "I paid for the full app since it seems the most like the one my daughters speech therapist uses with her. I could be great if it acually worked but it seems as if it did not fully download. I only have maybe 1 out of every 10 pictures on the flashcards. Most videos do not seem to be available. PLEASE FIX!! Ok so after reading other reviews I uninstalled and reinstalled app. Works fantastic now. Would be helpful if they would mention that this seems to be necessary for app to work properly.",
            "It would be great. But I purchased the full version and 60% of the flashcards are blank and say error when you tap them. Memory match freezes a lot Not worth the $20 Also individual letter sounds would be amazing",
            "I would give this app 0 stars if I could, this is a rip-off, be very aware of the \"sale\" it makes you think you are unlocking all the letters for 19 dollars and some change but they only unlock one letter, so if you want to unlock all the alphabet be really to spend OVER $500 dollars, they got me with almost 20 dollars so I'm wondering how many more people are like me falling for it.",
            "Highly recommend. I have used this app both for helping with articulation speech therapy and for kindergarten phonics with my son. It was invaluable in both instances. It is comprehensive and easy to use. Thanks for a great app!",
            "I wish I knew how to get a refund. It isn't child friendly. You can't count on the glad cards having sound, which is the important part. More time was spent trying to get card to read themselves, than actually using the app as meant too."

            "It is a good app but I am upset because I was charged for months after the trial ended. I thought I had canceled the subscription on the app itself. When I finally realized I was being charged $37 US per month I figured out how to canc it through Google but was told there is a no refund policy. I did not use the app after the trial period and think I should get my money back. Apps make it easy to use but difficult if you are trying to unsubscribe or cancel.",
            "I believe the best feature of this help is the videos of kids are actually kids. They don’t sound bossy as an adult would seem to a kid with autism. Since they’re peers to my daughter, she gets encouraged to imitate them and learn from them. We’ve seen the improvement in weeks. She sounds better day by day and the app is obviously beneficial but also fun at the same time enough to keep her focused without feeling like lectured."

Get unlimited practice with categories in one versatile speech therapy app.\r\n\r\nWhen you struggle with categories due to stroke, brain injury, or autism, simple tasks like finding the right supermarket aisle or choosing a word can be impossible. But what if there was a way to heal these broken networks of meaning? To put the things in your brain back where they belong?\r\n\r\nGet Category Therapy, an app designed for both speech-language pathologists and home users to help restructure the brain and let the ideas flow.\r\n\r\n• Take control with evidence-based exercises designed by experts\r\n• Improve word-finding and sorting skills with 4 engaging activities and unlimited practice\r\n• Get an app that works in both home and clinical settings\r\n• Interact with clear photos and a simple interface that's easy for everyone to use\r\n• Adjust settings to target your goals and suit your needs\r\n• Use e-mailed reports and customization to seamlessly fit the app into your therapy program\r\n\r\nDownload Category Therapy Lite for FREE to see how it can help!\r\n\r\nWhen you lose the ability to group items and identify what they have in common, it gets in the way of your ability to understand, learn, and communicate. But with the right kind of practice, it’s possible to strengthen the connections between words and concepts and navigate your world more easily.\r\n\r\nGet the right activity – for every brain.\r\n\r\nNo two people are the same. With 4 activities ranging from simple to complex, there's something in Category Therapy to match your needs. Work through them gradually or focus on the activity that best suits your needs.\r\n\r\n1) Find: Start with the basics. You'll hear and see a photo of a category (let's say \"Fruit\"). Tap the item that matches (for example, a banana).\r\n\r\n2) Classify: Switch it up. Now you start with an item and choose the category that matches. This tests your ability to apply categories to what you see.\r\n\r\n3) Exclude: Challenge yourself. By choosing an item that doesn't belong, you learn how to independently identify categories. As things get harder, you can always tap Hint for some help.\r\n\r\n4) Add One: Train yourself to recognize common features of items – to categorize them – and then choose one item that fits the category you’ve identified.\r\n\r\nWhen you're done, share your progress. The app makes it easy to quickly send detailed reports to a therapist or loved one.\r\n\r\nGet every feature you need in one easy app.\r\n\r\n• 70 categories and nearly 700 words in one package\r\n• 3 difficulty levels ranging from simple objects to more abstract concepts\r\n• Great for aphasia, brain injury, autism, and other cognitive & language impairments\r\n• Switch to Pictures Only to practice naming or Words Only to practice reading\r\n• Customize number of trials, choices, and more – it’s yours to control\r\n• Designed with adults in mind but easy enough for children to use \r\n• No subscriptions, no monthly bills, no Wi-Fi needed\r\n\r\nThere’s hope. With Category Therapy in your corner, you can build stronger connections between words – and learn to speak and think more easily.\r\n\r\nDownload now to get started – or try it for FREE with Category Therapy Lite!\r\n\r\nLooking for something different in a speech therapy app?

Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3).

To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered.

It is completely malleable, and it addresses all levels of\r\nmemory, knowledge, comprehension, reading, and writing.  From a child stricken with\r\nlow-functioning autism, to a senior citizen who has had a stroke and now suffers from\r\naphasia, to someone who has had a tracheotomy or laryngectomy, to someone suffering\r\nfrom MS, Cerebral Palsy, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, brain trauma or legions, or to a person with\r\ndeafness or muteness who wants a convenient way to communicate with people who don’t\r\nknow sign language, VOCALYX can be a life changing tool to those who need it.\r\n \r\nIn short, VOCALYX can compensate for three types of speech problems: vocalization\r\n(for example in the case of throat cancer), language (as is the case for aphasics), and\r\ncommunication (in the case of autism). The principle is simple: you click on an image (a\r\nphoto, pictogram, or text box) within a premade or personalized keyboard, and VOCALYX\r\nsays the message for you through the use of voice synthesis, or with the recorded voice\r\nof either the user or someone close to him/her.\r\n \r\nThe parameters are 100% customizable to meet the needs of all our individual users. This\r\nincludes: the size and number of buttons displayed, the length of button presses (useful\r\nfor people who tremble because of Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s, or MS for example), the\r\nsynthetic voice (age, gender, speed), and there are several different forms of visual\r\ncommunication.\r\n \r\nThere are keyboards made up of pictograms, photos, and prewritten phrases, as well as\r\nABCD and QWERTY keyboards. When using the pictogram and photo keyboards, you have\r\nthe option of either using the images we have already provided and organized, uploading\r\nyour own personal images, or searching through photo and pictogram databases, like\r\nARASAAC, MAKATON, or PECS, and downloading a wide selection of images.\r\n \r\nAn internet connection is not required to use VOCALYX, except during the registration\r\nand the initial set up. It is usable in all situations and any normal place one would go on a\r\ndaily basis. Take advantage of the free trial and discover how much this AAC tool can help\r\nyou or someone you love!  When the free trial is over, you can buy VOCALYX per number of\r\nclicks, or as a 1-time final purchase.\r\n \r\nVOCALYX Features Summary List:\r\n— Free trial available!\r\n— Pay by number of clicks or as a 1-time final purchase\r\n— Fully mobile, VOCALYX can be used anywhere\r\n— Adaptable to all needs\r\n\r\n— Rehabilitation tool with a speech therapy team\r\n— Adaptable synthetic voice (age, gender, speed of speech)\r\n— Record personalized voice messages\r\n— Use personal photos or choose from photos and pictograms offered through the app\r\n— 1000 pre-programmed messages for helping communication\r\n— 800 images and 1200 pictograms available to meet individual needs\r\n— Create your own messages\r\n— QWERTY keyboard with word predict\r\n— An unlimited number of personalized messages\r\n— Combine the use of photos, pictograms, and phrases to send texts/SMS or emails\r\n— Display settings are customizable (button size, number of images shown on each page)\r\n— Share your exercises with your speech therapist",

These problems range from balance issues to arm or leg paralysis. As a result, about 40 percent of stroke survivors have serious falls within a year of their strokes. But, there is good news. Rehab therapy along with regular exercise may improve your balance and ability to move.\r\nThe most common physical effect of stroke is muscle weakness. Survivors often work with therapists to restore muscle strength through exercise programs. They also learn skills to deal with the loss of certain body movements.\r\nThe post stroke exercise mobile app illustrates exercise programs \r\nadapted from National Stroke Association. The app features exercises in video animation format along with easy to follow steps, thus offers an unique experience and excellent visual communication tool. Moreover these exercises are presented in 11 regional languages.\r\n\r\nThere are two exercise programs illustrated in the apps. The first is for the person whose physical abilities have been mildly affected by the stroke. The second is for those with greater limitations. If you are not sure which one is appropriate, consult the profile that precedes each program.\r\nAs with any exercise program, consult with your doctor and/or therapist before beginning this program. If any exercises are too difficult and cause pain or increase stiffness in your limbs, do not do them.",

            "I have been trying to contact the developer because I did not want to renew, and I lost my phone during the 3 days prior to the renewal date. When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",
            "It's great app for special child..but it's much costy to compare to other apps.if a possible prodive some more discount for monthly payment.....",
            "This program is absolutely amazing. I swear they have to be hypnotizing or drugging my little guy the way he calms down excitedly when its otsimo time..🤔 Im gonna need to get a lifetime license",
            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",

            "We've been trying for a while, but my 2.5 year old is not interested in trying to repeat the words. I'll likely cancel after the first year. Suggestion for the app developers: In the activities where the kids are teaching a new word, you should add a picture of the item in the corner of the screen while the kids say it. Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",
            "Kept seeing ads for this, so I downloaded it! Started the free trial before I decided to buy a subscription, and so glad I did! I couldn't even get a single activity done. There was no sound, the screen kept freezing and the app keeps force closing. Waste of time.",
            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",

        "description": "Sometimes just giving a hint or context is all your listener needs to understand you. The first letter or two. The general topic. AlphaTopics is the perfect AAC app for people whose natural speech is not always clear. \r\n\r\nStop wasting time navigating to the right word or typing it out. Get your point across faster by touching just the first few letters of the words you say. Give your listener context by starting the conversation with the topic. Write it out with your finger or draw a picture. Don’t let overly complicated apps slow you down. \r\n\r\nTactus Therapy, a trusted name in speech therapy apps, brings you a new take on a classic communication tool.  AlphaTopics includes 3 AAC communication boards loaded with features:\r\n\r\n1) Letter Board\r\n- 26 letters in alphabetical order or 2 variations of frequency order\r\n- 10 single digits allow you to express any number \r\n- Vowels highlighted and aligned for faster navigation\r\n- Natural or automated speech reads out the name of each letter or number\r\n- Yes, no, question, smiley, space, and backspace buttons for prosody and function\r\n\r\n2) Topic Board \r\n- Fully customizable text you can re-order \r\n- Voice output with adjustable speech rate\r\n- Two sizes of grid to display 12 or 24 topics\r\n- Pre-filled with functional topics for adults\r\n\r\n3) Whiteboard\r\n- Write or draw on the screen\r\n- 6 colors and 4 widths\r\n- Export to Photos or e-mail\r\n\r\nWhen used together, alphabet and topic boards have been scientifically shown to make the speech of people with motor speech disorders far more understandable. Combined with the whiteboard, these tools help people with aphasia express themselves more clearly with self-cueing and strategy use.\r\n\r\nStroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and motor neuron disease are all conditions that can impair speech production.\r\n\r\nPointing to the first letter in each word not only gives the listener more information about the word, it also encourages the speaker to slow down and separate words, actually making the words clearer! Using alphabet supplementation, studies show intelligibility of sentences improves 25% on average.\r\n\r\nPointing to the topic before speaking narrows the range of possibilities for the listener, giving context. Studies show using a topic cue improves word understanding by an average of 28%. Topics can also be used by people with aphasia, a language disorder, to help pinpoint the intended message.\r\n\r\nAdditional Features:\r\n* Adjustable settings for visual, physical, language, and cognitive impairments\r\n* Works with built-in scanning and guided access\r\n* 4 color schemes\r\n* Pick which board comes up when you start the app\r\n* Export any board you've customized to print or share\r\n\r\nVisit tactustherapy.com for more information on how to use this app, the evidence to support this form of AAC, and a day-by-day account of how this app was made.\r\n\r\nLooking for something different in a speech therapy app?

            "The games are very challenging (to me anyway). If I am upset I get such a positive distraction from playing the Lumosity games. My memory has been greatly improved and it seems to have caused me to feel more positive and upbeat. The people who created these games well I could only wish to have such genius. Thank you very much. Cachal Teagues",
            "I've had this app for 10 years and this is a fun app when it comes to brain games. it does make you think and really makes you try to beat your timing when doing different games on here the only thing, I don't like is that you have to pay to do a different game if you want to do that differently daily or you have to wait daily for the games to change that's the only thing that sucks on here but all the games are fun. I love coffee game on here and I love the train game, super fun for the brain.",
            "I am very much enjoying myself....some are easy and some are more difficult.l think there could be a bit more extensive instruction with some of the puzzles.",
            "Pretty good, but the probably quiz is providing WRONG answer. It also doesn't accept equivalent answers. Looks like they don't care to fix the game that gives really WRONG results.",
            "Very well planned and paced puzzles, games, mind enhancing and training app. Very useful for people above 45 and those who are at risk of alzheimer disease."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

I have been hoping for something like this- so people would not patronize me, put words in my mouth or keep ending up with bills I didn't want or should have to pay.  Tired of the taken advantage of and hopefully this being passed around inner circle will help with their disgusting behavior.  Very excited!  I literally am getting a voice again that doesn't get \"episodes\" & again has clout to pull. :-D",

The app contains over 1000 exercises prepared by highly qualified physiotherapists, thanks to which each set of exercises is carefully prepared for both beginners and advanced. Rephysio will guide you through all the exercises with detailed video instructions on how to perform them.\r\n\r\nThe best features of the app:\r\n\r\n• Over 1000 dedicated exercises\r\n• 14 rehabilitation categories\r\n• Individual consultations and therapies\r\n• Tailored exercise schedule\r\n• Tracking exercise status\r\n• Levels of session advancement\r\n• Video instruction for each exercise\r\n• Detailed information about exercises\r\n• Tips for treating the condition\r\n• Multilingual\r\n• Dark theme\r\n\r\nIn addition to the basic categories - in the app you can also order a special dedicated individual plan created only for the person ordering. Ordering such a plan gives us the opportunity to consult in the form of a live chat with a physiotherapist - who, based on our guidelines, diseases and recommendations, will create for you a consultation or a dedicated exercise plan.\r\n\r\nBasic categories of rehabilitation:\r\n\r\n• Obesity\r\n• Lumbar spine\r\n• Neck spine\r\n• Round back\r\n• Flat backs\r\n• Senior's zone\r\n• Upper limbs\r\n• Lower limbs\r\n• Parkinson's disease\r\n• Dysartria\r\n• Aphasia\r\n• Stroke\r\n• Multiple sclerosis\r\n• Facial nerve palsy\r\n\r\nAll categories are divided into sets and then into sessions. Each session has a specific level of exercise, according to a specially prepared rehabilitation program. If any set or session is a problem, you should consult the exercises with your physiotherapists.\r\n\r\nThe app tracks the progress of rehabilitation and automatically saves the last state of the exercise so that the next time you start the app, you can easily go to the last saved exercise. Thanks to this, you don't have to worry about accidentally closing the app or unloading your device.\r\n\r\nEach exercise contains a detailed description of how to perform them, the number of repetitions and series, as well as the necessary information about the best place to perform and the necessary equipment, such as a skipping rope or exercise mat.\r\n\r\nRephysio has several languages, which is why the app adapts to the patient. A reminder of a session or exercise on different days of the week will allow you to tailor the app to your individual exercise preferences.\r\n\r\nNot everyone likes the bright theme of the app, so we have introduced an amazing black theme, thanks to which we save battery and eyesight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTerms and Conditions:\r\nhttps://re-physio.com/terms-and-conditions\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy:\r\nhttps://re-physio.com/privacy-policy\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMedical Disclaimer\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease seek a doctor's advice in addition to using this app, and before making any medical decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advice given by this app does not replace the opinion of a medical professional and need to seek the advice of a physiotherapist or doctor in addition to using the app before making any final decisions.

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: K is an all inclusive app that teaches you how to say K and then how to teach and cue your child how to say the sound. We will then walk you through how to systematically practice K in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say K correctly in the word \"cave\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices K by saying \"kick\" while playing soccer, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say K\r\n~Tips on how to teach K to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say K and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say K correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online K flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying K\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on K for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for K even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

Human language is incredibly complex. Neuroscientists are just now beginning to discover all the ways in which language has re-wired the human brain, enabling us to communicate in a way that no other animal can. That requires a whole new set of connections deep in the brain between areas that aren’t connected in other animals; it means fine coordination of the small muscles of the lips, jaw, throat, and chest; and it means being able to think and speak all at breathtaking speed.\r\n\r\nBut all that complexity comes with a price: if anything goes wrong in the many biological pathways that produce language, then speech becomes impossible. That’s why speech pathology is such an important specialty. Speech pathologists have to understand all the different parts that go into allowing a human being to speak, and have to be able to diagnose when one of these parts is malfunctioning.

            "I was enjoying the app until I tried to play with the puzzle game. There is a problem with moving the pieces in to place. I could not get them to. move. It was like they were stuck to my screen. No matter; how hard I pushed, nothing moved. Most annoying; also as I got up to 7 and higher my scores went down and by accident I solved your problems. I turned my phone upside down and the pieces would move where I wanted them to go. My score should have been high and no negative reply.",
            "Too many ads that play too long! This app is marketed for seniors, but some of the ads are not. Also, the app should have some \"helps.\" I'm stuck on an upper level of a puzzle game and can't advance or do anything because I can't solve the puzzle. Ready to uninstall this app.",
            "Every (often less than 30 seconds) a 30 second advertising clip even for the very first level does not give one the chance to give the game a reasonable try if it would be worth buying. (-2 stars) Make at least the first 4-5 levels of each game ad-free so people could test the app. Another star lost to directly sending the users to the app-store / installers, very bad for an app targeting also children. Last point: Am I lost, or is there nowhere an exit-button?",
            "The games are challenging but who can be bothered when your screen is taken over by a long time after a very short time of play. Wordscapes should know that hell will freeze over before I'd download their app. Freeze just like they keep freezing my screen.Uninstalling , I don't recommend this one."

        "description": "Speech Therapy: B\r\nDoes your child have trouble saying B? We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: B is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say B and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice B with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. So, I created a not so shiny app that will actually help your child. In order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say B correctly in the word \"border\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices B while playing and saying \"ball,\" carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say B\r\n~Tips on how to teach B to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online B flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying B\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on B for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying B!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: J is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say J and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice J with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say J correctly in the word \"Jeep\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices J by saying \"juice\" during meals, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say J\r\n~Guide on how to teach J to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online J flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach J to your child.\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying J\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on J for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying J!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

When he/she doesn't say it correctly, it can be frustrating! To ease this frustration and provide parents with all the tools they need, we created Speech Therapy: N. Speech Therapy: N is a comprehensive app designed by an ASHA certified, practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say N and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice N with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say N correctly in the word \"north\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices N by saying \"nighty night\" while playing house, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say N\r\n~Tips on how to teach N to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online N flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying N\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on N for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying N!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

Everything you need to help your child say S correctly starting today is included in this app!\r\n\r\nHow it Works:\r\nThis app is very different than any other app you will find on the market. It is NOT just a simple game where a child practices saying sounds while naming pictures. Instead, this app is a tutorial. You, the parent, will first learn how to say S and then how to teach and cue your child to say S correctly. Next, we walk you through how to systematically practice S at the syllable, word, sentence, and conversational level. We provide game ideas, flashcards, and explanations of what you are doing and why. \r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say S correctly in the word \"snake\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices S by saying \"yes\" while eating at the dinner table, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say S\r\n~Tips on how to teach S to your child\r\n~The difference between lateral and frontal lisps and how this affects practice\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say S and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues on how to help your child say S\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Syllable level practice guide\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Photo Flashcards\r\n~And more!\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect: \r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying S\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on S for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for S even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: F is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say F and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice F with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo I created this not so fancy app to help reach this goal! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say F correctly in the word \"frog\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices F by saying \"fork\" while eating, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say F\r\n~Tips on how to teach F to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online F flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying F\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on F for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying F!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: CH is a comprehensive app that describes how to say CH and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice CH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say CH correctly in the word \"chipmunk\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices CH by saying \"cheeseburger\" while eating dinner, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say CH\r\n~Tips on how to teach CH to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online CH flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning and reading at first. Then, you just have to carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying CH\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on CH for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying CH!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

Many children have difficulty saying it correctly, but don't worry! We are here to help your child today.\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: R is an all inclusive app that teaches you how to say R and then how to teach and cue your child how to say the sound. We will then walk you through how to systematically practice R in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say R correctly in the word \"rake\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices R by saying \"more\" while playing blocks, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say R\r\n~Tips on how to teach R to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say R and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say R correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online R flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying R\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on R for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for R even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

Only thing i wish is that the videos on how to pronounce were still active. thank you for making these my son has many sounds we are working on and having such detailed information for how to form the sounds etc has heen extremely helpful for someone like me who doesnt really think about how i articulate each sound to explain to my son how to move/hold his mouth",

            "There is far too much luck and not enough strategy in this game. One can use the same level balls, lined up on the same dot, pointed in the same direction, on the same alley, use the same swing; and one week you get strikes or 9s. Next week, tons of splits. The flower pin arrangement is a very good example. The game does not reward figuring out strategy. It also does not provide enough opportunities to upgrade balls. It also does a poor job of pairing u against opponents with same ball level.",
            "Fun! All free for me so far. Update: I still really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are incredible and the ways the balls, pins and alleys interact seems to be 100% true to the laws of physics. Sometimes I'll get startled by the ball or pins shooting back in my face or I'll burst out in a laugh when something unexpected happens. This is still one of my go-to games even when I'm losing.",
            "Your game is the best bowling, most realistic and I used to bowl pro. But it freezes up constantly. Its really frustrating when your bowling for 6,000. I've probably lost 15,000 easy. Please fix the freezing! The lower right side still freezes my stick. I like the changes, however, the one u call Rabbit, 2configuration of 5 pins. These games r to challenge yourself.the only way to get a strike is by accident. Please change the one, no fun.",
            "This app is filled with a bunch of bots. The whole system is rigged. What a disappointment. The balls don't get any better. How I know it's rigged and you aren't playing against live players is try and forfeit in the last frame beforeit even begins. Miraculously it shows the other persons score over those 3 frames when there wasn't even enough time to bowl those 3 frames. Rigged!!!",
            "The game is very nice to play, however, when and if you purchase certain items, they don't tell you that if you don't have that particular ball in play you have to WAIT until that ball Opens up for you. Therefore, you purchased something that may not be available to you when you purchase it! So you have to keep playing, just to see your purchased item! NOT GOOD."

        "description": "Two factor authentication (2FA) is easy, convenient, and secure when you use Microsoft Authenticator. Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts. Then, when you sign in, you’ll provide your username and password as usual. Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\r\n\r\nEnroll in our beta program!

            "This app is awesome if you forget your passwords frequently or want to add an extra layer of security.. The downside is if you change your password and do not have another way to verify your account (send a code to email or phone number) then you're locked out. Make sure your contact preferences are set before linking your account! Also I have noticed the app doesn't link a lot of services; just Facebook, Microsoft, and Google accounts. I'd like to see more accounts able to be linked.",
            "Amazing app, I really appreciate how easy it is to backup your information so when U get a New Phone, it is so much easier to reinstall with all your info. Let me say one thing, without that backup, it is a BE'ATCH to get authentication up⬆ & running again with all your compatible apps! It is very Time Consuming without that Great Backup Feature!!! My only downfall, I am having big problems with PayPal... it is Never the right Code... WHY❓ It is driving me insane & it is really a problem for me❗",
            "Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works perfectly for Microsoft accounts, and is acceptable for others. I can't have all the codes showing at once, which means an extra tap each time I go to use the app, and I'd like to be able to customise icons for accounts to make it easier to spot the one I'm after. Other than minor niggles, I'm good.",
            "I have no choice but to use this app for my organization, but recently it began requiring me to \"unlock\" the app. I had no idea how to do this so I had to Google for an answer. Turns out you have to use your mobile PIN or biometric to unlock the app. I feel like my phone PIN has been compromised and provided to Microsoft. Unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the usage reporting that is enabled by default that I discovered when turning off this unlock feature. Sorry Microsoft, I do not trust you.",
            "I recommend this application. It is convenient to keep your account security verification code secure. When you login, it ensure that no one will login to your account without your permission. I also love this app more than google authentication. You can backup your info link with your email. It is very good when compare to other authentication app."

        "comments": [
            "I enjoy the game, the storyline and graphics. Like other have noted, not having stored items count towards your flowers seems odd. It's difficult to get compasses at times to open land - sometimes I have literally played about 1500 in points and got only one compass - particularly when having to play a completed scene over and over to just get enough stars to buy something. Which is another thing - I thought 36000 was a lot, then it was 38000, now 72000! Have to spend a lot of money to advance.",
            "Love the many different aspects of the game...*the 'seek n find to gain points, increasing your coin level so you can *buy (houses, animals...), to increase your PRESTIGE, (the flowers you earn level up), *creating your own island! The *story line, following June from level to level! You don't have to make in app purchases; alternative ways to raise your coins to keep active until you meet your goals! You can also *follow JJ on Facebook!! My favorite game!!!",
            "I like the varied parts to the game- mystery, puzzles, hidden items, building. The characters are realistic, not cartoon-like. I have had no glitches/bugs and the buttons to change scenes work easily. I was a bit confused about game play at the first scene but I went to the information and it became more clear. There are many layers to this game.",
            "The game is fun but I have spent too much money to gain power ups, energy and gems go get farther in the game. The % you win for each seen you play to earn stars isn't equal to how well you play. It only gives you 10% increase when you \"finish\" a \"scene\" even if you get a perfect. If I get a perfect I should be earning more than 8-10% for playing great. Lots of improvements are needed.",
            "I enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (I did find one typo but in this day and age that isn't bad) and the game play enjoyable. It is relaxing for me. I was also very impressed at the quick response to my inquiry about something that was actually me forgetting an aspect of game play about storing items. I had my answer in one day. I honestly wasn't that confident that something like a game maker would be that attentive to my dumb question. Good job!"

            "It's a shame that this game doesn't give you the coins you win. Played the daily challenge for 30 days and won the 200 coins, yet I didn't get them. Tried to contact them but the have no direct message. There is no use playing if you're going to cheat me out of the winnings. Also need to work on the words. There have been many words that you say no that are.....",
            "Great game which is addictive, I play this all the time because it is simple yet fun. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because there is one improvement which would be good to see in this game; and that would be an option to change colours of the block and background. Having played the game more 100s of times, seeing the same colours does make it dull. If this small update was implemented, it would make a huge difference.",
            "I am giving this a low rating because of all the ads and the fact that you can get rid of them for 4 bucks but thats just for 30 days. Seriously???? Also the landscape never changes even though in the ad it showed green grass which looked cool. Shame on you devs. Where are the levels in the pictures and trailer? It's a great game but it's the same thing over amd over again.",
            "Not what was advertised when It was an ad, I saw ad and was like woah that looks like a fun little game so I downloaded quickly without investigating, only to find this completely different game so for that I give a 1star. But it's a fun game so 5 star. DO NOT LIKE BEING TRICKED HOWEVER. Shame on you if you're in control of false advertising. But a fun game so I'm conflicted.",
            "The music is peace allowing you to think ,no time presure,which allows you to relax,and the background pic is beautiful. No ads intrupt while your trying to think.So if you like block puzzles I highly recommed trying this one."

            "I really want to like this app because it has a lot of content. It should be, and was, simple and intuitive. But they keep changing it in ways that actually degrade the customer experience. Click the \"immerse\" button and the wheel spins perpetually. Try the help button and the same thing happens. They are turning what was a good hammer -- a simple, useful tool -- into a bloated, mediocre multitool that does everything -- badly.",
            "You cannot go back and review the sections, like Grammar. Once you have completed a section you lose access to the full learning content even if you pay for a subscription. I was very disappointed with this feature otherwise I found this to be optimal language app compared to other options and I tried several .",
            "Very easy to use app . A very good app . Tons and tons of languages to learn from here . Most important , it is free . Very user friendly app and inexpensive to use on . Highly recommend. Now I know 12 languages but I recommend more click to learn languages pages . ( No typing ) to be exact . A very good way to learn languages .",
            "I could not think of one fault about this app. It is fantastic! So far, I've not had any problems and I've had the app for almost a month now. It is a great way to practice French in the holidays, when I'm not at school as my teachers can set class courses. I've also started learning Italian independently and all the FREE features have definitely helped. You can do so so much and I just wish I could write a longer review because MEMRISE IS INCREDIBLE! So much better than other language apps. ❤️❤",
            "I've used, three of the top language apps. And this, is the fastest, and best way, to learn a langyage that I've seen so far! Great Work!! I can't waiit to get paid, so I can get the upgraded version. I am so excited. I have to learn German fast... What a time for my Direct Deposit ti be messed up, without a payment for 2 months! S.

            "The main qualm i have with this game is how expensive all of the buildings are. I played this game for the longest time and stopped. Now I remember why. Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",

Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

            "App is decent for online meetings. I use it for group meetings as well as one on one collaboration. It is as good as zoom and some of the other platforms out there. I like that you can set the meeting to be open to anyone that has the link. unlike zoom the host doesn't have to add each individual to the meeting and you can also lock the meeting so no one else can get in if it's a private conversation, for instance an appointment with a therapist.",
            "I was a first time user & was originally overwhelmed by all of the different options & directions. Also, I was attempting to use a \"smart\" phone which gave me limited screen usage. I would suggest that there be a test setup & a dummy call for novices; that way we can get practice before our actual conference call. We could also work out any kinks with our equipmemt. UPDATE: 6/17/20 I've used the system frequently over the past month. The system is a good option for those w/limited screen size.",
            "I use this app for group virtual meetings at my government occupation. the app works wonderful, lots of video, audio, quality settings to chose from. my only issue would be that I had a great deal of difficulty initially learning how to join an active group. in fact I missed the first two meetings because I couldn't get it to work, and I am very technically proficient, from building barebones CPUs, html Java cyber security ect, and I still found the login to join meeting process very difficult.",
            "As the parent of student, I've had to learn this app to support my child's education & I have to say, it's pretty decent. It could be a little less glitchy on audio. The video streamed rather smoothly. It wasn't exactly HDMI quality but it wasn't Commadore 64 pixelated either. There was a time delay of a few seconds with audio, that wasn't reflected in the video stream at all, when transitioning but it seemed as tho it would handle a few users at a time when speaking. Overall, very sufficient!",
            "I have used Webex several times and have always been happy with the quality of voice and video. This time specially, there were some delays (5-10 seconds) on what presenter was sharing on his screen with attendees. He could see a new page, but we were still waiting to get it in our screen."

            "Love the app but have a few suggestions to make it even better. Have scheduled todo items show up on the Outlook calendar app; This would be awesome!! Have an option to hide certain lists from \"my day\". I have some lists I use as filler projects when there's free time and I don't want them taking priority over other necessary items I haven't scheduled yet. Thank you for a great app thus far!",
            "For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, \"tomorrow\" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap \"remind me in half an hour\" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",
            "Redudant and limiting. There should be a way to share specific lists, but keep some private-a \"Honey-Do\"list; to be able to schedule minders for the 3rd level items and further break down tasks; to be able to reorder 3rd level sending completed to bottom; to be able to prioritize which list I want at the top and if I don't use Important, Planned, Tasks, then I want to move it down and pin what I want on top; to be able to set custom alarms, not notifications, for very important things...",
            "Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",
            "Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an \"assigned to me\" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating."

            "Best Way strategy game I would give it 5 stars, if not for this few things I wish the developer would add very soon 1. A way to vote out a clan leader: some leaders can't access their game accounts anymore. So they begin afresh, but resuming their leadership role becomes impossible, so they and clan members are force to abandoned clan cos of inactive leader. Please make it easier to change leaderships in clans to save clans 2. Please include clan battles and gold sharing. Thanks",
            "I like the game but if you could just buy the game and pay for updates i think i would spend money. The way its set up its like a never ending nickle and diming. And whoever pays gets more advantages which isnt really strategic so much as pay to win. Also, i feel like im playing a computer many times even when it says im playing wifth or against another person... i dont know. Also, it doesnt take much strategy for someone to sit in their base and develop a nuke (sPaCe StRiKe) and just blow U up",
            "Great game once you get to level 7 where skirmishes are avaliable this game is a real rts but its not for a casual player as game play is slow do you need time to invest. This is a pay to win and things are expensive but you can also invest time and get the things another (research) production queue would be great devs also but please don't miss out on this game its very good once you get into it. Thanks",
            "Game doesn't load after its open, I am done waiting and unsitalling it right now. I used to love this game a lot but now this issue has killed the vibe, i would appreciate the developer team to fix it as soon as possible. Really want to play it again Just because of this issue i have given it 1 star",
            "The game is good and the graphics also.. but for now i just give a 4 star.. i wish that you can fix a minor problem that i encounter like sometimes the troops dont know where to go when i ordered them.. they just walking to somewhere dead end area."

            "My favorite game, I literally deleted my other games because this is the only one I play now, I love it so much. Everything from how positive it is, to the perfectly fitting audio that plays. I love how simple and easy going this game is and I love how this games helps you succeed. The levels where you can locate items are super fun as well, recommending this game to everyone I know literally!!",
            "Caution. This game is really nicely crafted, very visually rich, and enjoyable to play from levels 1-10. After this, things start to go absolutely mental. There is pop-up after pop-up, harassing you about another new feature. You quickly get to a point where you're bamboozled - everything on the screen is shouting at you. This appears to be by design, hyper confusion and attention hijacking to nurture addiction. This app is nefarious and should be enjoyed only with huge restraint.",
            "Never log into Facebook. It causes you to lose the prizes from any contest you won. I had tons of things coming from a dots race and they vanished the second it connected to Facebook. Also, the game freezes and crashes a lot when watching videos to get a bonus box. You have to be patient when you open the app. It can take over five minutes to come up.",
            "Honestly was obsessed with this game for awhile, but they made a bunch of updates and now every time you view the map about four or five different windows pop up to tell you about the different games. It used to just be the daily bonus. Tired of exiting out of a bunch of stupid notifications just to be able to click on the game I want. They ruined a good thing.",
            "You get to a certain point and you can't win anything without spending money. With prices on everything else in life steadily increasing the last thing I wanna spend money on is a silly phone game. If you could just spend money once or twice, maybe no big deal. But you have to constantly spend money to get perks to help you thru the levels and clearly this is by design. It's a really cool game, and very disappointing to have to delete, but I'm just not up for money hungry games like this."

            "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love the various types of games. There's so much to play and the puzzles beyond scrabble are fun. I hate the implementation of ads. There's so many! I could cope if they all had the same format, but these fullscreen ads all have the 'X' in different places. I find the interface too cluttered, bright and confusing. There's too much going on and it makes it difficult to navigate. The animations for rewards are too long and frequent. Get rid!",
            "The game itself is fine. Works well etc. However, it seems to be a meet up place for middle aged to senior men. They all start out polite, how are you etc but within a few exchanges, they want you to go on WhatsApp or hangouts. Some of us would just like to play Scrabble! I seriously have turned down, at least, 15 to 20 men. It's not a dating app.",
            "This game is vile and takes away from the true spirit of scrabble. Players cheat by using hints which they are pathetic enough to pay for. You cant progress in the mini games without paying. The graphics are an eyesore, the adverts are constant (unless youre willing to pay of course). The 'Bots' who im guessing dont have an agenda, as they aren't real people can take ages to take their turn. This game is a disgrace and does not encourage people to use their own minds, to learn or play for free.",
            "This game is a fun way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating at times. I tap on the \"swap tiles\" icon because I had about 4 letters that were the same. I look at an ad (I don't want to see) so that I can swap out my tiles, and they literally give me back the same exact tiles I had before. This is the 3rd time this has happened. Also, they don't allow us to use all the words in the dictionary. I know we cant use proper nouns, but there are other words we should be able to use.",
            "I love playing Scrabble. It's a lot of fun. The reviews are right there are tons of ads. Most of them are 5 seconds. And you can choose longer ones to get more rewards sometimes. There's a chat feature that can be fun when talking to friends. Or maybe people who you played a lot of games with already. But there are a lot of people that are scammers that are trying to chat. And when you realize that and try to end a game with them it wrecks your winning streak."

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",
            "Perfect Mix of Mobile Security & Antivirus Combo For Galaxy Note 4 Running On Android 6.0.1 Everything seems to run well with no issues. I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.👈",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

            "I like that it tells you if you have the wrong letter and if you get stuck you can ask for a letter. The questions are general knowledge. Another app had their puzzles according to different subjects so if you didn't know anything about that particular subject you were lost. The easy ones are hard enough for me but I like that you have a choice for people that might be more skilled in crosswords. (Smarter than I am!)",
            "Update: Some of the Clues & Answers seem to be aimed at the \"boomer\" generation and the C&A's are repeated often. It's still a great crossword game, It's a simple design, user friendly, it costs nothing to use hints. Which is great for anyone who wants to unwind. Not everyone knows who the star of \"touched by an angel\" is. And that's ok! You don't need to know. Use the hints that don't require you to watch ads, spend coins, wait (X amount) time or cost you money. Be free & relax 😊",
            "Used to be great, but now ads are too intrusive. Before, a simple silent ad would pop up and you could tap through it. Fairly low annoyance factor. Now, massive full-screen ads with obnoxiously loud audio FORCE you to watch videos for games you don't want. The frequency of the ads has increased too. The game is great otherwise, with a solid easy interface and good features. Used to be a lot of fun but I am sadly going to have to uninstall."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Does not give immediate notifications of arrival and departures because the app remains \"inactive\" and only checks every 30 minutes to save battery; except for the GPS which stays active. At least that's the way support explains it. - The daughter of my wife's friend recently had a wreck in the middle of the night. Life 360's crash detection failed to alert her family. She miraculously survived and phoned home for help. So, we know we can not depend on Life 360 for crash alerts.",
            "Love this app! I've had this for a couple of years now (or so). It's proven really useful! I went on a night out a few months ago and I didn't realise that I lost my phone until morning after! I was distraught!! Luckily, my other half was able to pinpoint the location of my mobile using Life360 and we were able to track and find my phone! Life360 is a lifesaver!",
            "Love the app. Been using it for a year or so, and very happy, but it suddenly decided to quit locating my wife - dementia issues. Note says \"End of free history - Free History is only good for two days of history - all I'm looking for is the last couple of hours. That doesn't seem to translate to \"the app has quit working\", but it seems that's exactly what is happening. The app continues to work fine for MY phone. Very disappointed!",
            "My family has been using this app for years and never had an issue until recently. No body is getting notifications for anything, ie: driving, low battery or arriving/leaving places. This is absolutely unacceptable especially for a \"safety\" app. You guys should stick to the basics with tracking and stop with all the extra bells & whistles.",
            "The app is great for keeping track of your loved ones. We've used (for example) to locate our son, who was running cross country at an event and we weren't sure where the park was. We pulled up the app and used the directions to him. It was very helpful. We've used it to see if our college age son has left his apartment to head home and estimate when he'll arrive."

            "I don't want any headers or footers on any of my documents, so I have to manually go into every document individually to remove them because there's no general setting for this - extremely inconvenient. Also, this can only be done via desktop, as even individual doc removal of headers/footers isn't an option via app - another extreme inconvenience. And when I change the font, the doc has to be refreshed in order for it to reflect the new font. Much inconvenience.",
            "Love it. You can write tons of things. And documents never deletes unless you deleted them. 2 suggestions though. Can you make it so of your writing a story to have the option to have book pages that you can adjust the size cuz im writing a story and i wud LOVE that option. Also not just for storys but for essays and stuff. Would be great for printing 2 so you know size of page. Also have spelling corrections. Thanks google!!",
            "Very unfortunate to repot that 'Docs have stopped unexpectedly. Report this issue to help us determine what went wrong' popping up frequently and even the reporting page is not opening. It was so friendly earlier.",
            "Thank you SOOOO much for adding a dark theme setting! I'm a writer and sometimes I have to stop because the bright white screen hurts my head, but the dark theme setting makes things a lot easier for me and many others. ♡",
            "I like it but for the life of me I can't find out how to change the settings for sharing documents. Now whenever I want to share a document it goes automatically to Gmail, and I don't want that. There doesn't seem to be anyway in the app to change that."

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

        "comments": [
            "Been playing this game for a couple of months now and still enjoying it. Ads are very short and do not interrupt gameplay. You can also opt for the ad free version. I personally especially like the challenge levels and the opportunity to watch full ads in order to earn rotations which can be saved and help loads if there are no suitable spaces left. A great game. No complaints at all 🏆",
            "Love the game! However, to earn extra rotators you have to watch commercials. Sometimes many many commercials. The commercials are redundant. Based on your online searches, the commercials are geared to your interests. But if you enjoy watching American Girl 5 maybe 10 times in a row, this might be the game for you. They also offer different wood block games and show you those commercials over and over and over again. You would think if they would be a little creative.",
            "Great gamec- I initially liked this game. At first you could get a free rotator every 5 minutes plus a 30 second ad. Now I have to wait for a free rotator every 24 hours. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. I am part of a group of people who download games, test them, and grade them and pass our comments to them who then pass the recommendations on to everybody in the group and then we pass them on to our friends and family. I do not recommend this game in any way whatsoever.",
            "I Love Puzzles!!! Been playing this game for about a year or so and it's always fun and challenging. I enjoy a challenge with games like this! I will continue playing it. Happy to see the feature added of being able to rotate the piece to fit where you want it. Cool! Thanks!! Continue with enhancing the app to be even greater! 🙂",
            "Rubbish app, spent more time restarting app than playing it. The first few days it was fine but as I ran out of rotates I watched a couple of ad's, to get some more, the app never worked correctly after that. It just kept freezing up. Was fun to play but since there are several versions I might try another block game"

Sub tasks should show their parent in \"Next 7 Days\" and \"Today\", this would be super powerful for splitting a task over several days, it would be a game changer for me!",

Edit: this feature has indeed been fixed, however I can't raise the score because what drove me here was another bug/update. It seems that my tasks/items aren't visible on the widget. I tried a restart and everything. You can still interact with them, but the widget is just a white blank canvas where tasks should be.",
            "Been using for years, and it worked great until 1 day ago. Lists using widgets on Android all have white text on white background now... So obviously unusable. Must have been in an update as multiple Android users are experiencing the same in the last couple of days.",
            "I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",
            "Just downloaded the latest update, to find everything on the widget completely clear. All my project lists gone ! Luckily it's all still within todoist but not on the widget. Still nothing after deleting and setting the widget back up. Looks like I'll have to use the icon again !"

I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad.

Edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star. I can no longer log in, it says \"failed to login, this is taking longer than expected, try again later\" I have uninstalled, turned off my phone, everything. Nothing works and I cannot log in. Deleted app now.",
            "I rarely get notifications of a new message. Messages are left on \"S\" despite having perfect cullar and wifi connection on both ends. Kin market no longer updates. Ads are flashy and painful to the eyes. You should leave ads out of the chats or try to minimize them. Edit: Oct. 21 2020// The app has worsened. I no longer get notifications unless the app is open and running. If I open another app, I.e Tiktok, KIK will cease to retrieve and deliver messages. Kik is dead.",
            "Good if you know what your looking for in an existing group chat or want too make your own. The bots are annoying but there are ways that you can add a bot to remove most bots upon them joining (sounds counter productive but it isn't). I think this app could be improved with an expanded search for typing key words, better storage clearing instead of having to uninstall and reinstall the app, and bringing back of the video calling. The random chat thing is pointless too me, an ok app all around.",

I deleted the data, i deleted the app and reinstalled and still its not working and it keeps saying chat limit blah blah and i cant chat with random people or i cant even join gc. I really miss the old version. Posting my review here is my last option bc you guys dont even answer Emails.",

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: D is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say D and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice D with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nThis app will help reach this goal! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say D correctly in the word \"donkey\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices D by saying \"draw\" while coloring, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say D\r\n~Guide on how to teach D to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online D flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach D to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying D\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on D for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying D!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",
            "When people call, it goes straight to voice-mail. Even tho I have answered the call. They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them. I will never use this service again."

            "This used to be a decent feature of pixels but now it is so convoluted that it's just a nuisance. It doesn't recognize my voice EVER, not even if I prompt it by swiping. Sometimes it pops up randomly when I'm driving and then it still gets nothing. Microphone issue? Doubtful. Also when it pops up on the bottom it covers the keyboard lol great! The list of negatives goes on and on. Why do I need to \"train\" my google assistant every 2 weeks when it's constantly listening to me anyway? Garbage app.",
            "It's an amazing thing; to have this kind of technology readily available at all times, on a personalized level, and small enough to fit in your pocket... for free. However, Google Now was far superior in functionality. Not sure why the step backwards in this seemingly mandatory \"upgrade\", but regardless, it's pretty amazing. I use \"Ok, Google\" probably 10-15 times a day for all sorts of things. It can even answer some two-part questions, and handles most tasks without the need to intervene.",
            "Yes I have numerous suggestions: 1) is for it to read what I ask it to specifically any text message, new or old. 2). If I'm driving down the road and I ask it to tell me something or read the entire paragraph or whatever I don't want it to stop I wanted to recognize that I'm driving and it needs to tell me that it ignores what I'm asking. 3). It would be nice to refine searches previous ones and edit them. 4). More interactive follow-on conversation option. 5,). Able to diagnose, troubleshoot",
            "This used to be a great app but just recently it stopped working at very random times. For example if I ask \"Show me a picture of Mark Hamill\" it will respond with \"Sorry. I don't understand.\" Also, I use the voice feature all the time and the app has stopped hearing my voice (not all the time but again very randomly). Since I use the app frequently, this has become really annoying. At this point, it's about 50% unusable right now, so if you could fix these issues it would be great.",
            "I'm not entirely sure what's wrong but I've trained it a couple times and it still doesn't respond to me but if I use voice search and Google reads a paragraph to me from the web and it happens to have \"OK Google\" or \"hey Google\" in it, it responds. my voice does not at all sound like the default voice that it uses to read, but it still responds regardless. that's the only time I can get it to respond usually."

            "Great App it works in the background and this appears to be done randomly. I say that because every so often I will get a report on my phone stating the number of Apps which are safe. Last report I had 518 Apps I didn't realise I had that many Apps! I feel secure with Lookout running in the background and you can do a manual scan whenever you want to. All this is free unless you want to go one better with Lookout Premium. I have thought about maybe moving to Lookout Premium with all the scams.",
            "Constantly crashes. Please do something about this. I have sent many feesback reports and still no help. I really like the app but i dont want to waste my money and time on an app that does not work. I also think someone is monitoring my phone and I can not receive messages from certain people. Please help. Update Oct. 30, 2020:: When I tried to go to the link you gave me, I was redirected to ebay. WTH",
            "I have the full version of this app, so it doesn't contains ads. Additionally, I'm running the app on a Samsung Galaxy S9+, with no problems! It has already helped me to find my device several times, (as I have misplaced it several times, or simply forgotten where I placed it)! However, you should know that the location, lock, and wipe your phone doe come as a built in features of the basic Google suite that comes with your Android phone! I got this app for it's Additional features!",
            "This app is garbage. In about the last 6 years and 3 phones, the scream feature worked only once. The website always says its not going through bc of lack service or permission or it's off but it always goes off like 30 min after I find it myself in an area where it has full service and battery. Would give 0 stars if I could. Giving breach updates isn't \"security\", working features are. Uninstalled.",
            "I haven't had any negative experiences with this app. I like that it scans apps as you install them and let's you know whether those apps are safe. I also like that it does background scans of all my apps periodically. Overall great app for security."

The subscription renewed last May for the year, but constantly tries to get me to upgrade and pay again from with the app. It's stupid that I can't download a \"pro\" version from the app store, and forced to pay again from within the app. Very deceptive.",
            "Cant get the app to work Edit: Cant get the app to work. When I click \"Analyze\" it takes me back to \"Home Screen\". I click de app again, I get a message that says \"App keeps closing\". Below that there are two options. 1. App info. 2. Close app. And that`s it. I have this app in another Android tablet and works fine. But it won't work on this new Galaxy tab S5e Android tablet.",

No link, no instructions and after trying to activate every potential icon I still don't get any further forward. Another example of a program relying on people already knowing how to work it. But for me, just a waste of memory space. I get faster and better results from just rebooting.",
            "I use to use CCleaner years ago when I was in the computer repair field. When I found out CCleaner was available on Android naturally I was intrigued. After using it for well over a month I found CCleaner to be utterly useless. #1. It doesn't do anything my phone doesn't already do. #2. The many different notifications are extremely annoying and unnecessary. #3. My last straw was the 4 week report that is supposed to show you your least used apps. Low and behold it was drastically off."

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: G is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say G and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice G with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say G correctly in the word \"gorilla\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices G by saying \"go\" while playing cars, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say G\r\n~Guide on how to teach G to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online G flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach G to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying G\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on G for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying G!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemic🤍 God Bless🤍"

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

            "Bunch of ads and a terrible energy system, which basically let's you start a one puzzle per day, unless you pay or watch even more ads (if there weren't enough already). One puzzle takes around 10 minutes to complete, so there you have it - play for 19 minutes, wait 24 hrs, play for 10 minutes again, wait another 24 hrs etc. Honestly you can find much better games out there and I hope you do. I'm not saying this particular game is bad, but its monetization is just terrible. ... Please fix.",
            "In my initial review, I talked about the long ads between each group. Since then there is a way to shorten the ad after only 3-5 seconds. So my update is to say that this is a really fun take on a crossword puzzle and the fact that the developers listened and worked out a solution gives the game a solid 5 stars. Thank you for responding and for working to find a solution!",
            "I have a Samsung Note9 but this game uses too much battery and makes my phone hot. I love, love, love this game so these facts make me sad. UPDATE: some of the ads (which I do not mind watching since they let me play for free, I can't afford to pay) but some of the ads are freezing the game. Please fix these issues. I do not want to delete. Have a blessed day",
            "I like this game, but there are too many ads. Each game takes 2 tokens and there aren't enough ways to gain tokens. It would be best to find ways to motivate people to play the game. Do fun games where they can win more tokens. Way too many ads!! Before you can play. After you play. Its crazy and a waste of time. Otherwise I really like this game and would probably keep playing of the ad situation can be made better.",
            "I love this game.Awsome,wonderful,amazing,superb😊😊😘😘😚.This might be the best game among all crossword games.There are even powerups to help if we are unable to find the word for a question.Very nice wonderful game.But the only thing is ,it works so slow if my data pack is over.I wish it to be work fast though my data pack is over .Hence i gave 4 stars. Apart from this ,it a awesome game .Loved it.🤗🤗"

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: Z is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say Z and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice Z with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say Z correctly in the word \"zigzag\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices Z by saying \"zip\" every time a child zips a coat, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say Z\r\n~Guide on how to teach Z to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online Z flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app. You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach Z to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying Z\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on Z for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying Z\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

            "Similar feedback to most of the other users. Since the update the ads are much more frequent and really interfere with the enjoyment of playing the game. I have actively sourced another suduko game that has virtually no ads whatsoever. Thanks for your reply, However, my account WAS AD FREE, until I was advised I needed to update. I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",
            "Great game but a big memory hog and it has to stay on device, there is no option to move it to SD Card. Also, more time spent watching Ads than playing time. I play from the UK and the Non-representational Ads shown are banned by UK Trading Standards. It's on its way off my device ... UNINSTALLED.",
            "I am so furious! I subscribed for premium for a year and it worked for 3 days. I'm back to getting all the bloody annoying ads every few minutes. I hate it!! And the worst thing is there is no way to report it or contact them.",
            "Used to be great, but now the aggressive ads have killed it. I finish a puzzle in two minutes just to get hit with 2 back-to-back ads. I don't mind some advertising, but it's overkill now.",
            "The app was fine until they got all political. All the commercials have been for one party, like the are trying to jump on the main stream media ban wagon and shove the democratic party down everyone's throat. No thank you and I'm deleting the app. You can keep your one sided opinion."

            "This game has a lot of potential but after a while it gets quite boring. Don't you think that when you have the buttons with the stripes an the arrows that if you merge them together you could clear the board or some type of explosion that adds points to your score. Come on people use your imagination we all have one. If I come up with something as simple as the explosions with the straight buttons I'm sure you could come up with something a lot better since you're supposed to be the experts",
            "I've always enjoyed this type of connect games and, to me, this is probably the best one out there. You can spin a wheel once a day for free to win bombs, scissors, ect. to help if needed. Youcan use gems to buy spins and it's very easy to get gems. There's no limit to how many times you can spin the wheel as long as you have gems which is great!Some levels are difficult but you can always get extra time if you watch a 5 to 30 second ad. Try it. It's a great game!",
            "My \"go to\" game for winding down and chilling out. Rarely do I find myself frustrated, and the ads are tolerable and, quite often, convenient! My teenager laughs at my longevity/commitment.....Level 1141 and climbing! There's just so many spots waiting to be connected!!! ...................... Side note: I usually keep my volume off while I play, but sometimes I thoroughly enjoy listening to the spots ☆ \"PoP\"!☆ when connected........and the fireworks! 🤣🤭🤓",
            "I don't like that you run out of gems so fast and that you only get 2 free ones when u watch an ad its just to much work to keep pressing the button and watching ads over and over again just for two gems.. I think we should get more gems and more time on the clock.",
            "Please help! When playing a game, after a few minutes, everything freezes and can't make anymore moves.... do i perhaps need to do an update or something? Love the game and don't want to start from the beginning again. All help will be appreciated Thank you."

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

            "It's great for toddlers! But hey, parents, please PLEASE monitor you kid while playing this game. Ads pop up and they easily could tap on them. They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",
            "Get rid of ads, please. Ads arent appropriate for toddlers. This is a great game, and my toddler can't play it without getting inappropriate ads or being prompted to download things. Such a shame, as she loves it.",
            "The ad scrolling at the bottom on the screen is horrible. Every 10 seconds my 3 year old was accidently tapping it which sent it right into a full ad. She spent most of the time crying because it kept happening.",
            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "As a former I.T. consultant, this app is very easy to use, very simple, has solid functionality. I've had it for about a year. And I highly recommend it to everyone fo dictation, record music , your class lecture ; and there's no time limit either . The upgrade function as even more capability. The app has very minor and very occasional ads that are not disruptive at all in my opinion . And it's basically flawless.",
            "I've been using a portable microphone to attempt field recording for video game sound design and the app does what I need for the level I'm at. With multiple encodings for the audio, and control over sampling rate, you have a pretty decent tool. Also comes with noise suppression and echo cancellation which is more than you'd expect a free app to offer. I was going to complain about the lack of cloud synchronization...but apparently that's in the paid version 😼. I'd say it's worth it.",
            "This is an amazingly clear, and on point \"Free For All Platform App\", that works great on my 2019 reliable Honor 10 Lite!!! Please note for a great user experience: A word of advice though is to have an android agreement with Google Drive/Microsoft Cloud, as a safer way for data transition to other devices and/or flash drives. Also worth having antivirus/anti-adware/spyware software installed accordingly... Enjoy - Namaste 🙏❣️🙏🕊️😇",
            "Awesome app, very useful. The only 2 improvements I can see is adding a feature to allow a shortcut to access the recording, such as double tapping on the power button or the volume button. The second one would be having the ability to do audio compression to reduce the size of the file.",
            "Excellent!! This app has recorded many sermons at church for my disabled husband to hear, phone calls on speaker phone, songs I've sung, college projects and speeches, and much more, all with amazing clarity and ease of use! I HIGHLY recommend. I've had and have used this app for well over a year."

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: P is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say P and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice P with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say P correctly in the word \"pony\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices P by saying \"pants\" while getting dressed, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say P\r\n~Tips on how to teach P to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online P flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying P\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on P for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying P!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",

The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

My only problem with the app is the fact you can't delete contacts which is quite annoying, I know you can just block and clear them but it isn't that efficient. Please try and fix this as soon as possible. Else this is the best chat app I have ever used. Oh and I recognised a new fault in it, When using the app or web app. It takes time to load on older computers and pcs which takes hours to load due the security.",
            "It's nice that the security is good but if a IM app takes ages to send message even on high speed internet that's saddening, the webclients or even the desktop app takes ages to deliver the message in the group, that need to be fixed. In mobile app to the caching of app state is buggy, and hide content on app switch dosent work, all it does is just shows the older app state. there are many more bugs but for the time being it that's the most I want to write. And add a feature to unfriend.",
            "Consistently tells me I don't have internet even though I do. Sends messages out of order, sometimes hours or even days later, if it sends them at all. Not sure what happened, been using it for a while and it used to be fine. Super frustrating when you're trying to carry on a conversation.",
            "After a while, the sound of one of the interlocutors disappears during a voice conversation if you turn off the screen or switch to another application. But the sound returns if you switch back to Wire.",
            "For some reason one of my chat groups that does show up on my desktop does not show up on the phone app, I've attempted many times to solve this problem and still have not figured out why it's missing. Otherwise the app is fine, but I do feel it lacks some of the features that you get from keybase and that app was free. Unfortunately the PRC owns KB now so I can't trust it."

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

Got this app & within 10m it did not meet expectations. First reaction when scrolling through categories was that there was KPOP. Initial Instinct was there were INTL songs. When I searched for more INTL songs there wasn't one. This is not \"Unlimited\" as the title says. A Premium Account is needed to unlock some songs & there are none Chinese songs that I found.",

The only thing is for a person who's not on here a lot and singing for fun $19.99 is a lot to be asking for to have access to popular songs..😩🤔. But truly I'm excited about this app! Needs a $5.99 or even $9.99 what I pay for iMusic but have unlimited access to. Something to think about.",

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

            "This app is absolute garbage. Basically abandonware as only \"minor bugs\" are ever fixed. Use the website,which is not much better. Just a poor product offering overall. Nothing done to address: lack of SMS tracking; lack of fingerprint login; cannot delete alerts in-app (which are NOT synced with website); saving is slow; no 2-way sync between website and app; generally unintuitive. Complete waste of money and time. Find another option. (Nothing ever came from the offer to discuss issues.)",
            "So far I'm not impressed. Seems very easy for them to just turn off permissions for the app. The location tracking doesn't seem to work. I hit the locate now button and it said it was unable to find his device. I have no faith that this product is doing what I'd expect it to do.",

It keeps saying network issue but its not my network its the app. And i think its still running on non daylight savings so my son could not log into his ipad till an hour later.

You will learn how to systematically practice TH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say TH correctly in the word \"thimble\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices TH by saying \"the\" during a structured reading task, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say TH\r\n~Tips on how to teach TH to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online voiced and voiceless TH flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning and reading at first. Then, you just have to carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying TH\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on TH for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying TH!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

            "I chose this app because it indicated that the price for my journey wold be between 87 - 110 euros. On arrival at my destination I was presented with a bill for 159 euros. I don't think I would be inclined to recommend this app",

            "The app works most of the time but does get hung on occasion. The worst part is that even though it recovers, every time it happens it replays extra commercials instead of continuing the audio stream. I did read response from the author, and brief connection interruptions may be occurring. The interruptions occur most frequently during a popular segment so might be backend. My main point still stands, a less than 2 sec interruption should not have the app replay extra ad, just recover stream.",
            "This app doesn't work at all. It keeps on giving me a message saying try again later. This was my very first time installing this app. I tried to purchased the \"All Access\" version, but I kept on getting a message that said try again later. So this is the reason I gave it one star. I wished I couldn't get it no stars. Fix asap!",
            "I use the app a lot and have enjoyed it for many years. One of the stations I enjoy listening to is The Tchaikovsky Large Symphony Orchestra. It used to be amazing and play a great variety of classical composers. Lately, it has started playing a lot of other genres, like classic rock, Lynard Skynard, rap, Snoop Dog and Dr Dre, and country, Johnny Cash, just to name a few. I believe someone adjusted the algorithm, it would be great of it could be fixed.",
            "The version on device is up to date. The device is less than a year old. It crashes often - like just stops in middle of broadcast. Often cuts top of the hour news short - usually during the weather it just jumps to a commercial. Constantly asks user to upgrade to premium. Since this review originally posted, it has crashed about a half dozen times. All these problems are relatively new. Needs quite a bit of improvement.",
            "app is good but avoiding the subscription pop up is annoying and video ads playing 30 secs every time you switch stations is a bit much. Ads already play on the stations so it's overwhelming and is much less enjoyable than listening to a podcast show on other apps. I only use free versions of news and talk apps. I'll use more if app becomes better."

            "Starting out giving the game five Stars. So far okay. We shall see. The graphics in the game are so so just okay not that great. It's like all the other Google app store games if you want to play you're going to have to pay. And you know what! I really don't mind paying a developer real money if the game is really good and really fair and no cheating and no game fixing. Unfortunately ! Most games on Google are letting alot of players cheat ! I hate losing to a p o s cheater .",
            "Good graphics, decent gameplay but....it's set up too make you lose. Fake bot players programmed to make you win in the beginning and then once you're hooked after a few wins, you start losing. That concept is called pay-to-play. As you lose, unsurprisingly, cue the ads to buy more in-game coin. I'm not naive, I know it's a model used by most games but here it's so obvious it dulls the game. There are better bowling games out there that at least allows you to enjoy the gameplay.",
            "Bowling King is very fun but you might ask why did I give it a four-star because you could accidentally Mash something and buy it but what is really cool like some other game you have to buy a lot but in this game you can watch an ad get diamond cash coins this app is really cool and I encourage you to get it it's totally free unless you want to buy chips hope you like it.",
            "This game has been acting up for the past month. The configuration is way off! First, it changed the color of my lane...just like that! Unable to change it back. Then you can't maneuver the ball correctly. If you aim the ball either to the left or right, that's an automatic gutter ball. Please fix whatever's going on!! I love this game and I would hate to delete it!",
            "What an exciting and enjoyable APP that is realistic and challenging. Thank you. It's always a pleasure using this bowling APP. I have tried other bowling apps and always come back to this one. Thank you for the GREAT entertainment. Back for more fun. Thank you!"
