        "description": "This app is a must-try for parents, teachers, and tutors who teach reading to students of any age. It is also excellent for self-study to improve reading and English pronunciation.\r\n\r\nUltimate Phonics is useful in any situation where reading is taught:\r\n\r\n* Beginning Readers\r\n\r\nDid you know that many children never become good readers? Reading is the most important skill for education and success. If you have young children first learning to read, you can give them the gift that lasts a lifetime by teaching them with Ultimate Phonics. Just an hour per week can make a huge improvement in their reading ability.\r\n\r\n* Struggling Readers\r\n\r\nDo you have children or students who guess and skip when they read? Did you know that word guessing causes poor reading comprehension and terrible spelling? Relying on word guessing prevents students from becoming good readers and cripples their education.\r\n\r\nA good reader reads by rapidly and accurately sounding out new words. That is exactly what Ultimate Phonics teaches. It develops your students into more accurate, fluent readers with good reading comprehension.\r\n\r\n* Dyslexia and Orton-Gillingham\r\n\r\nUltimate Phonics is very effective for teaching dyslexics to read. The app can be used either by itself or as a supplement for Orton-Gillingham programs or other programs designed to overcome dyslexia.\r\n\r\nIf you are an Orton-Gillingham teacher, you will love this app. It has excellent word lists and decodable sentences, all broken down and sounded out. The app also has a Find feature that lets you look up lessons matching any phonogram in a matter of seconds. This app is a great supplement to any Orton-Gillingham program and is guaranteed to become a useful tool in your teaching toolkit.\r\n\r\n* Adult Literacy\r\n\r\nAdult learners love the design of the program because it teaches them to read clearly and directly, without insulting them. And tutors love Ultimate Phonics because it's easy to use and produces great results. Try it for yourself and see why Ultimate Phonics is an essential teaching tool for any adult literacy situation.\r\n\r\n* ESL and English Pronunciation\r\n\r\nESL (English as a Second Language) students need to learn to read English at the same time they are learning to speak it. Ultimate Phonics effectively improves reading, spelling, and pronunciation for ESL students of all ages.\r\n\r\nIf you are a student learning English, you can use Ultimate Phonics to help with both your reading and your pronunciation. The app breaks down thousands of words and sentences by their individual speech sounds, so you learn in detail how to pronounce words more accurately.\r\n\r\n*** CONTENT\r\n\r\nThe complete program consists of more than 4,400 words and 2,100 sentences organized into 262 lessons. The lessons are grouped into 12 levels, teaching the entire phonics system of English.\r\n\r\nYou get the first level (lessons 1 to 50) for free. You have the option of purchasing additional levels one at a time or purchasing all the levels at once at a discount.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the topics in each level:\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 1 (Lessons 1 to 50)\r\nSimple words with short vowels, single consonants, and consonant blends.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 2 (Lessons 51 to 80)\r\nConsonant digraphs (sh, ch, th, wh, ck), qu, x, ng and nk patterns, and doubled consonants.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 3 (Lessons 81 to 106)\r\nVowel digraphs (ee, ea, oo, ai, ay, oa, ou, ow, aw, au, oy, oi).\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 4 (Lessons 107 to 124)\r\nEndings (s, es, ed, ing, ful), apostrophes and more.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 5 (Lessons 125 to 147)\r\nSyllables, compound words, and multi-syllable words.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 6 (Lessons 148 to 155)\r\nSoft c and g patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 7 (Lessons 156 to 171)\r\nLong vowels in magic e syllables.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 8 (Lessons 172 to 183)\r\nLong vowels in open syllables.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 9 (Lessons 184 to 209)\r\n22 more long vowel patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 10 (Lessons 210 to 225)\r\nR-controlled vowels (ar, er, ir, or, ur, and more).\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 11 (Lessons 226 to 239)\r\n13 more short vowel patterns.\r\n\r\n* LEVEL 12 (Lessons 240 to 262)\r\nSilent letters and advanced patterns.",

            "This app contains the material needed to teach reading. It has the sound, words and sentences. However, I think the full app possibly has too many lessons, as it tries to teach nearly every possible combination of letters that make a sound. Also, it is very dry. It is like a text book. For these same reasons, I think it would work quite well with an adult or older child who wants to learn to read. The trial version is free, though, so go ahead and try it.",
            "Amazing app to learn phonics! I use the desktop app in class/via Zoom lessons (it was a life-saver during pandemic!) with my students. They download the app to practice at home (first 50 lessons on phone/tablet-based app are free). It's hard to practice phonics solo if you can't check for correct pronunciation. This way, students immediately discover if they read a word correctly. Eliminates frustration, reinforces their efforts and builds in success! They love it. Great tech support too!",

My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",

Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

So ie listen to a book and check my calender or see photos.. It can definently use an update and makeover. Would be wonderful if downloaded photos for a book was shown on the app /book, if it worked with adding books to my reading lists. There are always errors for these functions.",
            "It's a good base but can be better. I'd like some of the redundancy of the buttons to be solved, the voice to have more settings, perhaps to make it talk faster or slower, basic features like the ability to delete folders, and most importantly, enabling this app to run while using other apps. I'd like to be able to still use my phone while listening to my college texts. And is there plans to provide this on iPad to replace Read2Go? Good app, I just think it needs some work.",

        "description": "Do you know that 80% of learning problems are reading problems? Difficulties, such as dyslexia or hyperlexia, in reading can explain 60% of school failure.\r\n\r\nReadUp by Glifing is the game that improves children's reading and reading comprehension using the Glifing method. It is a method that children with reading difficulties can benefit from, regardless of whether they suffer from dyslexia, reading disorder, ADHD, Down syndrome, specific language disorder, stuttering ..., as well as children who already read well but want to read with more fluidity and ease. In addition, it is a complementary application to those already used by schools to teach reading and to reinforce reading. There are already more than 80,000 children around the world who have managed to improve.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is aimed at children between 6 and 12 years old who are learning to read or who want to improve or perfect their level. Children with 4 or 5 years old who have a knowledge of letters can also play and learn.\r\n\r\nAvailable in Spanish and Catalan.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is divided into reading levels. At the beginning of the game, a level test is carried out on the child to know what their reading level is, this reading level is not linked to the school year, in this way they can learn and improve from their real level.\r\n\r\nWithin a reader level there are islands and each island has 30 missions to complete. In all missions you are accompanied by the Readup dragon. This friendly character is the mascot for the child and provides instructions to the adult or tutor on how to carry out each of the missions.\r\n\r\nA mission brings together all the phases that make up the Glifing method:\r\n\r\n1. Phonological path of reading. Train decoding by reading pseudowords.\r\n2. Lexical path of reading. Train the recognition of frequent words globally.\r\n3. Memory training. Strengthens memory, where the phonological imprint and visual memory are improved.\r\n4. Reading comprehension. It requires understanding in the context of previous mission activities.\r\n\r\nIn each mission you can get up to 3 stars, these are determined according to the successes that have been completed in each of the previous activities.\r\n\r\nFinally, so that the playful part of the game is understood, at the end of the mission, there is a minigame, the objective of which is to feed the dragon, and here you can also obtain gems depending on how well it is done.\r\n\r\nStars and gems can be used to customize the dragon in Readup's Dragon Shop. Therefore, the more you play, the more missions will be completed, and the more fun customizations you can make to the dragon.\r\n\r\nWe believe that parents or guardians are an essential part in the education of children, for this reason, in each mission it is required that the lexical and morphological path activities be carried out jointly with them, that is, it will be the parent or guardian who determines if the child has pronounced the word correctly. When it is not possible to be together, the tutor mode can be disabled and those missions are marked with an exclamation to remember that that part is missing to complete it. We know that there are automatic methods of voice recognition, but we are committed to strengthening the relationship between parents (or guardians) with children.\r\n\r\nGlifing is based on its own method registered under a research project carried out at the UB (University of Barcelona).

        "title": "Language and Cognitive Therapy for Children (MITA)",
        "description": "‚Ä¢ THE FIRST AND ONLY LANGUAGE THERAPY APPLICATION SUPPORTED BY CLINICAL DATA: \r\nIn a 3-year clinical trial of 8,766 children with autism, young children who trained with MITA improved their language score at the end of the trial on average 3-times more than similar children who did not use MITA. See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02708290. \r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises designed to last for 10 years\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Used by over 1,000,000 children with language delay\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Best Autism App on the Healthline‚Äôs list\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Farsi, and Chinese.\r\n\r\nMental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with language delay and autism. MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.\r\n‚Ä¢ Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.\r\n‚Ä¢ Based on Pivotal Response Treatment that targets development of response to multiple cues. \r\n‚Ä¢ Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time\r\n‚Ä¢ Identify colors, patterns and sizes\r\n‚Ä¢ Integrate objects into a unified picture\r\n‚Ä¢ Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front\r\n‚Ä¢ Time prepositions: Before/After\r\n‚Ä¢ Passive verb tense\r\n‚Ä¢ Subject / Object\r\n‚Ä¢ Reading and Writing\r\n‚Ä¢ Numbers and counting\r\n‚Ä¢ Arithmetic\r\n‚Ä¢ Logic and reasoning\r\n‚Ä¢ Mental perspective taking\r\n‚Ä¢ Mental mathematics\r\n‚Ä¢ Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun\r\n‚Ä¢ No Wi-Fi necessary\r\n‚Ä¢ No ads\r\n\r\nMITA develops your child‚Äôs imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child's ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \r\nThe verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\r\nMITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. MITA exercises can be used by children with language delay, ASD, PDD, intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), Down syndrome, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as a supplement to conventional speech therapy.\r\n\r\nMITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J.

See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02708290. <br><br>‚Ä¢ Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises designed to last for 10 years<br><br>‚Ä¢ Used by over 1,000,000 children with language delay<br><br>‚Ä¢ Best Autism App on the Healthline‚Äôs list<br><br>‚Ä¢ Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Farsi, and Chinese.<br><br>Mental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with language delay and autism. MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.<br><br><br>MITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES<br><br>‚Ä¢ Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.<br>‚Ä¢ Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.<br>‚Ä¢ Based on Pivotal Response Treatment that targets development of response to multiple cues. <br>‚Ä¢ Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time<br>‚Ä¢ Identify colors, patterns and sizes<br>‚Ä¢ Integrate objects into a unified picture<br>‚Ä¢ Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front<br>‚Ä¢ Time prepositions: Before/After<br>‚Ä¢ Passive verb tense<br>‚Ä¢ Subject / Object<br>‚Ä¢ Reading and Writing<br>‚Ä¢ Numbers and counting<br>‚Ä¢ Arithmetic<br>‚Ä¢ Logic and reasoning<br>‚Ä¢ Mental perspective taking<br>‚Ä¢ Mental mathematics<br>‚Ä¢ Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun<br>‚Ä¢ No Wi-Fi necessary<br>‚Ä¢ No ads<br><br>MITA develops your child‚Äôs imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child&#39;s ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. <br>The verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.<br>MITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. MITA exercises can be used by children with language delay, ASD, PDD, intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), Down syndrome, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as a supplement to conventional speech therapy.<br><br>MITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J.

To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered. I have to change a level back manually at each session, because I am sure that my child does not remember a name of an object, but got the program algoryth using visual clues.",

Table of Contents with auto creation even for plain text files;\r\n‚úî Convenient and informative bookmarks;\r\n‚úî Ability to select, copy and share any text from the document. Intelligent sharing of quotes ‚Äì customize the text to share, attach the book title and/or author name in one tap;\r\n‚úî Locking of the screen orientation in the reader;\r\n‚úî Customizable text size ‚Äì use the pinch-to-zoom multi-touch gesture;\r\n‚úî Light/day and dark/night themes;\r\n‚úî Automatic book encoding detection;\r\n‚úî Quick lists of recent files, web documents and bookmarks;\r\n‚úî Clean, simple and intuitive interface.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEED READING\r\n\r\nIncrease your reading speed in 1.5-2 times straight away! If you wish you could read 3 or even 4 times faster than usual without the slightest loss of meaning.\r\n\r\nReedy uses a technique called RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) allowing you to read with any comfortable speed. Words are shown fast one after another on the same place of the screen which increases the speed of perception of every single word. With RSVP you can read being entirely absorbed into a book.\r\n\r\nLook straight at the displayed word and try to perceive it without subvocal articulation. Also, don‚Äôt forget to blink. This recommendation can be applied not only to reading :) You should never let your eyes‚Äô surface get dry.\r\n\r\nIncrease the speed when you get used to and think you‚Äôre ready.\r\n\r\n‚úî Touch the screen to play or pause;\r\n‚úî The speed of reading is up to 3000 words per minute with a possible gradual acceleration;\r\n‚úî Progress bar and time left till the end of a book;\r\n‚úî Quick preview of the full text (including text formatting, images, tables, etc.) during a pause in the speed reader;\r\n‚úî Smart slowing ‚Äì reducing the speed at punctuation marks and complicated words;\r\n‚úî Focus mode ‚Äì the focus point is shifted closer to the beginning of a word;\r\n‚úî Navigation through the sentences and paragraphs;\r\n‚úî Switch easily between the regular reading and the speed reading;\r\n‚úî Use volume buttons to control the speed reader:\r\n‚Äî Press any volume button once to stop or proceed the reading. Press and hold to navigate through sentences;\r\n‚Äî Or just use volume buttons for quick speed adjusting.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BEGIN THE READING\r\n\r\n‚úî Open a file from your device or sd-card using built-in file manager.\r\nFormats: FB2, EPUB (no DRM) / KEPUB, TXT, HTML + reading books in ZIP-archives.\r\n‚úî Send a web page from your favorite web browser, Pocket, Feedly, Evernote;\r\n‚úî Use Reedy for opening books from another apps and clouds (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.);\r\n‚úî Copy any text or link and paste it into the reader.\r\nAlso you can simply share it with Reedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACTS\r\n\r\nExtension for Chrome:\r\nhttp://snip.li/p-reedy-chrome\r\n\r\nJoin us:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/ReedyReader\r\nhttps://facebook.com/reedy.reader\r\n\r\nWeb-site:\r\nhttps://reedy-reader.com\r\n\r\nE-Mail:\r\nazadev.team@gmail.com\r\n\r\n‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ\r\n\r\nLanguages: English, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian\r\nHelp with translations: https://goo.gl/4uRwYD\r\n\r\nIf you‚Äôve met any difficulties in some file or web document, please let us know by e-mailing at azagroup.team@gmail.com, and don‚Äôt forget to attach the problem document.",

            "I love this app. Pros: - It has never served me ads. - They help me chomp through books I want to read. - It has text to speech AND speed reading. - I haven't noticed them sending out any information I'd rather keep private. It really feels like the developer is just plain passionate about the project. That being said it does have it's downsides: -The app occasionally forgets my place in a text. (fixed by using bookmarks.) -It kept losing track of my books I downloaded from the Humble Bundle App. Meaning I had to go back and open the file anew. In spite of those bugs it feels like this is a truly free e-reader with multiple modes of conveying info into my skull. Which is exactly what I wanted at the time.",
            "Originally it was 5 stars but your last update really messed up a few things such as I'm no longer able to open links inside of an established document. That used to really help me out. Now it just shows me the same thing I was already reading or it bugs out and when I exit out and come back it shows me that I did open up the webpage. I also don't like are you guys have now organized the favorites, though this is just a personal preference. I hope you guys fix the first thing I mentioned.",
            "I used to love this app. But now the voice to text part keeps malfunctioning. It freezes up, goes silent and jumps ahead and reads at a crazy fast speed. It's useless now. I will be uninstalling it now. Time to look for another app to use.",
            "had to use a different app instead because the text to speech feature keeps malfunctioning even though i have tried to reinstall again and again and it works just on other apps so i think it isnt a problem with my phone but the itself.",
            "Draining battery insanely fast even during standard reading."

            "In the beginning I thought it's silly to try an online app for psychic reading - I'm a face-to-face kind of person, don't believe in all this online mumbo jumbo - but since the coronavirus outbreak I kind of got used to using apps for everything so I also tried getting psychic advice online. I kind of got addicted! It's really nice to be able to choose a psychic from a huge selection of proven readers.",
            "It was so easy to start a session, get my advice and pay - It's a lot quicker than actually finding a good psychic around me (lord knows I tried), so I'm sure I'm going to keep going with this app for a long time. Also I really liked the reviews on each psychic so you can tell which ones are really top notch and only choose them, thought they say that they screen all psychics so i guess they should all be trustworthy.",
            "What an awesome app! Huge choice of psychics to choose from, depending on what specialty you need you can talk to palm readers, tarot card readers or mediums, all in one app and great prices compared to other apps! also the app is so convenient because I can choose between a chat or a phone call to a psychic, so depending on my mood i can use different options, its really the best psychic app out there!",
            "It's not always easy to listen to the voices that are always around us - but talking to someone who does it all the time helps me become more aware",
            "The part it says \"free psychic readings\" is false. It should really say \"free 3 min for first time customers\". Don't waste your time if that's what you're looking for."

            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",

Worse yet, Google Play denied a refund of the $3.49 purchase price, despite my  requesting the refund within less than an hour of purchase. I uninstalled the app, re-downloaded, and now all I have access to is the free version; I can't even use the limited functionality I paid for in the first place!

        "description": "Caring for a child with special needs can demand a lot of energy and time. There may be days when you feel overwhelmed, stressed, or intimidated. Parenting isn‚Äôt ever easy, and raising a child with learning disability is even more challenging.

But there‚Äôs a solution: he can take his raft to the letter islands and recover the word treasure. This treasure will make him incredibly rich, mainly in knowledge and experience, so that he can rescue his crew from the grip of the sinister sea monster Analphabetus and buy himself a ship.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hippocampus' Spelling C is a game adapted to kids learning to read and speak but learners of all ages can enjoy it and have fun while learning intuitively and independently.\r\n\r\nIt's time for English! Learn how to pronounce and to write English words as well as words from other languages (see list below). You can learn how to read and how to speak. This is the free version.\r\nCan learning to read be as easy and exciting as playing a computer game? We've developed a game with which you can learn to read intuitively and individually, as you would play a game.\r\nWe believe that a learning game has to be so good that it would encourage you to play it even though you might not be interested in its pedagogical content. We've done our best to implement this idea in our game. In doing so, we incorporate psycho-pedagogical foundations and concepts from the Montessori method, improve upon such tools as phonetic charts and present the syllables as they are actually spoken and not as they would be if spoken separately. Our emphasis is not on learning to recite the alphabet or spelling out words; on the contrary, instead of learning the ABC off by heart, the pupil learns which sounds actually occur in each word. As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.\r\n\r\nShould you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org \r\n\r\nThe game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. Similarly to the  Pimsleur method, you hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.\r\n\r\nContains: English, German, French, Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian, Italian, Turkish, Polish, Danish, Swedish, Bulgarian, Catalan, Georgian, Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, Greek",

I thank playstore, along with everybody involve in this project. I understand algebra and readying better. Thanks again, Make more app educational wise, plz, You got my support.",
            "My son doesn't like that there are too many songs in this app that take too long. He says he would rather they explained the material without singing. He says he would give it half a star if he could.",
            "Have used this on Windows 10 laptops, a Mac Computer, iPhone, iPad, Kindle Fire 7 tablet - works well on the iOS devices, but not well on the Kindle Fire 7 - I wish it did, as I love the Fire - but often the video gets out of sync with the sound.  My students love it - and I have 5 on it right now on Windows 10 laptops - no syncing problems at all.  When one logs out, there seems to be a 3 or 4 or 5 minute delay before that student can log in again, to the same account.  A bit of a problem when the Kindle would log me out for some unknown reason a bunch of times.  We did get through all the lessons on the Fire and only found one that didn't work -  and we get to try this for free for another year.  A great step in the right direction for apps for adult literacy.  Wish that it worked on the inexpensive FIre 7.  I will purchase a Fire 8 and see if the increased memory solves the syncing and logging out issues.",

Now including seahorses and turtles!\r\n\r\nWhether it be a newborn baby, infant, or child. This sensory play activity is guaranteed to provide them with joy and entertainment! Ideal for when you‚Äôre out and about and your infant is getting bored or upset, when your toddler won‚Äôt settle and getting up to mischief or when you just want to relax your kids before bed time ‚Äì distract and get their attention with some visual stimulation in a joyful way!\r\n\r\nThis sensorial app has many unique features in comparison with other sensory based games, such as the firework, bubble, balloon pop and finger paint games available. Choose to amuse your baby with this visually stimulating, interactive, sensory game.\r\n\r\nNot only will this sensory app delight your kids, it will also provide increased educational benefits. From the early stages of your babies development, they are constantly learning and absorbing information around them, they begin to see, touch, feel, hear and understand how their interactions are affecting the environment around them. Your baby will begin to learn that touching the screen will cause bubbles to be created. Your child can drag your finger across the screen to create a pattern of bubbles. Your newborn can place their hands on the screen to cause lots of bubbles to be created at all points on the screen that they are touching. \r\n\r\nWith sensory fish, your child will experience and educate themselves by use of the cause and effect techniques and features implemented. As your baby touches the screen, they gain instant feedback of a vibration, sound effects and bubbles. They will eventually begin to understand that their touch is also causing the fish to swim towards where they touched. If they were to touch the screen in multiple position, the fish will swim between all of those touched positions! Your baby learns and adapts to their findings within the game. \r\n\r\nAs the game is fairly simple to understand and not too complex, it is ideal for young kids, boys and girls of ages from 0 months (with a parent showing them the game), up to the late kindergarten / preschool stage of their development where they fully understand and can control all aspects of the world and have learned exactly what the cause will be from their actions.\r\n\r\nSensory game play is great for the continued development of your kids motor skills and hand eye coordination development. It aids in helping to fine tune the motoric skills and movements, the very detailed movements that we require and use every day.\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown to have great benefits in learning and stimulation for children with autism and children with special educational needs (SEN). Having already received excellent feedback from parents who have children with autism, special educational needs (SEN) and learning disabilities. \r\n\r\nInstall now! It‚Äôs convenient, educational, stimulating, fun and best of all, it‚Äôs free!",

I also can't stand when I'm listening to an audiotext and the voice changes midway through, so ic really prefer to stay with the current narrator. P.S. if you want better ratings try uploading books like the Stalking Jack the Ripper series for older dyslexia readers.",
            "The service is vital but the app itself is terrible. It's definitely something that if I didn't *need* it so bad I wouldn't use it *because* of the app. The app is glitchy and rereads the same pages over and over, shut off at random times, the pages must be manually turned much of the time or it gets sick/goes back to the page you started on at random intervals (too bad if you didn't know your pg #), it shuts off w/ the screen, and there's no option to control the playback from the lock screen.",
            "Whenever I'm listening to a story and my phone screen times out, it will either reread a section that was pages away or it will just abruptly stop.",
            "Audio playback is buggy. Audio skips back randomly making it frustrating to listen to.",
            "This is a great app and I really recommend it. It has EVERYTHING you need to have a good time reading"

We've developed a game with which you can learn to read intuitively and individually, as you would play a game.\r\nWe believe that a learning game has to be so good that it would encourage you to play it even though you might not be interested in its pedagogical content. We've done our best to implement this idea in our game. In doing so, we incorporate psycho-pedagogical foundations and concepts from the Montessori method, improve upon such tools as phonetic charts and present the syllables as they are actually spoken and not as they would be if spoken separately. Our emphasis is not on learning to recite the alphabet or spelling out words; on the contrary, instead of learning the ABC off by heart, the pupil learns which sounds actually occur in each word. As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.\r\n\r\nShould you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org \r\n\r\nThe game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. You hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.",

        "description": "Supersense is the smartest assistive app that helps blind and visually impaired users to read, find objects, and explore places independently. It provides a set of digital eyes to make the physical world more accessible for the blind and low vision community. \r\n\r\nSupersense uses the power of AI to not only describe things but actually solve problems for blind and visually impaired users. Users can independently:\r\n- Read texts, documents and handwriting quickly using our unique auto camera guidance system\r\n- Locate specific objects such as a chair, door, trashcan, or person around by scanning the environment with the camera\r\n- Explore new and unfamiliar environments and hear about the objects that are around\r\n- Read texts on photos and PDFs from other apps. Simply share the files to Supersense and it will read it for you in seconds.\r\n\r\nEvery single feature works without an internet connection so that they can be used in any situation.\r\n\r\nThe app has full TalkBack accessibility support and is available in multiple languages.\r\n\r\nSupersense is developed by Mediate, an MIT-spinoff AI start-up based in Boston. Mediate develops innovative computer vision systems with the support of the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Veterans Affairs. This app is just the first step in our mission to develop groundbreaking AI solutions for people with visual disabilities. We have developed the app with principles of human-centered design and with the assistance of blind and visually impaired users. We also partnered with many organizations that help the blind and low vision community.\r\n\r\nIf you would like any assistance or help, please email us at feedback@mediate.tech.

            "\"Free Trial\" offered ZERO reads, in other words the Trial was actually just a view of the App, like a photo that someone posted. ¬£100 is a lot of money to throw out \"hoping\" the app will work. In summary there are 2 problems so far, the free trial is not a trial, and it is expensive.",
            "Didn't work at all. I heard it was on the braille note touch plus that I'm researching. After Installing it said \"thank you for evaluating\" and asked if I wanted to unlock unlimited. It wouldn't even let me try it to see if it was right for my blind 12yo. None of the buttons did anything and no help available. So much for that program."

For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update. I was in ths middle of listening to a book when the update happened"

If you using pdf better use moon reader, they have simplified mode and night mode also they bookmark your pdf or book folder (no sign up) and of course they can use text to speech as well. 3. They don't have search feature or favourite for the voice so good luck searching it. The pros probably 1. They can use cloud, 2. They can use ocr (paid). 3. Lots of voice (paid)",
            "Love the app. It's really good for slow readers like me. Can you guys please add folders for adding custom books you own so you can read them? I also love the CC feature as well. I have bad reading comprehension and a intellectual learning disability so I have a hard time learning. It's really hard trying to find a app like this. It's a good app if anyone has a learning disability who struggles. If I take a picture of a Japanese light novel book in English that I bought will ORC pick it up?",

Im not where i can afford that atm and Im a sad that I didnt realise it before i uninstalled. I prefer one time pymnts. The new version says there is a free version but it wont work on my phone.",

I have to back all the way out and restart the app in order for it to play the sounds again. It has been the same problem ever since we started using it 3 weeks ago. Very frustrating. Please fix bug.

This app has improved her attention span and speech development. This 'listening game' has helped with sounding out words (learning to read) for all 3 kids! On the side it's a great 'mood breaker' -¬†it's calming as the kids know they need to be quiet to listen. Thank you for developing this app! I like the accent options! Looking forward to your other apps as we progress!",
            "A great application that my daughter loved.  A match the sound/picture to the card game format that gradually reduces the obviousness of the prompts to improve sound/letter recognition.   As a future feature it would be good if there was a learning mode that took the kids through each new sound and incrementally through each game mode (limited number to all sounds) in a guided way as often I just went and put it on the \"all\" mode rather than have to keep changing the setting for my child.",

The app makes it easy to teach students who are learning to read and spell to automatically recognise and understand the 200 most common words in English.\r\n\r\n\r\nSight Words 1 Pro uses a unique, patent pending, self-adjusting and multisensory teaching method to improve word recognition and vocabulary knowledge. It was developed by Dr. Bartek Rajkowski, PhD, a speech-language pathologist specialising in reading development.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\n- Although students love using it, Sight Words 1 Pro is not just a game - it is a powerful and fully customisable teaching tool. Please take some time to experiment with it yourself before trying it with students!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe past several decades of research have provided conclusive evidence that competent readers are skilled in using letter-sound knowledge to work out (decode) unfamiliar words when reading. Teaching methods that begin by teaching students letter-sound relationships (synthetic phonics methods) are known to be superior to other approaches in teaching reading, regardless of whether students do or do not have reading difficulties. Decoding skills are crucial for self-teaching, as they may be used to work out regular words (words with regular sound-spelling patterns, such as ‚Äòstop‚Äô and ‚Äòflight‚Äô) however they are not as useful for learning the approximately 20% of English words with irregular spellings (words such as ‚Äòwho‚Äô and ‚Äòsaid‚Äô).\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch suggests that in addition to being taught to decode, students should be explicitly taught to recognise the most common words (also called 'sight words' or 'high frequency words'), especially those with irregular spellings. Learning to instantly recognise highly frequent words helps students to develop fluency in reading. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhether you are a teacher, parent or reading specialist, we are confident that Sight Words 1 Pro will quickly become a favourite teaching tool. For more information about the program, please see www.readingdoctor.com.au.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the things you can do with SightWords 1 Pro:\r\n\r\n- Teach sight words through arcade-style games in which you choose words for the student to practice based on categories such as\r\n\r\n        - Word length (such as all word lengths, 1-2 letter words, 3 letter words, 4 letter words)\r\n        - Word frequency (such as 1st 25 most common words, 2nd 25 most common words etc)\r\n\r\n- Easily create custom sight-words activities where you can quickly set up activities by choosing from a library of the 200 most common words in English\r\n\r\n- Save custom activities for later use\r\n\r\n- Choose the number of words to be included in a single game (2-25)\r\n\r\n- Adjust the number of times students need to correctly identify a word in order for the game tile to be completed\r\n\r\n- Adjust the level of support given to the student for words (the app includes auditory word prompts, auditory sentences, illustrations of the meanings of words and visual cues based on word length and shape)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: teaching students sight words before they have learnt basic decoding skills is NOT recommended, and not supported by research! Teaching sight words should be a complementary strategy to assist the development of fluency as part of a systematic, phonics based method of reading instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need help, please don't hesitate to contact us!",

        "description": "WHAT IS SPELLING SOUNDS‚Ñ¢ 1 PRO? \r\n\r\nSpelling Sounds‚Ñ¢ 1 Pro helps beginning and struggling readers to learn to spell. It is a fun, effective and scientifically based teaching tool that helps you to teach students to segment (break up) words into speech sounds and to then spell them using letter-sound knowledge. The app uses a unique teaching system that automatically identifies what a child knows, what the child does not know, and which words the student finds difficult.\r\n\r\nSpelling Sounds‚Ñ¢ 1 Pro includes a large library of CVC, CCVC and CVCC words (such as \"cat, spot\" and \"lost\") and is fully customisable, making it easy to set up custom activities to teach students to read specific word types (such as words ending in -at, or words beginning with st-). While the app is designed to be able to be used independently, it is a perfect complement to our flagship program, Reading Sounds‚Ñ¢ 1 Pro.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY IS THE ABILITY TO BREAK WORDS UP INTO SPEECH SOUNDS WHEN SPELLING IMPORTANT?\r\n\r\nSkilled spellers are good at understanding that words are made up of speech sounds (a skill called phonemic awareness). They are also good at understanding how these speech sounds are represented by letters in words. These skills help children to spell words successfully because understanding how letters usually represent the way we say words gives children an advantage in understanding our spelling system. Difficulties with these skills are a hallmark of the struggling speller.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES SPELLING SOUNDS‚Ñ¢ 1 PRO HELP?\r\n\r\nSpelling Sounds‚Ñ¢ 1 Pro uses a patent pending, self-adjusting, multisensory teaching method to help teach beginning and struggling spellers to use letter-sound knowledge to spell simple words with direct letter-sound patterns, such as \"cat, stop\" and \"lost\". The teaching system automatically identifies what a child knows, what the child does not know, and which words the child confuses. Spelling Sounds‚Ñ¢ 1 Pro includes a large library of CVC, CCVC and CVCC words. It is fully customisable, making it easy to set up custom activities to teach students to spell specific word types (such as words ending in -at, or words beginning with st-). \r\n\r\n\r\nWHO SHOULD USE SPELLING SOUNDS‚Ñ¢ 1 PRO?\r\n\r\nSpelling Sounds‚Ñ¢ 1 Pro is ideal for helping beginning spellers, students with spelling difficulties and students learning English as a second language. It is a perfect complement to any phonics program and is fully customisable. We are confident it will quickly become a favourite tool for teachers, parents, literacy specialists and anybody else with an interest in the teaching of reading and spelling! \r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF FEATURES\r\n\r\n- Created by a literacy expert\r\n- Scientifically-based\r\n- Easy to use\r\n- Fun, intuitive and powerful teaching tool\r\n- Perfect for children of all ages learning to read English, including students with learning difficulties and students of - English as a second language (ESL)\r\n- Patent-pending, adjustable memory-aid system helps students remember letter-sound patterns\r\n- Create and save custom activities to complement any synthetic phonics program",

            "I love the Kindle app! Never thought I would read e-books because I prefer to read a physical copy, but with covid and recently down sizing e-books are so much easier to read, and store! They take up no space. Best of all with the free Kindle app you can read books for free. Other books do cost but you do not have to buy anything to be able to read! Book lovers need this app!",
            "This app is well done as expected from Amazon. However, my biggest frustration is that highlighting is based on whole words and not characters. There are times where I will need to highlight one word and the current highlighting system makes it impossible without highlighting other objects around it. There are apps that allow for character based highlighting. Please change this and I will change my review to 5 stars.",
            "Bug-ridden garbage. Latest update 28/1/19 just marked all my books as new & unread when most of them should be partially or wholly read. So much for \"bug fixes\"! October 2020. There's an expression, \"If it ain't bust, don't fix it.\" Doesn't apply in this case. Definitely bust. Oh, and you'll need a magnifier to see the new Aa menu.",
            "The Kindle icon recently disappeared from my screen, so I reinstalled the app. The icon has re-appeared, but when I try to open any book from my library I get a message saying that Kindle has closed. Kindle no longer works on my device (Google Nexus). Does this have anything to do with the upgrade on 15th October ? If this isn't fixed soon I'm going to be asking for a refund for all the Kindle books in my library. Not happy.",
            "App itself is ok, latest update is hot garbage. Honestly I'm amazed they haven't hotfixed it yet, considering all the people who can't use the store at all right now. Pretty tired of getting push notifications, only to select them and get an error when it tries to display a store page. My other major annoyance at the moment - they decided to default to autoscroll instead of page flip, even when you've previously turned it off. How hard is it to just set it according to what the user specified?"

            "I LOVE THIS APP. I've had it for about 2 years now and it works perfectly. The updates are working and I don't experience any glitches and problems. All my favourite books are written on the app and getting to know the writers and the rest of the Wattpaders is really awesome and fun. I can write my chapters properly, only problem is, I'm worried it does not save or publish properly as it gives me false information and can be confusing. But nonetheless, great reading app!! Highly recommended.",
            "Helloooo. I'm writing this to say that I like the previous version of wattpad. When I open the app, it doesn't take long for the stories to appear. Now, I still need to open the internet to see my library which is a bit of a hassle. If I may recommend, please return the previous versions. The one without the need to download offline stories, because seriously, I don't like the update. I've been on wattpad since 2011 and so far, this is the worse update for me.",
            "The app itself is good but lately, i have been experiencing a lot of events such as one time I was writing a story that was worth about 600+ words but then a warning popped up saying \"wattpad has suddenly stopped\" which as you may know, all of the things i written wasn't saved. It broke my heart because I've been wanting to finish i but I have to restart and write it again. I hope that you can fix this. If so maybe the problem is my device.",
            "I'm using wattpad since 2014. Every year I saw how it changed. I'm missing the old wattpad when there is no Ads (every chapter), you can read different stories without paying for it, and you can add many stories in your library. Idk, what are the creators are thinking, lol. I just hope that the next update will get more better (lessen the ads and remove the limit of stories you can add in your library for offline reading)",
            "I totally want the Old Wattpad back. Everything is far different of what I used to love about this app. I've been using this app for almost 10 years and I know that the creator wants to improve it and earned money from it but this is too much. I have been experiencing some moments when I can't read because I need to connect to Internet but I'm already connected and that confuse me..."

            "I read tarot but don't always have the cards with me. The cards are accurate in their placement and as long as the person reading has their own context clues, the reading will be quite good. And the more I use this app, the more I appreciate all its features. Try out some of these different paths. I love the different spreads and will probably add some of then to what I do now. Even the ads are not intrusive. Very manageable. I am very grateful for this app.",
            "I love it. Fun, interesting & spot on with most of it. As it goes... \"Tarot never lies\". Its amazing how accurate these are. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose. Hope it works as well for others as it does me & people around me who try it from my phone. Mind blowing! Take what you read on the light side, not too serious. Its great.",
            "This app has so far been good. I don't have any problem using it every day üòÖ. Nevertheless, I would urge the creator to add one more special feature about moon & sun signs astrologyüò≠, besides having the horoscope section. üòéüòá It will also better the app.",
            "That was actually spot on. I'm new to tarot but catching on quick. I have had paranormal experiences my entire life. Have seen 6 UFOs. Dreams I remember having, that give me deja vu, witch always have to do with future events in my life and are almost exactly the same. Plus I'm pretty good at predicting cards with shapes. Not sure what all that means and have been searching for answers my entire life. Tarot makes a lot of sense to me and so far it's been a positive tool in my life.",
            "First use was soooo accurate. I was able to connect with two friends spiritually and that's exactly what it read. Also, it said If I start a new business soon, I can accomplish it. Weirdd because I've been debating since last year and just these past few months about starting my own..."

We've developed a game with which you can learn to read intuitively and individually, as you would play a game.\r\nWe believe that a learning game has to be so good that it would encourage you to play it even though you might not be interested in its pedagogical content. We've done our best to implement this idea in our game. In doing so, we incorporate psycho-pedagogical foundations and concepts from the Montessori method, improve upon such tools as phonetic charts and present the syllables as they are actually spoken and not as they would be if spoken separately. Our emphasis is not on learning to recite the alphabet or spelling out words; on the contrary, instead of learning the ABC off by heart, the pupil learns which sounds actually occur in each word. As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.\r\n\r\nShould you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org \r\n\r\nThe game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. You hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.",

The apps default was not in english, but is easily changed. I would rate it 5 stars if there were a easy 'purchase full app' option. 10000 credits purchase all but one word search category...English Clothing category is misspelled with a V.",
            "On tablet, I tried to remove the ads and buying the game then instead it foced me to accept some wired terms which took me to some page that foces me to buy some commercial items. I would recommenc any parents who got the same experience trying to buy this app to raise their voice. scam scam this is!!! Check Camy Rose comments. On mobile, the first time I was allowed to buy the app, then when I downloaded again on the same mobile and now I have to ho over the same issues as the tablet.",
            "I like it just a bit it gives me a hard time to look at words and i don't pay attention to the help kn it i love it so much abd that was the end of the day if im playing so hard and tough though i thought it was easy but super hard its silly it makes no sense im not surprised that it doesn't look right to me which is hard SO im not going to care much about just this for now the only thing i hate is the hints",
            "It loaded in Spanish. No other option to switch to english.",
            "to many double ads, after every leavel too ads come and the x or close part sometime doesnt let you exit the ad or it will take you to download that other ad or app. its a really cute fun kids game. easy for my kids to play but the ads are to much of a pain,"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "I've used aldiko for years, but will now be looking for a different app. Stupid ads make it unusable. When you open the app, it now opens to an ad that won't go away. There's no way to go back or X out of it, it's just stuck there. It's a shame. What once was a good solid app is now garbage..",
            "I've had aldico premium for years and loved it. Recently I moved hundreds of ebooks to the SD card on my Samsung Galaxy tablet and now I cannot get the aldiko reader to open any of those books. I've spent hours on the internet trying to find how and I'll have to change readers if you can't resolve this for me. Thank you. Blue",
            "Come on guys. Love the app, but all the adds recently. Mostly the ones that pop up when the app starts and won't let me pass, making the app unusable. No cross to close the add, clicking on the add doesn't work either, not does pressing the back button. Forcibly closing the app and restarting just shows the same add again...",
            "I would give it a 5 star if it had a search option. since some books do not have a cover, its hard to get a book unless you search it through other mean and then choose to open with Aldiko in which case it tells you that the book has already been added. I hate that but otherwise it is a superb app",

            "Definitely NOT unlimited. From what I have read the app uses some algra rhythm to determine how many books you can listen to a month. Sometimes I am able to listen to 6, sometimes they cut me off at 4. Very frustrating. They even take the books away if you have downloaded them and make you wait until your next payment goes through. I wish they offered a truly unlimited option for the audio book portion..I would definitely pay more for truly unlimited access",
            "This monthly fee is so worth it....no late fees if you don't read the book fast enough, read without worrying about a due date, read on my phone (super convenient) and about 85% of the books I've searched for I've found (some were even books that people personally uploaded). Lately the app has been buggy. There's an option to categorize your book titles. I would like to eventually see all my titles moved only into that specific list.",
            "Can't say enough good things about this app. For $9.99 a month, I have access to at least 75% of the books I have searched for. (That estimate may be too low,) Some are audio books, some are ebooks. Sometimes I have access to both audio and ebook for the same title. Magazines, articles, and so much more. In the time of Covid, I was waiting 2-3 months for ebooks and audiobooks from my library and spending a fortune for ebooks from that site that starts with an A. SCRIBD IS GREAT.",
            "I am a big book nerd but I hate buying books online (no local bookstore) without getting to look through them. This app solves this issue! Most books I start on here, I end up buying a hard copy of. The subscription fee is totally reasonable especially since they offer lots of audiobooks. After looking into other apps, glad I pick this one.",
            "The app works great. I wish the service would just be upfront that there's a limit on non-librivox audiobooks. When they just throttle searching it makes it look like there catalog is inconsistent, and it's just generally a sneaky way to handle it. I'd much rather know the limit and budget it, just like it is with library based services."

            "Some of the puzzles are very easy, some too difficult, and a few phrases I've never heard of. Most annoying right now is that my shuffle option isn't working, and even when it did work it (as others have written) it pulled letters you'd already placed back into the mix. About four days after download I'm on level 10 and can feel myself losing interest -- app will probably be deleted within a few days.",
            "Love, love, love it! Fun yet challenging. Easy to earn coins for clues. Let's u skip around to different puzzles on the same level (until u unlock the next one). Hardly any ads! Finally a game that's worth downloading! Oh yeah, have I mentioned I love this game yet? lol WHOLEHEARTEDLY RECOMMEND!!!",

            "Pretty good word game, not many as good. Inexpensive to disable ads and i believe its worth the small cost to do so. Happy with this app and there aren't many playstore apps I can say that about."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

Some cons, It is the 1990s, not one thousand nine hundred and ninety S. It doesn't do acronyms very well. For example, FBI becomes FuhBuy. It seems to have difficulty with telling the main article from the picture description/explanation. I feel that this is a good start, and I will improve my score as they get some of those issues addressed.",

The developer (Ivan) is exceptionally responsive to support requests. I use speech Central both on Android and iOS.",

            "This is an excellent app with a host of features which are well tailored for anyone studying at home, and make learning an enjoyable and productive experience. The material is always interesting and for the most part appropriate to the stated level. The flash cards, optional pinyin and variable speed voiceovers all work well. Very good value for money!",
            "I've enjoyed learning Chinese with this app. This app has lots of texts, dialogues and stories, both long and short. Many of them are pretty entertaining. You can turn off the pinyin \"subtitles\". You can search by text difficulty. I like the ability to jump the audio fast to the sentence you press. I recommend you try the free version.",
            "So far this app has proved to be very useful to improve my Chinese level, I highly recommend it. The sorties are entertaining, the audio sounds like it's read by a real person, not a software. I'm learning new vocabulary everyday. In conclusion, the price is worth the quality. That said, the free version is still pretty good if you want to take it slow.",
            "An excellent app for learning Chinese through reading, a good bridge to being able to read web novels aimed at native speakers. I've taken a star off my rating because I can't fully turn pinyin off, only hide it. This still spaces out characters as if pinyin is present so that there are gaps in the middle of words when adjoining characters have long pinyin equivalents. Font sizes do help a little. You're also limited in what counts as a word for saving to flash cards in quite frustrating ways.",
            "Each lesson/story is segmented and a segment only contains a few sentences. You spend more time navigating than you do reading. You have to select your story/lesson, then select the segment, then confirm it. Then you get roughly 4 short sentences (often repetitive) to read before you have to do a lot more menu navigating. It's way too fiddly for limited reading content. I'm willing to pay for a good app, I subscribe to several, but this app isn't worth the exorbitant price tag of $90 a year."

            "I love this app. The Read Aloud function alone is worth the 5 * rating. In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",
            "It is a great app for read books and listen audiobooks. But in the shop section is an disadvantage. I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",
            "Just purchased an ebook. Money has been deducted from my account and the transaction is shown to be successful. Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list. I can't even request for refund as I can't track the purchase from anywhere other than my own bank account transaction record. Very much disappointed. Would like to have my money back or never to make any purchase here again."

            "I enjoy the ability to listen to a book as I drive, the only to toddler-free time I have. I love the book exchange, so I can keep the books I truly love. It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "Great game. Very suspicious when routinely you get to the third level of tournament play and tend to always lose by approximately 200 points. This is especially if you are not choosing to watch the videos. Another concern is the daily wheel- and this is not just an issue I noticed- you never get more than 20 coins no matter what. How many sections are there on the wheel? 8, 10? odds would make it so you would land on each piece every 8 to 10 days.you wouldn't go a year without getting over 20",
            "This is not a bad word game. But I wonder why I have never ever on the wheel spun and stopped on the 50 coins?!!!! ALWAYS the SMALL ones.....5, 10, 1 or whatever that very small one is!! I've been playing long enough to have at least once or twice stopped on something LARGE!! And pls don't tell me it's according to how I spin. Is there something you can do re this? Thank you.... Barbara Felton",
            "The game is very addictive and fun to play. I love how it gives you so many things to do so you never get bored! For example: There's quests, special events, league, levels and daily levels. But what's unique about this ios game is that their's barely any ads! Overall, I think this game is very fun and I recommend you install it if you have'nt already.",
            "We have played the game for years, and do enjoy the challenges. Sometimes you have words that no one in normal life would recognize, but that's where good ol' phonics comes in. But why, recently, have you changed the daily spin rewards to only 10 or 15 coins ( with a rare hint or a 20)? I've seen others comment on this, and a promise to look into it, but it doesn't seem to be getting back to the old way.",
            "I love the game BUT lately it stalls when ads pop-up and they will not go away eventho I allow them to play out. I have uninstalled several times and reinstalled to no avail. Most of the ads are USELESS to me as I am retired, will not be starting a business and/or cannot use a RX card because I have Medicare Advantage insurance. Very irritating! 10/29/2020 UPDATE: New tablet and can now play the game with no problems. Highly recommend."

            "I loved this app before the recent update!!! Before you could practice for hours and actually get somewhere with your learning. You could make mistakes and it would push you to get it right and that was so encouraging and rewarding and you felt like you were getting somewhere. Now with the hearts, as soon as you make 5 mistakes, thats it, end of session. Awful and very deflating. Yes I could pay to upgrade, but thats ¬£7 a month, over ¬£80 for a year!!!! Very very disappointed.",
            "Fix the problem when we change email, the app keeps remembering the previous email. Create the option to delete courses or organize them by preference. The heart system is terrible, remove it. The application has too many bugs for silly things, it does not load the option to follow, sometimes the audio doesn't work. I don't uninstall it because they asked me to use it at school, but this app is terrible.",
            "I can only recommend the Desk Top version of Duolingo, and even that is marginal. The mobile app is cumbersome and frustrating with having to earn and buy errors, unless you spring for the Pay version. Their slogan used to be \"Make learning fun and free.\" Wll, let me tell you, the new Hearts system is not fun. And, I think their new update is solely intended to make people buy the Plus version. Also, both versions have some of the silliest sentences to translate. Why learn them if they have no purpose? I think there are better, more efficient ways to learn a new language.",
            "The recent update to this app has made things unacceptable. The introduction of a 'hearts' system (when you get 5 things wrong in a row, you can't progress for the rest of the day) is anathema to the process of learning. What's more, I'm relatively sure the developers changed the accepted fields of words for answers smaller (phone is no longer an alternative to 'cell phone', an Americanism used nowhere outside of the United States). This is to push users into buying a subscription. Awful.",
            "Very disappointed with the update to the heart system. It's to slow people down? Then just limit the number of lessons per day instead of hearts, but allow unlimited practice sessions. I'm learning nothing now because it feels like a test and I get too much anxiety with those. Mistakes are NORMAL when learning a new language! Even those who speak a second language for many years still make mistakes. Who cares if people go too fast? Worry about those who don't and use the app appropriately]!]"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemicü§ç God Blessü§ç"

        "description": "Easy Dyslexia Aid helps with spelling and literacy with the aid of the 'OpenDyslexic' font and color overlays.\r\n\r\nThis is wonderful application and addition to the assistive technology market as it can help dyslexic learners with specific cognitive difficulties making it easier to process particular kinds of information. The absence of unnecessary 'options' pages ensures that learners with specific difficulties can quickly start using the app. \r\n\r\nDyslexia is primarily associated with trouble reading. But it can also affect writing, spelling and even speaking. Kids with dysgraphia may struggle with handwriting, organizing their thoughts on paper or with both of these activities. Easy Dyslexia Aid can support with both these conditions and serves as an extremely useful companion both inside and outside the classroom.\r\n\r\nUpon opening the application you are presented with a clear blue user-friendly interface. The instruction 'Touch mic & talk‚Äô is displayed above a circular mic symbol. On touching the symbol, you are asked to 'Talk.' By pressing done the app will process what has been said and proceed to produce your input displayed in the OpenDyslexic font. This font has been created with letters using heavy weighted bottoms to indicate direction and to reinforce the line of text, which aids in recognising the correct letter, and sometimes helps to keep the brain from rotating them around. The OpenDyslexic font is displayed in a choice of 8 color overlays, as a means to accommodate users suffering from dyslexia and improve readability. This feature can be changed in the Settings which are also easily navigated to from the main screen. Additionally, within the Settings, you can choose to turn off speech output if you wish, display upper and lower case letters and change between multiple languages.\r\n\r\nThe voice synthesis technology used is of a high standard; audio output is clear and the voice recognition software is second to none.\r\n\r\nFor many children with dyslexia or dysgraphia, asking for help with spelling can be a frustrating experience, especially in the classroom.

It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "This is my favourite note taking app ever. I like that it has the ability to name every note by the date and time, create folders and subfolders, save to card or internal memory as text, which then I can automatically back up everything in Google Drive. I guess the only option I would suggest to the developer to add to this app would be to back up automatically to Google Drive. Great work!",
            "I'm really kind of blown away at how handy this app is... It's just about perfect, I use it everyday on multiple phones and tablets... I also just used and love the recordable audio-note ability...! Hopefully in the future it will be able to do speech-to-text...! Thanks so much for your app, Peeps...",
            "Love the app, suggestions, I would love to be able to connect others to my to do list. I do hate that if I change phones I lose all my info. Love the convenience of opening up from anywhere in my phone.",
            "This app has been a nightmare, I spend hours writing, it has crashed a multitude of times now and it takes your writing with it straight to hell . I'm not happy %",
            "I would give it 5 stars, but the new update won't let me access my previous files. I have 100's of files and lost them. Used to love this app"

            "The best app to listen to Marathi and English audio books at a very affordable price. This is the only provider that has wide variety of Marathi audio books that I was not able to find anywhere else. I was only interested in Marathi books and recently Storytel added a subscription option for Marathi only content at even less monthly subscription price. That's really awesome. App is also good, never hanged or created any issues. New audio player is better than last one and I am sure the team would be improving the player further. Short stories are excellent and there are frequent new releases. These are really good if you want to have a quick fun read/listen and lighten your mood or learn something new quickly. Statistics section is also good to understand your listening habits. 5 Stars for providing us with such a good variety of audio books and podcasts. Few things that can make the app better 1- Support for web based player so that we can also use it on PC. 2- Pause the audio when there is a notification on mobile. The app currently keeps audio playing in background if there is a notification. Most of audio apps pause the audio and after the notification sound, resumes the audio 3- Increase library content for latest English audio books (there are review or summaries available for latest books but feel that there is lack of latest English content compared to other providers). 4- Separate section for podcasts and books. Right now podcasts are mixed with books which for me is bit confusing. I start listening thinking that it is a book and then realize that its actually a podcast 5- Maybe have a modern color and look for the app. Current app works great, but looks a bit outdated. Also add support for light and dark modes 6- If possible, add option to buy books so that we can keep them forever and can listen to them anytime later even if the subscription expires. Also, search feature needs improvements. If I search for something, usually there are no results. Every time I have to depend on the curated lists or book tips section to find something that I would like to listen.",
            "It seems impossible to search for anything. I would assume that I have to press the magnifying glass and then enter search terms, but nothing happens. EDIT: After further inspection, it turns out that the heading \"Search\" on top of the screen is not a heading, it becomes the search field when tapped. The big magnifying glass in the middle of the screen is not functional. Not very intuitive to me.",
            "Really good app/service. I rated 4/5 because it could use some improvements to get even better. I like that with a monthly subscription I have access to all the titles in the library - unlike other services that charge the monthly fee plus credits and/or extra money to buy the book. The selection is decent, pretty good on latest releases, but I would like to see more old books too. It would be nice if the chapters were actually named like the chapters in the book instead of just numbers.",
            "1) Too many notifications - I expect from an app I pay for to \"sit\" quietly and wait for me to decide when and if I need it, but not remind me twice a day that I have to do something with it. 2) Not user friendly - it took me some time to find the search hidden somewhere behind the menu. It was quite difficult for me to find books in English. 3) Quite limited number of books in English. At least for Bulgaria."

            "I've tried many OCR apps (image to text converter) and none of them came close to what this app produces. Although it is still not perfect yet (which is mainly because of infinite handwriting styles), at least it doesn't produce gibberish like the other apps. I hope the algorithm keeps improving and it would be great if you could add speech for other language texts too.",
            "Have been looking for an app to transcribe my handwritten notes to editable text for a while. Just downloaded this app after reading a positive review. The said OCR is by no means perfect, but then neither is my handwriting and so far I am actually pretty impressed. I like to save an image of the page to OneNote and then copy the transcribed text next to it. Would be great if I could setup a macro to do both in one go.",
            "On my galaxy s9 I am using this app in tandem with quizlet (split screen view) to create a study guide. I'm surprised I couldn't find this option on google keyboard, but this is a fine alternative. Ads are annoying but never that bad, and the very empirical way the text is transcribed is much appreciated. 5 stars for functionality, overall 4.7 because ads",
            "Top of the line, excellent for small receipts and business cards. Good for books but you might need two or three takes per page. I couldn't test it properly for handwriting during the very limited trial time allowed. Overall the development of this APP is marvelous, excellent work!",
            "This app has been a very useful tool. I'm so grateful for the intelligence put into making it. God bless you guys. Edit. Now you can't use this app without subscription. It gives you a trial period, after which, you have to subscribe to use it. It's been good while it lasted. Goodbye, I'm uninstalling now."

For example, it tells you if they are becoming forgetful or not maintaining their regular daily routines, such as remembering to take medicine. And it tells you if their physical activity is decreasing. It‚Äôs important to detect a decrease in physical activity because if they don‚Äôt receive some additional help then they could be at an increased risk of having a fall or suffer with reduced independence.\r\n\r\nThe app is technically advanced and features multiple built-in phone sensors.

In the morning it is reassuring to receive a message telling you your loved one has woken up at their regular time. And if you don‚Äôt get the message you know to call her and check everything is ok. \r\n\r\nThe app lets you setup daily recurring reminders for your loved one, for example, at 10:00 every morning your Grandfather‚Äôs phone has a notification to (say) reminder him to take medicine. And you receive a message when they do it. It helps you to see if a person is maintaining their regular daily routines.  You can set this up from your phone ‚Äì and select the reminders and tasks to appear on your loved ones phone. \r\n\r\nMobile phones and tablets offer many benefits but for some older adults they struggle to use them as part of their daily lives. Perhaps they forget to charge the battery or they don‚Äôt keep it close by for when they need it (the phone is left untouched and forgotten).  The app helps a family to support a loved one to establish and maintain a daily routine of having a phone charged and close by. The app tells you if your loved ones phone battery gets low and it tells you when they charge their phone ‚Äì so you can call and remind them if they forget to charge their phone.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed to help your elderly loved one with ‚Äòeveryday living‚Äô. The term ‚ÄòEveryday Living‚Äô is incredibly important and encompasses:  (i) remaining socially engaged; (ii) continuing with activities that give life meaning; (iii) contributing to family or community; (iv) not feeling ‚Äòburdensome‚Äô to their families; and (v) continuing the role as caregiver.\r\n\r\nThe app links phones together to create a safe private group that helps people share, care and keeps people in touch.

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

Nevertheless, it is very difficult for children to understand the concept of time as a continuum in which each event or time between events lasts for a certain period, and that it can be measured and accurately expressed in hours, minutes and seconds.\r\n\r\nThe ICT-AAC What time is it application is intended for children with developmental disabilities, but also for children of typical development, to help them understand time by displaying the duration of events in time units. Also, the purpose of the application is to enhance the connection of the number and quantity as well as it improves the understanding of sequence of events in time.\r\n\r\nUsing the app\r\n\r\nThe app offers users the ability to learn time recognition on analog and digital clocks. Therefore, there are two main game modes: learning time on a digital clock and learning time on an analog clock. By selecting one of the two options, users are shown a large clock in the middle of the screen (digital or analog, depending on the mode). Users need to recognize what time is shown on the big clock and find that time in the provided answers - clocks displayed in a different mode. This creates a connection between the digital and analog clock representations. In addition to modes, the game has several difficulty settings that are determined by the range of minutes that can occur in tasks. Therefore, the easiest tasks require the user to recognize quarters of an hour (15 minutes each) while in the most difficult tasks any combination of hours and minutes can occur.",

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

            "Poor user interface: It requires three taps before you're able to start entering a word to look up (which surely must be the primary use case by far). It has no fuzzy lookup (e.g.. soundex). If you don't know how the word is spelled, you can't look it up.",
            "The free version of the free dictionary blows premium paid MW out of the water. I have premium mw and thesaurus and just purchased the premium version of the free dictionary. There is no comparison. Its not just my preference, TFD is demonstrably superior.",

Tried to contact them but the have no direct message. There is no use playing if you're going to cheat me out of the winnings. Also need to work on the words. There have been many words that you say no that are.....",
            "Great game which is addictive, I play this all the time because it is simple yet fun. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because there is one improvement which would be good to see in this game; and that would be an option to change colours of the block and background. Having played the game more 100s of times, seeing the same colours does make it dull. If this small update was implemented, it would make a huge difference.",
            "I am giving this a low rating because of all the ads and the fact that you can get rid of them for 4 bucks but thats just for 30 days. Seriously???? Also the landscape never changes even though in the ad it showed green grass which looked cool. Shame on you devs. Where are the levels in the pictures and trailer? It's a great game but it's the same thing over amd over again.",
            "Not what was advertised when It was an ad, I saw ad and was like woah that looks like a fun little game so I downloaded quickly without investigating, only to find this completely different game so for that I give a 1star. But it's a fun game so 5 star. DO NOT LIKE BEING TRICKED HOWEVER. Shame on you if you're in control of false advertising. But a fun game so I'm conflicted.",
            "The music is peace allowing you to think ,no time presure,which allows you to relax,and the background pic is beautiful. No ads intrupt while your trying to think.So if you like block puzzles I highly recommed trying this one."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

        "description": "Talk To Me 100¬Æ Lite (free version) is a powerful, engaging tool for children who are learning to talk, or who have difficulty mastering verbal expression. An interactive teaching device, Talk To Me 100¬Æ allows the child - by pressing buttons - to see words, hear words, understand their meaning and experience the joy of communication. Using the pinch and swipe gestures, the board can be expanded and moved on the tablet as needed. This Free Version offers 9 of the most frequently used symbols and sounds. The full version is priced at $5.99 and offers 100 symbols and corresponding sounds.\r\n\r\nThe Talk To Me 100¬Æ Android App was developed by a Speech and Language Pathologist as a way to facilitate error-less communication (in which the learner never fails, but is supported in all communication attempts) to teach beginning language skills.\r\n\r\nThis new voice output app helps parents, teachers and therapists jump-start verbal expression for children who are struggling to communicate.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ allows the learner to control their environment, and to signal the point of readiness to communicate. Talk To Me 100¬Æ also provides immediate and consistent feedback, allows for practice and repetition of 100 frequently used words throughout daily activities, provides fun and enjoyment and lets the learner become accustomed to touch screen use.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ is designed to provide communication partners with 100 words organized in a predictable format to use in an unlimited choice of daily activities. Sydspeak created this app for children with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, speech and language disorders and other special needs. Talk To Me 100¬Æ provides communication partners with a core vocabulary to begin verbal expression for all functions of language: imitate, comment, answer, question, describe, retell, accept, reject, repeat, command, request, explain, persuade, maintain social relationship and influence.\r\n\r\nThe adult communication partner models one or more words by selecting the buttons and using their natural voice to speak the same words whether you are getting ready for school, eating dinner, reading or playing outside; opportunities for verbal interaction are unlimited.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ provides a beginning augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) solution for people who have difficulty speaking. Once the learner begins to combine 2-3 words spontaneously to communicate a new or novel thought, they are well on their way to using more than 100 words, either using natural voice or using a more expanded and dynamic AAC device.\r\n\r\nThis Android app is a digital replica and companion to the original ‚Äúchild friendly‚Äù Talk To Me 100¬Æ available at www.sydspeak.com. Priced at $59, this tablet is similar in size and comes in a durable plastic case with 3AAA batteries. Research shows that when each communication partner uses their own personal voice output device, language acquisition is more efficient. For some children, a predictable pattern of images on a computer screen using the same child‚Äôs voice has more impact than pictures on paper with changing adult verbal interactions. For the first time, we now have a powerful communication system where both partners can have their own affordable and effective language device with the same voice and symbols.\r\n\r\nThe free version offers a sample of beginning language learning.\r\n\r\nI recently evaluated a 3 year old child who was nonverbal. His parents said he only spoke 2 words: ‚Äúmama‚Äù and ‚Äúbye‚Äù. When presented with the Talk To Me 100¬Æ, he began exploring the board, pressing the symbols and listening to the words. I began using my version on the tablet, and he immediately began imitating my words by pressing the symbols on his device. What sometimes takes months of therapy to achieve, he was imitating words within a few minutes!!!",

I've seen truth in some predictions about things they couldn't possibly have known, some yet to be seen. I wish there was a way to send a response message simply to say thanks (not ask another question) without \"spending\" a question. Also, can advisors message clients first? Like, if we've built a rapport, and they want to check in or feel compelled to tell us something?",

Everything that I thought was already fixed, I now see differently by using this app. A true revelation and, therefore, a definite recommendation to buy from me!",

Not with this app, an excellent help team immediately got involved, explained everything to me in detail and nicely, and they waited until it worked again, and I gave my OK. Many thanks again for that. Great team!",
            "You can only answer general questions. Thing's they can say & no too.. there a list stuff on help section that tell you what your not allowed to ask! ( you have to look for it ) nowhere on buying a questions does it say what your not allowed to ask.. the options was family hence why I asked about pregancy ( which most physic/spiritual people can answer or give a rough idea ) but it a questions your not allows to ask..",

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

            "It's a good vocab app. I especially like it since it brings together high-frequency words of different words. However, I couldn't find the quiz questions impressive. They needs to customise the quiz answer options with more variety and words with nearby but confusing meanings.",
            "1. Lists of words are good. 2. People suggest quite good mnemonics to remember words. 3. Recommendation to developers: Add category of words whether it is noun, adjective, verb or adverb (it will help readers using word in a sentence)",
            "It's a good app. Everything is perfect. But only a thing is missing. There should be parts of speech beside every word. It'd be more helpful if we are able to know the parts of speech of the word.",
            "Wonderful app. However, if I search a word, I don't understand under which button the word belongs to. For an example, I searched for ' surreptitiously ' and I found it but I don't where it belongs. Whether, magoosh 1000 or Barron's 333. I can swipe right and left and there are so many words. But the minute I exit, I can't find them. It is not possible to find the word before going through all the available options. Which is quite demanding... Nevertheless, it is an absolute gem of an app.",
            "A very good and interesting app for GRE. However I don't understand what you mean by 'high frequency' word 'medium frequency' or 'low frequency '. Are you saying how they appear often on GRE?"

            "The preference settings do not work. You will be shown people 1000s of km away. They try to say it's a filter thing, as if I would not be smart enough to test out if my filters were the limiting factor. Not 1 user of *any* broadly defined \"filter parameter\" exists in my city of 1.6 M ppl. If I use the premium \"global search\" feature (which does in fact exist) to then search any specified area, it will ALWAYS show people far away from that area. This problem is not on my end.",
            "The app is a scam, free version gets you nothing but spam, paid version they literally just took my money and didn't provide the premium service, which I paid for 1 year. When I contacted customer support over this, they stated they do not have any payment on file. Proof was provided, and the customer service responded with \"sorry nothing we can do\"",
            "Can only upload pics from the camera app on the device, or Facebook. The pics I want to use don't exist on either, so pretty much useless. Edit: thanks for the tip, but that's definitely not the issue. I haven't even tried uploading because I can't access the pics I want to use. They're not on Facebook or my phone's camera app.",
            "This app is truly terrible. On first impressions a few months ago I had more faith in the app because I was surprised with how many people were shown living at least 20-50 miles from my area. But now after you've viewed somewhere in the 200s of people's accounts near your area, they suddenly can only show people who live almost 100 miles away from you, regardless of how long you've been off the app for. Don't know if they stop showing new accounts near us on purpose or just a glitch....Just sad",
            "Waste of time. There's no matches anywhere close no matter what you set the radius for. They were unhelpful with contacting saying to just restart the app and that if there aren't people near me that the default is to ignore the radius.... I don't want to talk to someone 700 miles away. And they try to make you pay for everything! Just wow."

But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ‚ô°",

            "Tempo doesn't work correctly. It's acknowledged as a 'preference' in the help section. It's not a preference. It's math. Edit: 10/30/2020. I've given you an actual proof for why your app is dysfunction and inaccurate. Still no response. As a reminder, 1/1 @ 400bpm != 8/8 @ 400bpm. This decision saved your developers a lot of memory, but it made the app dysfunctional. üëé",
            "The app is great and recent firmware works great with the watch. But unless I turn on GPS it won't send notifications. Clearly not a connection issue since the metronome works perfectly with GPS turned off... If you want to collect all the data just require google account but don't burn my phone battery for notifications access",

Kids, parents and teachers can use it to create your own story with pictures, video, sounds and text-to-speech. From kindergarten circle to special education, anyone can benefit from this new way of expressing memories and ideas.\r\n\r\nEach story is organized in pages with a picture, video and text. The pages can have a sound clip attached or text-to-speech interpretation. The  pictures and sounds can  be selected from device albums or recorded instantly. A draw and handwriting pad is available for Samsung Galaxy / Note S Pen. The stories can be added and edited with an easy to use  wizard. Fun effects can be added with the integrated Aviary photo editor. The stories can be saved as PDF and e-mailed. The entire story can also be shared by email with other Show And Tell users.\r\n\r\nThe application is particularly useful for teachers, therapists and parents. It allows for quick creation of personalized sequenced stories,  with the possibility of introducing own phots, video, text and audio recording. The application is best suited for young children or children with reduced speech clarity, learning disabilities, autism, behavior difficulties, developmental disabilities and/or emerging  language abilities (nonverbal communication, speech therapy).\r\n \r\nShow and Tell provides the adults working with the children a tool to stimulate language, including comprehension, oral  expressive skills, reading and writing skills. The app can be used to create social narratives to depict common social problems or conflicts  and ways to address them in a socially acceptable way. The app allows for maximum flexibility on the part of the adult designing the story  for the child. For example, if the teacher chose to draw small figurines on paper to depict emotions and actions, then a picture can be taken and ‚Äúvoila‚Äù, a story was created which can then be used over and over again, until the target behavior is learned. \r\n\r\nThe app allows the user to create sequenced stories which are often key for early language and literacy development. The stories created can  be used to expand conversations, introducing the story elements to the child or introducing more details and richness to the  conversational exchange. \r\n\r\nThe stories can be used to support children with severe articulation disorders, oral language difficulties, nonverbal or autistic children.  The parents or teacher may create simple stories to depict an activity that the child has done, then use the app to allow the child to share  the information with others, familiar or unfamiliar peers and adults, in order to expand the range of people that the child communicates with. \r\n\r\nIf the focus is on Vocabulary and concept development, the teacher or parent may take pictures of multiple objects depicting a concept that is a focus for the child  (such as colors, numbers, sizes, etc), then create a quick story for the child to refer to. \r\n\r\nThe app may be used to create early literacy individualized alphabet books to aid children who are struggling to make the connection between  the letters and their respective sounds through association with pictures of personally meaningful things. For example, the book of B may  include several pictures of favorite items of the child that start with B, such as ball, bananas, beaver tails. A familiar voice recording would increase familiarity  and ensure faster connections are made.  \r\n\r\nChildren with working memory difficulties may benefit from the stories created with Show and Tell to replay a sequence of familiar events for quick reference. For example, a child may use a story which replays the steps required to do a pen and paper exercise in class or homework. \r\n \r\nThis is a demo version.

Actually I thought of dwonloading other game but your game has make me intelligent üòã and it's interesting while I'm doing nothing but your game has a feeling that makes me happy because I answer and the game asked haha Btw the best is the multiplication stage ahh it's sad that now people doesn't have time to play like your game but other shooting games like PUBG but still this is the best game ever.

Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

This sensory play activity is guaranteed to provide them with joy and entertainment! Ideal for when you‚Äôre out and about and your infant is getting bored or upset, when your toddler won‚Äôt settle and getting up to mischief or when you just want to relax your child before bed time ‚Äì distract and get their attention with some visual stimulation in a joyful way\r\n\r\nThis sensorial app has many unique features in comparison with other sensory based games, such as the firework, bubble, balloon pop and finger paint games available. Choose to amuse your baby with this visually stimulating, interactive, sensory game\r\n\r\nNot only will this sensory app delight your kids, it will also provide increased educational benefits. From the early stages of your babies development, they are constantly learning and absorbing information around them, they begin to see, touch, feel, hear and understand how their interactions are affecting the environment around them. Your baby, infant, child, kid or toddler will begin to learn that touching the screen will cause bubbles to be created. Your child can drag your finger across the screen to create a pattern of bubbles. Your newborn can place their hands on the screen to cause lots of bubbles to be created at all points on the screen that they are touching.\r\n\r\nWith sensory fish, your child will experience and educate themselves by use of the cause and effect techniques and features implemented. As your babies or toddlers touch the screen, they gain instant feedback of a vibration, sound effects and bubbles. They will eventually begin to understand that their touch is also causing the fish to swim towards where they touched the screen. If they were to touch the screen in multiple position, the fish will swim between all of those touched positions! Your baby learns and adapts to their findings within the game\r\n\r\nAs the game is fairly simple to understand and not too complex, it is ideal for young children of ages from 0 months (with a parent showing them the game), up to the late preschool stage of their development where they fully understand and can control all aspects of the world and have learned exactly what the cause will be from their actions\r\n\r\nSensory game play is great for the continued development of your children‚Äôs motor skills and hand eye coordination development. It aids in helping to fine tuning the motoric skills and movements, the very detailed movements that we require and use every day\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown to have great benefits in learning and stimulation for children with autism and children with special educational needs (SEN). Having already received excellent feedback from parents who have children with autism, special educational needs (SEN) and learning disabilities\r\n\r\nSensory Play Features: \r\n‚Ä¢ Vibration on touching the game screen\r\n‚Ä¢ Sound Effects on touching the game screen \r\n‚Ä¢ Choose from multiple effects that are created where ever the game screen is touched (bubbles, starfish, fireworks)\r\n‚Ä¢ Choose between a selection of backgrounds\r\n‚Ä¢ Choose from a selection of scenes (reef, shipwreck etc)\r\n‚Ä¢ Control where the fish swim to, includes multi touch support\r\n‚Ä¢ Gyro support - as your device is rotated, the game world rotates with it\r\n‚Ä¢ Game screen lock ‚Äì prevention from accidentally exiting the game (uses screen pinning)\r\n‚Ä¢ Different fish to choose from, all with varying contrasting colors, you can also choose multiple fish types to play with at the same time. Now including sea horses and turtles!\r\n\r\nInstall now! It‚Äôs convenient, educational, stimulating and fun. With no ads to interrupt your child‚Äôs fun",

Your newborn can place their hands on the screen to cause lots of bubbles to be created at all points on the screen that they are touching.<br><br>With sensory fish, your child will experience and educate themselves by use of the cause and effect techniques and features implemented. As your babies or toddlers touch the screen, they gain instant feedback of a vibration, sound effects and bubbles. They will eventually begin to understand that their touch is also causing the fish to swim towards where they touched the screen. If they were to touch the screen in multiple position, the fish will swim between all of those touched positions! Your baby learns and adapts to their findings within the game<br><br>As the game is fairly simple to understand and not too complex, it is ideal for young children of ages from 0 months (with a parent showing them the game), up to the late preschool stage of their development where they fully understand and can control all aspects of the world and have learned exactly what the cause will be from their actions<br><br>Sensory game play is great for the continued development of your children‚Äôs motor skills and hand eye coordination development. It aids in helping to fine tuning the motoric skills and movements, the very detailed movements that we require and use every day<br><br>It has also been shown to have great benefits in learning and stimulation for children with autism and children with special educational needs (SEN).

        "description": "One of the most effective treatment methods for borderline and trauma related disorders is the Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (DBT-PTSD). It effectively treats PTSD and borderline. \r\n\r\nMorpheus is the app that assists DBT-PTBS treatment and all forms of therapy that use exposures.\r\n\r\nMorpheus was developed together with the inventor of DBT-PTSD, researchers of the Central Institute of Mental Health and their patients. Read our scientific publication about the app in the JMIR Journal (2016): http://mental.jmir.org/2016/2/e27/\r\n\r\nNo matter if you are in treatment for borderline, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), etc. Morpheus supports various forms of trauma therapy, such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), as well as in a dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) setting.\r\n\r\nFeatures: 1) Record the therapy session with your therapist and listen to it again later to process what you have experienced. 2) Assess your feelings before, after and during listening. 3) See the course of therapy in your statistics. 4) You can stop listening at any time to change your mind through mini-games. \r\n\r\nWarning: Morpheus is intended to be used within a therapy guided by a qualified expert. Morpheus is not meant to be used without such professional psychotherapy. We strongly advise against using Morpheus for \"self-therapy\". Morpheus is not a replacement for a therapist. For more information read the following section about Morpheus' purpose definition.\r\n\r\nPurpose definition\r\nThis section describes the differentiation of Morpheus from a medical device, specifically from a medical app, by a purpose definition according to ¬ß3 No.10 MPG. The differentiation is based on the guidance provided by the BfArM.\r\n\r\nWhat Morpheus is intended for\r\n+ Morpheus stores audio recordings made by the user. This function is intended for use during a psychotherapy session, subject to the consent of the persons present. The recording is archived by Morpheus so that the user can listen to it again later to remember the previous therapy session.\r\n+ Morpheus stores user self-assessments before, after and during listening to an archived audio recording. These self-assessments serve two different purposes: (i) The assessment before and after listening is archived and displayed to the user to provide motivating feedback to the user about his or her feelings during the course of the therapy. With the user's consent, the therapist can gain insight into the self-assessments collected. This data is only communicated, no treatment recommendation is derived based on this data. (ii) The assessment during the listening is used to offer the user a distraction when a certain value is exceeded, so that he or she can distance him- or herself from what he or she has just heard. The user can reject the offer and continue listening.\r\n\r\nWhat Morpheus is not intended for\r\nMorpheus does not meet the criteria used to classify a medical app according to ¬ß3 No. 1 MPG. The purpose of Morpheus is not intended for:\r\n- Detection, prevention, surveillance, treatment or alleviation of disease,\r\n- Detection, monitoring, treatment, relief or compensation of injuries or disabilities,\r\n- Examination, replacement or modification of the anatomical structure or a physiological process,\r\n- Conception control.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the purpose of Morpheus is not intended for: \r\n- Decision support or independent decision making, e.g. with regard to therapeutic measures,\r\n- Calculation e.g. of drug dosages (in contrast to the pure reproduction of a table from which the user derives the dosage himself),\r\n- Monitoring of a patient and data collection, e.g. by recording measured values, if the results influence diagnosis or therapy.",

For more information read the following section about Morpheus&#39; purpose definition.<br><br>Purpose definition<br>This section describes the differentiation of Morpheus from a medical device, specifically from a medical app, by a purpose definition according to ¬ß3 No.10 MPG. The differentiation is based on the guidance provided by the BfArM.<br><br>What Morpheus is intended for<br>+ Morpheus stores audio recordings made by the user. This function is intended for use during a psychotherapy session, subject to the consent of the persons present. The recording is archived by Morpheus so that the user can listen to it again later to remember the previous therapy session.<br>+ Morpheus stores user self-assessments before, after and during listening to an archived audio recording. These self-assessments serve two different purposes: (i) The assessment before and after listening is archived and displayed to the user to provide motivating feedback to the user about his or her feelings during the course of the therapy. With the user&#39;s consent, the therapist can gain insight into the self-assessments collected. This data is only communicated, no treatment recommendation is derived based on this data. (ii) The assessment during the listening is used to offer the user a distraction when a certain value is exceeded, so that he or she can distance him- or herself from what he or she has just heard. The user can reject the offer and continue listening.<br><br>What Morpheus is not intended for<br>Morpheus does not meet the criteria used to classify a medical app according to ¬ß3 No. 1 MPG. The purpose of Morpheus is not intended for:<br>- Detection, prevention, surveillance, treatment or alleviation of disease,<br>- Detection, monitoring, treatment, relief or compensation of injuries or disabilities,<br>- Examination, replacement or modification of the anatomical structure or a physiological process,<br>- Conception control.<br><br>Furthermore, the purpose of Morpheus is not intended for: <br>- Decision support or independent decision making, e.g. with regard to therapeutic measures,<br>- Calculation e.g. of drug dosages (in contrast to the pure reproduction of a table from which the user derives the dosage himself),<br>- Monitoring of a patient and data collection, e.g. by recording measured values, if the results influence diagnosis or therapy.",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "Freezes up every time try to check week time clock and scroll through jobs. Makes checking in a pain in the a$$ Update... 3 updates in the few weeks and still bugs. I'm not able to balance out my crew because I cant check week totals. All these changes to this app are making me want to find a new program.",
            "Ever since they updated with qb security, it takes way too long to log in. Why do I need a verification code EVERY TIME I log in! It's as bad as QuickBooks now. My bank doesn't require a verification code every single time and they are infinitely way more important than QuickBooks or Tsheets. You guys act like you need this much security. Qb is a terrible company. I hope I find another service soon so I can dump them.",
            "After the Tsheets has joined with Intuit it has locked myself and most of my staff out. As we use it for payroll you can imagine the headache. Periodic downtimes, schedule duplication if you have it on separate devices, or making changes that simply disappear are all common issues. Not clocking out or back in or from job to job is an issue for the field as well. I and my office spend more time on this app than needed to. Use another service.",
            "So far this app has been great. Only had it crash once, but once the update came in it was fixed. The only tiny issue i have now is when i clock in it delays a minute before clocking me in causing me to be a minute late. However i'm not entirely sure if that's the app or just my phone.",
            "Horrible since Quickbooks bought the company. I have been a Tsheets user for 3 years. Before QB, it was wonderful and had immediate phone support. QB's made changes to login and have to generate a QB account and even then they email you a verification code every time you try and login. There is no longer any telephone support and have pushed everyone to online chat. My last chat experience took 38 minutes to get a hold of someone."

A really nice app and I recommend this for every student. If u feel like a lot of ads are disturbing you, you can just switch off the internet connection. Works with my phone, not sure if it works with yours.ü§î",
            "I'm so happy that you add the feature that you can collect coin in every correct answer and buy another option. The app itself is great buttons are well made, no delay and no lag. Speaking of adds, i don't have problem with it. Speaking of 'tricks' I already mastered some of those and can actually solve mentally. Ps: I just used it for one day. How much more If i use this for so long? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP. For developer of this app. I want you all to congratulate for this masterpiece. Gb",
            "1. When you finish a single game, the app shows you how to solve the problem, but it doesn't show what type of problem this solution works for, and instead of the title, the score appears. 2. You can add a solution to the square equation according to Vieta's theorem.",
            "It's an amazing app! It teaches you how to solve math questions in the simplest and easiest way and also tests you on what you have learnt. This is really an app I'll recommend if you want to improve your marks in mathematics and take it into a whole new level! The best part about it is that it is free! Hats off to the developer for creating this wonderful app. üòÑüòÑüòÑ",
            "It's a mind blowing app. I'll recommend every one to install the app. It comprises of millions of tricks, which are really helpful. It also contains many Maths problems, which help us to understand the tricks better. It contains Maths games and multiplication table. Thanks a lot to the app developer for developing this outstanding app."

            "Very supportive and responsive support. App has an easy to use UI for communication and seems to be quite customizable. The PIN function to restrict changes to settings is very useful. It does install all images locally but that also allows the app full functionality even when not connected to the internet. The app comes with multiple different page layouts on installation, and has the ability to create custom pages as well. However, I did have to explore myself the various settings and options available in the app, and how they changed the functionality and interface of the app. The degree of customization is great, such as custom buttons with personal images and sound recordings for true personalization of expression but these options can feel a little overwhelming for those that are unfamiliar with AAC apps or communication apps in general. Some sort of in app onboarding to help new users customize the app to their communication needs where new users can view the default page types/layouts easily when they first start the app, and a help/guide function or library explaining the different options available to users as far as customization and control goes would be very helpful. If there is a manual included in the application, it is not easily located. Otherwise, this app suits our needs perfectly, and I would definitely recommend this app.",

We've been using Proloquo2go for years and with each new version it is increasingly difficult to use, NO customer support in the US, and is so ridiculously expensive.

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so üíØ happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 üåü is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this app is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòòüòò"

I've rebooted my phone, I've cleared my cache, I've turned off my VPN, I've cleared my junk files and my residual files with Norton Clean, and I've deleted the game and reloaded it, NOTHING WORKS.",
            "At first it was okay, $4.99 packs then $19.99 packs to help you advance, now mostly everything is $100 packs. I also notice that they were giving more hero energy and loyalty points to help you out in the game now you barly get loyalty points and you hardly ever get hero energy. They don't sell shields so you have to buy them with loyalty points but how can you buy them with loyalty points if you hardly win enough to buy the shield so you constantly get attacked and have your hero taken. üëé",
            "Have played this game for a number of years getting very discouraged game will load for a day then close spontaneously during the loading process. They tell me its my phone but when others have the same issue. I'm seeing they only want money not fix the issues I'm down grading my stars to a 2 because of technical issues without fixes and it has evolved to a pay to play, pay to win game.",
            "Use to be a Good game but you can't advance without buying a pack now. The developer has to lower those prices not everyone can afford $99.00 a pop for a Pack especially nowadays Put up some $5 or $10 deals like other game do so the rest of us can advance too... Its a google play game guys Stop being greedy for money listen to the reviews players not happy with the game anymore.",
            "I played this game all the time on my samsung phones. Very fun game to keep up with. Now I'm on my oneplus 7 pro and nothing loads other than the all text boxes and buildings. I can't transfer my account because I don't know what I'm pressing. This is one of few games I have spent money on, I'd like to not lose that account."

You have challanges to test your skills. Also highlights the code professionally. brackets and inverted commas start and end at once. If the select one bracket the other one Instantly gets selected.however there is one problem for which I did not rate five stars. I cannot import or export the projects as separate file.",

The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.üëçüëçüëç",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game.

            "amazing bank. love the instant notifications and easy direct deposits. very simple to use. Update: 10/20 Go with a real bank. This bank enjoys doing random maintenance on all accounts. Completely disabling your account for DAYS at a time. So far my account has been disabled for 2 days. There's plenty of money in my account, I just can't use any of it. Dropped to 3 stars simply because it's a free bank account. That's the only good thing about Chime. Its free. They just control your money.",
            "My experience with Chime overall has been a great one. Instead of getting paid on Fridays, I get paid on Wednesdays every week via direct deposit. Two days early! Chime also offers the SpotMe feature, which is basically overdraft protection with no fees. Another cool feature for this being a virtual bank, is you have the option to set up a Secured Credit Builder Card with no pre-set credit limit, up to $10,000. I'm on the waitlist right now, but from what I read, it sounds very helpful!",
            "More honest review today, today marks the third time in two months that time bank has frozen, has had technical difficulties and has no one available to up to talk to customers for hours on end. Now yes time is convenient, but there are other cards like it on the market. Which I am now starting to look into, as well as brick and mortar building type banks because unfortunately I can't let this keep happening especially not during the holiday season.",
            "I have had this mobile banking app for over 6 years and haven't had any problems but recently their have been outages causing the app to be unavailable and my money unusable! I'm extremely furious that they can't keep their app working properly so I can use MY MONEY! Currently waiting for the app to be available so I can take my money and go to another bank! This is outrageous and you get no compensation for the late payments or overall difficulty of not being able to use YOUR MONEY!",
            "I would be rating this higher, but for some reason I am not being shown a history of my purchases on the app. My girlfriend doesn't seem to be having this issue, only me. I have double checked to ensure that I have the most recent update, which I do. I cannot determine the cause for this. Any advice or assistance would be appreciated. The 'support bot' has not been any help at all. Thanks."

            "Great game...BUT! Had issues with this game a year ago, but thought I'd give it another go. Graphics and game play are excellent, however I bought credits (AU$70), bet big, won free games (Where's The Gold) then the game froze. Restarted it, recovered the game then froze again. Restarted it, same thing. Third time it just took the free games. No reply from support. You bet big with the hope of winning free games, then it takes away your prize.",
            "This app has the best graphics....but thats it. I've tried buying credits etc to 'pay my way' for better payouts, but all Product Madness are concerned about is making you pay more for something worthless. There is no way you can win any money back, its supposed to be for fun, but you have to pay big ongoing premiums to have any 'fun'. Until l see a better return on the money I've paid so far, they'll not get another penny out of me. You are better off saving your money for real gambling.",
            "I keep wanting to give this game more stars, but they just wont let me. Yes I'm very happy that you put way better values on the daily wheel. Yes I play this game because the games are ones I've played in real casinos...i can't give more than one star because you just make it impossible to win anything...when you go through 5 million coins betting minimum and never get a bonus or win anything higher than double your bet you just want to give up. Plus, the cost of buying coins is ridiculous.",
            "I think its great , you know it costs them money to put these games on here, so to anyone that's not happy just remember these games are free, and entertaining , And it takes our minds off of today's problems, Tomas blanco",
            "Total scam. Fixed games and they expect you to pay for credits? Games don't pay, stupid and totally unnecessary side games (open boxes for items or scratch fixed lottery tickets). The only good thing about this app is that the games look like the real deal but the overall experience is terrible."

        "title": "GG Relationship Doubt & Obsessions (ROCD)",
        "description": "Created by Dr. Guy Doron (IDC), clinical psychologist and researcher\r\nFeel like you're missing out on the perfect relationship? Finding it hard to commit? Experiencing constant doubts? Suffering from obsessive thinking? Want to expand your mind and make it more adaptive? GGRO is here to help!\r\n\r\nRELIEVING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS POSSIBLE\r\nThrow away negative thoughts. Approach positive ones. Learn to identify your inner self talk and respond quickly. Train daily and improve your wellness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk ‚Äì individuals‚Äô ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, ROCD and maladaptive thinking. \r\n\r\nHOW DO I MANAGE MY ROCD?\r\nThe foundations of a healthy mind are built upon flexible beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that ‚Äúmy partner has to be perfect‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have to be 100% certain about my partner‚Äú - I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my ability to deal with relationships will decrease.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our well being.\r\n\r\nHOW GG APPS WORK\r\nThe application is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of negative and obsessive thoughts.\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts.\r\n3. Increase your access to neutral, adaptive and positive thoughts.\r\n4. Increase the accessibility of the above processes.\r\n5. Provide daily mood and self esteem boost.\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining healthy thinking during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and relationship OCD.\r\n\r\nTRAIN YOUR THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe longer we train making it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your mind‚Äôs flexibility, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts). Users are required to complete a random set of 'blocks' to complete the level.\r\n\r\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, embarrassment, uncertainty, commitment anxiety, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, distrust, fear of abandonment, and more.\r\n\r\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle of obsessive thinking.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I COMPLETED ALL THE LEVELS?\r\nThe key to using the app is learning new topics, but even more importantly - training daily. There are levels designed as \"daily training\" for you to play once you completed your base course.\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS\r\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\r\n\r\nOTHER APPS BY GG\r\nGG OCD Training App\r\nGG Body Image Distress & Preoccupation\r\nGG Confidence & Self esteem\r\nGood Blocks",

Train daily and improve your wellness.<br><br><b>SCIENCE BACKED</b><br>New findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.<br>According to CBT models, negative self talk ‚Äì individuals‚Äô ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, ROCD and maladaptive thinking. <br><br><b>HOW DO I MANAGE MY ROCD?</b><br>The foundations of a healthy mind are built upon flexible beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that ‚Äúmy partner has to be perfect‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have to be 100% certain about my partner‚Äú - I won&#39;t be able to live up to these expectations and my ability to deal with relationships will decrease.<br><br><b>BELIEFS AND SELF TALK</b><br>Beliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our well being.<br><br><b>HOW GG APPS WORK</b><br>The application is designed to:<br>1. Increase your awareness of negative and obsessive thoughts.<br>2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts.<br>3. Increase your access to neutral, adaptive and positive thoughts.<br>4. Increase the accessibility of the above processes.<br>5. Provide daily mood and self esteem boost.<br><br><b>IS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?</b><br>Our app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:<br>1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.<br>2. It helps in maintaining healthy thinking during or after therapy.<br>3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and relationship OCD.<br><br><b>TRAIN YOUR THOUGHTS</b><br>The basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.<br>The longer we train making it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.<br> <br><b>HOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?</b><br>To feel better and improve your mind‚Äôs flexibility, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.<br><br>LEVELS AND TOPICS<br>The app&#39;s many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts). Users are required to complete a random set of &#39;blocks&#39; to complete the level.<br><br>The topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, embarrassment, uncertainty, commitment anxiety, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, distrust, fear of abandonment, and more.<br><br>Training using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle of obsessive thinking.<br><br>WHAT IF I COMPLETED ALL THE LEVELS?<br>The key to using the app is learning new topics, but even more importantly - training daily. There are levels designed as &quot;daily training&quot; for you to play once you completed your base course.<br><br><b>LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS</b><br>Visit our website: http://ggapps.net<br><br><b>OTHER APPS BY GG</b><br>GG OCD Training App<br>GG Body Image Distress &amp; Preoccupation<br>GG Confidence &amp; Self esteem<br>Good Blocks",

However, I love this app. I find it stimulations in areas, for me, that I haven't experienced yet or at least helps me to identify problem areas in which to manage them. I love that it is available. It makes me feel content in knowing that regardless of how I feel.. there's still some positive type of response for me to read or engage and thayd helpful.",
            "I guess it's an ok app/game. Pretty boring. All you do is swipe positive affirmations one way and negative ones the other way. There is no \"training\" or anything, no advice or tips or anything like that.",
            "I was initially embarrassed to try this app and asked myself why anyone would admit to needing this kind of thing by giving a review. But oh my goodness!! This app is wonderful. It conditions the mind to think positively and embrace resilience and that is a beautiful thing. My husband is trying it now, too, and likes it as well. It has helped me already to have a more positive outlook and improved the way I relate to others. I wouldn't have believed it without trying it. So grateful!!",
            "I've definitely seen improvement in managing my thoughts and it's really nice to see an app specifically for rocd. I'm docking a star simply because a $20 pay wall is extreme.",
            "I was unsure at first because some of the exercises *could* (potentially, in certain situations) make things more difficult, if the relationship is abusive, for instance. *HOWEVER*, assuming that the person using the app does not have an abusive partner and is aware of their own weaknesses, I have found this app to be helpful. It definitely helps with intrusive, obsessive thoughts that sometimes creep into my head for no reason. And it helps me keep my crazy under wraps, lol"

Honestly don't waste your time on this game.",

Think it is time to get some new devs. How long has this been going on (seems like longer than 2 months) and still no fix/action. Worked ok for a couple of weeks then boom, just get a black screen when trying to load, still only 1 star, would give 0 if I could",

Had to restart from level 1! Why would anybody do that? Instead install another puzzle game which are aplenty on Play Store"

            "Solid game but with a few serious flaws. First, the workshop doesn't produce nearly enough components for you to actually have enough to buy anything. Second, the loot boxes are complete scams and it's impossible to get anything better than the worst few prizes. Last, they expect WAY too much of the player. It's a mobile game guys, people aren't going to spend all day playing it, so don't make limited time prizes that require 300 wins (50 hours of only winning games) in a few days.",
            "Not bad but after the first few levels you will be massively overmatched by people that spend money on the game. And the cost of buying into the game is insanely high. $99.99 for 1 robot, 1 gun and 1 pilot when you have slots for 5 robots with 4 guns apiece? You could end up paying as much as buying a high end gaming PC playing this \"free\" game.",
            "Used to be a fun game. Now it's a \"pay or keep losing game.\" And they keep coming up with exotic robots with weird abilities and weapons. Would be awesome if they would create an \"Old School Mode\" for players who just want ro play for fun, not world domination. But I guess they won't make money that way.",
            "This is an extremely fun game, but P2W is beyond imagination. Titans completely ruin the game as they can completely annihilate 3-4 of your own regular bots. The matchmaking is terrible since if you don't have a titan they will still match you with one. The amount of real money you need to invest in this game is out of this world. Grab $500 or months of patient misery to be competitive. Nerf titans or don't play this game. It's like putting college players against peewee kids in any sport. Lol",
            "I have years of experience with WR now and can base my opinions on this. Like any mobile game, pay to win is an issue. With skill, you can match them. I have never bought anything and I am pushing for promotion back to expert after the rebalance. Anything in the game you will eventually be able to make or buy for silver, after it spends some time being exclusive. The graphics have gone wierd after remastered dropped, they looked a lot better before. If I have a gripe, it's that."

            "Look. It works and is effective. However. For the sake of going in educated, know that if you don't know how to unsubscribe via Google Play, Norton is going to make finding out a bad time. They deliberately force you to make an account, force you to share details to contact support, and deliberately provide no information on how to unsubscribe from the service. That type of behavior says a LOT about the ethics of a company. Be aware before making a commitment.",
            "I mainly got this Norton app for the excellent call blocking features... everything else was just a plus. Now, a message on the app indicates the call blocking feature will be discontinued in a future update so that Norton can add some \"exciting new features.\" Nothing could be exciting enough without being able to block calls! I'll finish out the year I paid for and then move to something else....for free!",
            "I have never had the real time fraud and spam call alerts since I've installed the Norton 360 app, I wish it would block telemarketers and robocalls, not only in the calling but also in the messaging. I'm forever getting calls from what I know I've reported to the blocking app, which I have to manually put in the blocking app. I love the safe search feature, I love the play store features that works you of an unsafe app before you download it. I love so far the identity safe features also.",
            "Perfect Mix of Mobile Security & Antivirus Combo For Galaxy Note 4 Running On Android 6.0.1 Everything seems to run well with no issues. I think I'll stick with this current updated version 4.8.0 on my phone since updating to much further might start to have a negative effects on my old operating system. Keep up the good work.üëà",
            "LOUSY! VPN constantly has to be logged into over & over ... AND the app doesn't recognize login info so you are returned to the login screen. The antivirus can be running at the same time but the VPN is a separate app. Very poor design. Added 10/29/20 - just rec'd notice Norton is removing Call Block feature. RUFKM?? That's one of the MOST important features!! Time to find a BETTER security app. Sorry Norton. Your app is not worth the cost anymore."

I'm going to give it 4 stars once this bug is fixed, but until then it's going to be 2 stars. I love this game, but please fix all the bugs.",

Buildings are way too expensive and im having to use gems to skip missions that I cant do becuase I dont have the right units. It's either a time consuming grind or spending real money.",

Connecting issue even i am connected to a high speed wifi. Every day 3 to 4 missions i have to skip by using 5 emerald because my base is not enough to complete those missions then why it is showing to me. Earning of emerald is too low per day according to its experience. No new events.",
            "I actually like this game but, from 4 star, I made it 2 star. Since you didnt do anything abt this \"CONNECTION ERROR\" problem sht. In this game, \"BUILDINGS ARE EXPENSIVE\". So everytime that connection problem appear, I lost the money i spent for the units. FIX IT THIS TIME. PLEASE... I think every player has the same problem. Atleast return the money back."

When asking for a drive or taxi, it just show a bumpy taxi icon, and after not even 2min it goes back to my research like I haven't made any request. Very very disappointed. This was working perfectly before and noy anymore.",

            "I chose this app because it indicated that the price for my journey wold be between 87 - 110 euros. On arrival at my destination I was presented with a bill for 159 euros. I don't think I would be inclined to recommend this app",

            "This app is a hit and miss. Since there's only one PC at my company I never have time to do my daily reports before I leave. So this app helps in that regard. However, the UI is missing a lot of options/ features that are on the desktop version. So either I have to use my laptop at home to finish all my reports or wait until I get into work that day. Not to mention it's pretty buggy and takes about two attempts to reach it's online servers.",

            "Every update makes this app less user friendly and more tedious to use. ISP Data has now been updated so there is yet another step before being able to document, and schedules as well as most of the features my companies managers need to use for work are still inaccessible on the app. Everything we used to be able to do in one step on the last program we used now takes 3-4 steps.",
            "I've noticed this app is always upgrading and its the unusual times, how can staff complete notes and submitt clockin as well clockout when system is down!!! This results in lost time or unpaid time due to not being able submitt notes on time. On Sept 4 system was down and Sept 5 system would allow staff to leave notes for each goal ,yet the system shows past entries!!! Such a inconvenience, I think agency's should return to the paper form ."

            "One of the best news source bar none. Multiple choices for different areas of interest and special and breaking news and world events. They even have an entertainment and game section. Too much to mention. They provide the facts and they have real, not fake news and an opinion section with seasoned reporters. The video section and news channels will make you glad you took a solid step into the light and out of the darkness of the legacy media. Highest recommendation.",
            "Great app, up-to-date news with excellent research and reporting involved, especially as it concerns China, which had otherwise kicked out or sent money to most major networks. I would have given it less stars, as I don't like the subscription price ($5 a month or no fee and some ads would be better) but I don't read many more than the few 'free articles' advertised as the option for non-subscribers.",
            "My my favorite news source! real news. In a world filled with fake news the Epoch Times stands out. The Epoch Times has held on to the original spirit of the news, sharing the facts with the people. They go after the stories the corrupt mainstream media and turned a blind eye to as it does not fit their agenda. The Epoch Times does not do this. Prepare for a breath of fresh air as you read some real news by real journalists about real events happening in our world. Thank you Epoch Times.",
            "Was a great app! I was really enjoying it till the sneaky upgrade now limits you and now has ads AND forces you to subscribe! $77 special rate and then $192 /yr??? ...for an app??? You lost me. I will be deleting like many others. No thanks!",
            "my very favorite source of news. Easy to scroll down through the stories and click on the one I'm interested in. I love that I can scroll down through a story and find a video click on along with the names I need to go on YouTube for the research. I prefer to listen to the actual people rather than having people tell me what they think that person said and the epoch times has been my best source of obtaining the names behind the story."

One star off. Also while editing effects, why only an undo button? Adding a \"redo\" function in the middle of changing effects would be nice, instead of having to first confirm changes, then click redo on the main screen. 5 stars will come if those are addressed. Thanks",
            "This app is amazing! You have so many optional ways to edit your videos and pitures! You can add pitures and vids together, and even have great background music! And theres options to even add text to your videos, and zoom in and add better lighting! It works perfectly offline. ...its very easy to use the only little issue is that when the videos running, if you add a pic whilst it's running, it will start shaking and juttering. It's just the ticker though, üëç‚ù§ l recommend it!",
            "I don't really write reviews but this was so good I had to write one. It's so easy to use for beginning youtubers and editors unlike most of those apps out there. This is now officially my go to app for editing videos it works offline perfectly, I would definitely reccomend this app to a friend. Edit: One thing that they could fix is how you can't precisely choose where to cut the video , if you click the scissors icon it'll cut where ever the playing thing is and it gets frustrating.",
            "Hi, I have been using your editing app for a little while and I really like it but I have tried 3 or 4 times to edit a video that I made of my cooking show and what happened was I tried to add in 2 or 3 photos before my actual video started to play and I went through and edited the whole video part and then saved it and after it got done saving it I went back and replayed it and toward the end it would freeze and all I could hear was sound. I have tried editing this video several times help!!",
            "Very great app and it is very easy to learn on how to use it. The only thing that bothers me is that when i add a transition effect and play it, when it hits the transition effect it stops but i can still hear the sounds. Please fix this."

For that reason I am considering un-installing, which I did. Now, 7 months later I thought I would give it a try once again. Nothing has been done to improve the situation. Seems like it worse than before. This time it is good-bye forever.",
            "Love this game! Trivia is my favorite. Challenging questions and not much time to answer!! The tiles offered are really cool, as are the rewards when you win. Puzzles are challenging, too. Overall, game keeps my mind sharp! ***OH, one change I really appreciate is during trivia. When you can't answer in time, the game now shows you the answer before closing out. That used to drive me nuts not knowing the right answer for next time. Thanks for updating!***",
            "Fun word game. Coins (which you can buy with real money) get you very little. I wish you could buy hints with them. I paid for ad-free but I still am asked way too often if I want to purchase coins - no, and stop asking, thanks. Recent updates made the daily game clearer. They added a little bee to help out. It's annoying, and covers part of the puzzle.",
            "Falsely advertised as a different game; plus all extra words gained in piggy bank has to be Bought back by me!..for 3.99- you must be kidding; then I have to advertise on other social media to promote this game!?.. for supposed extra coins! I am totally disappointed...where is the original game that was advertised for choosing the correct word that sound the same but have different meanings?",
            "It was advertised on trivia crack as a grammar game. I love grammar and when I saw that advertisement for choosing different words with same sounds and you had to choose which one would be correct in the sentence, I didn't miss a beat to install. Then when I opened it, it was just the basic word cookies, or swipe to get the words. It's falsely advertised. Uninstalled right away. It also was pushing you to spend money so even if you do like this sort of game, I don't reccommend this version."

These are all forms of augmentative and alternative communication, or AAC. \r\n\r\nAAC includes all of the ways we share our ideas and feelings without talking. We all use forms of AAC every day. You use AAC when you use facial expressions or gestures instead of talking. You use AAC when you write a note and pass it to a friend or coworker. We may not realize how often we communicate without talking.  \r\n\r\nPeople with severe speech or language problems may need AAC to help them communicate. Some may use it all of the time. Others may say some words but use AAC for longer sentences or with people they don‚Äôt know well.

Maybe you have seen people using sign language or other gestures. You may have seen someone push buttons on a computer that speaks for them. These are all forms of augmentative and alternative communication, or AAC. <br><br>AAC includes all of the ways we share our ideas and feelings without talking. We all use forms of AAC every day. You use AAC when you use facial expressions or gestures instead of talking. You use AAC when you write a note and pass it to a friend or coworker. We may not realize how often we communicate without talking.  <br><br>People with severe speech or language problems may need AAC to help them communicate. Some may use it all of the time. Others may say some words but use AAC for longer sentences or with people they don‚Äôt know well. AAC can help in school, at work, and when talking with friends and family.  <br><br><br>Our Dialoger App is continuously improved.

            "This game is the best.It has clear graphics which is my favourite and you can drive properly.The reason why I am giving this 4 stars is because there needs to be a map and there need s to be other SUV like ford ranger,Toyota hilux legend 50,amarok,landcruiser and more.there also has to be long trips like which take 2 hours to get there and some music please fix this problem and then I will give it a 5 star out of and I will follow you on Facebook and Twitter and I will send feedbacks.",
            "This is cool game concept. Benifits include no time pressure. Great camera control, never thought I say it, but a little to touchy. Like many other drive sims, I have an issue with aggressive traffic. Some idot drivers are reality, but I hate that all cars on road,will crash into you if your to slow,and act like you can't get out of the way fast enough. Tone this down and you have a great sim w/great graphics. Just plain fun! After all part of the drive & haul world is being slow. Give it a try!",
            "This game looks like it could be really fun. I've played drive simulators before, so I know the controls can be tricky on a phone, but this game is extremely difficult to control. Plus some have a steering wheel and others have left right buttons. Added 1 star for availability via Play Pass.",
            "Very hard to control...You get stuck on everything.. Camera is very bad you can barely control it...If I was you I wouldn't get it...It's just bad...I would give it a zero star if there was one..I don't even no why it has 4. Stars.. everyone gives it a 2 or 1 star...No hate on the creaters on this game tho....I wouldn't get it if I was you..",
            "The game is Too funny but hard also . The graphics are super but one problem is there the other vehicles are doing to bad . They are trashing to our car . Only this this problem is there.and all are good"
