            "We've been trying for a while, but my 2.5 year old is not interested in trying to repeat the words. I'll likely cancel after the first year. Suggestion for the app developers: In the activities where the kids are teaching a new word, you should add a picture of the item in the corner of the screen while the kids say it. Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",
            "Kept seeing ads for this, so I downloaded it! Started the free trial before I decided to buy a subscription, and so glad I did! I couldn't even get a single activity done. There was no sound, the screen kept freezing and the app keeps force closing. Waste of time.",
            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",
            "My 3 year old lost interest quick. Only part she liked was the photo filters."

When I finally realized I was being charged $37 US per month I figured out how to canc it through Google but was told there is a no refund policy. I did not use the app after the trial period and think I should get my money back. Apps make it easy to use but difficult if you are trying to unsubscribe or cancel.",
            "I believe the best feature of this help is the videos of kids are actually kids. They don‚Äôt sound bossy as an adult would seem to a kid with autism. Since they‚Äôre peers to my daughter, she gets encouraged to imitate them and learn from them. We‚Äôve seen the improvement in weeks. She sounds better day by day and the app is obviously beneficial but also fun at the same time enough to keep her focused without feeling like lectured."

        "description": "‚Ä¢ THE FIRST AND ONLY LANGUAGE THERAPY APPLICATION SUPPORTED BY CLINICAL DATA: \r\nIn a 3-year clinical trial of 8,766 children with autism, young children who trained with MITA improved their language score at the end of the trial on average 3-times more than similar children who did not use MITA. See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02708290. \r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises designed to last for 10 years\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Used by over 1,000,000 children with language delay\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Best Autism App on the Healthline‚Äôs list\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Farsi, and Chinese.\r\n\r\nMental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with language delay and autism. MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.\r\n‚Ä¢ Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.\r\n‚Ä¢ Based on Pivotal Response Treatment that targets development of response to multiple cues. \r\n‚Ä¢ Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time\r\n‚Ä¢ Identify colors, patterns and sizes\r\n‚Ä¢ Integrate objects into a unified picture\r\n‚Ä¢ Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front\r\n‚Ä¢ Time prepositions: Before/After\r\n‚Ä¢ Passive verb tense\r\n‚Ä¢ Subject / Object\r\n‚Ä¢ Reading and Writing\r\n‚Ä¢ Numbers and counting\r\n‚Ä¢ Arithmetic\r\n‚Ä¢ Logic and reasoning\r\n‚Ä¢ Mental perspective taking\r\n‚Ä¢ Mental mathematics\r\n‚Ä¢ Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun\r\n‚Ä¢ No Wi-Fi necessary\r\n‚Ä¢ No ads\r\n\r\nMITA develops your child‚Äôs imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child's ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \r\nThe verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\r\nMITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. MITA exercises can be used by children with language delay, ASD, PDD, intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), Down syndrome, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as a supplement to conventional speech therapy.\r\n\r\nMITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J. Elgart and a group of award-winning artists and developers working alongside experienced therapists.\r\n\r\nMITA in the news: https://youtu.be/giZymh3rMHc\r\nMITA research articles: http://imagiration.com/research/",

MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.<br><br><br>MITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES<br><br>‚Ä¢ Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.<br>‚Ä¢ Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.<br>‚Ä¢ Based on Pivotal Response Treatment that targets development of response to multiple cues. <br>‚Ä¢ Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time<br>‚Ä¢ Identify colors, patterns and sizes<br>‚Ä¢ Integrate objects into a unified picture<br>‚Ä¢ Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front<br>‚Ä¢ Time prepositions: Before/After<br>‚Ä¢ Passive verb tense<br>‚Ä¢ Subject / Object<br>‚Ä¢ Reading and Writing<br>‚Ä¢ Numbers and counting<br>‚Ä¢ Arithmetic<br>‚Ä¢ Logic and reasoning<br>‚Ä¢ Mental perspective taking<br>‚Ä¢ Mental mathematics<br>‚Ä¢ Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun<br>‚Ä¢ No Wi-Fi necessary<br>‚Ä¢ No ads<br><br>MITA develops your child‚Äôs imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child&#39;s ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size (screenshot  #1) or color (#2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (#3). Once your child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (#4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. <br>The verbal exercises offer a more conventional approach to language acquisition, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.<br>MITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities of each child. MITA exercises can be used by children with language delay, ASD, PDD, intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), Down syndrome, and other neurodevelopmental disorders as a supplement to conventional speech therapy.<br><br>MITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J. Elgart and a group of award-winning artists and developers working alongside experienced therapists.<br><br>MITA in the news: https://youtu.be/giZymh3rMHc<br>MITA research articles: http://imagiration.com/research/",

            "Very good game! Thus, for language it is important 1. To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered. I have to change a level back manually at each session, because I am sure that my child does not remember a name of an object, but got the program algoryth using visual clues.",

Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",

When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",

            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

They've never gotten the proper visual feedback from me when sounds were said in error; they just got my very green attempt at audio feedback/direction (I'm a CFü•¥). I love the option to do a 3D visual and the animation. I'm just in awe and so glad to finally feel like I will be making a dent in my kids' goals with the help of this app. Thank you.",

            "It's a great app. with core vocabulary! You can form sentences, edit/customize pages and pictures, add pages and pictures, and it's super easy to navigate! Anddd it's free!! I highly recommend this app!!",
            "I'm too old to figure this out.... Need something that lets me use the keyboard to type and then read that out loud. Maybe have a library of phrase I've input.... Communication outside of my computer is too tedious no matter what.",
            "This app has been a life-saver; we use it to support our communications with our child on the autistic spectrum. The app in itself has to be personalized, and it is NOT easy.. It is time-consuming to get the personalized images (although they have an extensive generic image bank) up, as well as the pronunciation you wish on specific names or words. And, it is nearly impossible to transfer a profile between android devices. Yes, the app could be better, and it is a shame there is no more technical support offered for it, but I am giving it five stars because it is free, and it has been a massive help to us. Thanks!",
            "I found this yesterday and have been playing around with it-I have 18 years experience working for children who have execptionalities. This is a wonderful app for anybody who may need a voice at times but do not have professional supports in place yet. My son has found it easy to navigate and loves that I was able to personalize the labels. The only issue I've had so far pertains to rearranging the pictures, they didn't stay where I put them.",
            "Trying numerous augmented communication apps for my daughter and this one was the closest to what she use to have on the ipad when the device died. Awesome app. Very easy to set up, a lot of setting options to customize for the needs of the individual and it does not matter how long she pushes the button, it will say the word. Speech can be a little odd but this app gives you the ability to use other voice apps to change the sound. After trying quite a few, this is the one which fit all my needs. Will be donating money to the developer as soon as I can. Great job and thank you so very much!"

            "Problems for people with dimentia or Alzheimers... It is NOT appropriate to ask them how well they are remembering things, understanding things, etc.as this app does with the user. Do not do that! It's embarrasing and very upsetting to people with those conditions to be asked those questions. If someone is using it with them, that person can answer those questions for them if it can be done without their hearing or seeing the questions. It is a good idea for someoneto do the exercises with them.",
            "Went thru the baseline activities. Then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. Since I had no info on what subscription would entitle me to, plus no idea how much it would cost, I chose subscribe. But the page wouldn't load. Waited about 3 mins then X'd out of the app. I believe the app could help me, but I'm most likely out of the game because I'm on a very tight fixed income (disability).",
            "great idea. not edited properly. I have went through multiple questions and there are multiple correct answers, however if you do not guess the CT APP correct answer your answer is deamed wrong. Even simple ones where you have to identify the symbols. There were 5 symbols, but it only lets you mark 4 of them. Good idea, poor follow through. Or you have to say the name of the picture, the picture is of a persons legs at a beach. If you say beach it us wrong because they are looking for LEG.",
            "I have been looking for an app like this for a few years. Paid $2000 out of pocket to get all my strengths and weakness after multiple TBI's. After you register, you find out, you can only use it for15 days, then have to get a note from a doctor to use it, and pay them. I don' t mind paying for an app to help me. Getting a doctor note, when you are on a fixed income, w/o insurance is what I object to. If I ready needed a doctor I get a nice cash only based rate, but this is not neccessary.",
            "Was excited to find something to improve my cognitive abilities, then I read the \"about game\" and found the app is free for 15 days, then you have to pay $25 a month, or $250 a year, or $350 for 2 years!!! I have been out of work since having a stroke (4 months). I can't afford $25 a month when I'm struggling to pay my electric bill, have already terminated the TV, phone is next to cut. App is free only for therapists and those working in the medical field. DON'T INSTALL. WASTE OF TIME."

And such a notable pause where it misses words. Correcting the dictated speech is an issue as well. I would like to dictate and edit at the same time if possible.",

What went from a seemingly useful app is now just a complete pain to use everytime. Why? What else did they skip? Went from first week 4 stars to now i just want it off my phone."

We will then walk you through how to systematically practice K in the comfort of your own home. We provide all the materials you will need and game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say K correctly in the word \"cave\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices K by saying \"kick\" while playing soccer, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say K\r\n~Tips on how to teach K to your child\r\n~A video showing exactly how to say K and explaining common errors\r\n~A variety of cues for helping your child say K correctly\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word and sentence level\r\n~Online K flashcards\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial plus practice ideas. You can expect to do a bit of learning and then carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! \r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying K\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on K for a long time!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services for K even though they have trouble saying the sound!\r\n~Speech language pathologist who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist. She understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference.

To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

He can be helped by characters/syllables using voice.<br><br>-Exercises: this is based on multiple words exercises such as find the word, complete the idiom, find the intruder and some categorization games.<br><br>-Mirror: this is about praxis. It is a set of exercises of face&#39;s movement to help recover from paralysis. The patient has a camera component to mirror the moves.<br><br>-Voice: in this module there are texts and songs to practice the diction. Both can be recorded such as measuring progresses weeks over weeks. There is also a function to keep track of the difficult words to pronounce. Translations help recover a foreign language. Finally, the patient can measure his diction speed.<br><br>-Diction: speaking to the device the system helps recover the right pronunciation. It can be simple words or phrases through idioms.<br><br>-Memory: it consists of several memory games/exercises such as images sequencing, Kipling game (object memory), words memory, path/visual memory, couples, mixed shapes and numbers sequencing.<br><br>-Mathematics: it includes several games/exercises such as calculation, writing numbers in letter and re-ordering a list of numbers.<br><br>-Score: it shows global results and percentage, and detailed results by exercise over the week, month and year.<br><br>-Options: finally this module allows to set the language (English and French for now), the levels, the voice level and also submit problems and feedback.<br><br>Each module consists of swiping Tabs.

AST can also be used by older children and adults who have speech sound problems. The app uses pictures that are attractive to children to help them improve their speech sound production and in turn forms an easy home tool to supplement therapy implemented in the clinic which might minimize the duration of therapy and number of visits to the speech clinic. AST includes all the standard speech sounds in Arabic and 84 short syllables (i.e., consonant+ vowel) and includes 252 picture-word stimuli form everyday life. At the beginning of therapy, the speech therapist chooses the target sounds to train the client on in therapy at the clinic. Then, the clinician explains the use of the app to the parents and or client depending on the age of the client to help provide more training opportunities on the target sounds outside the speech clinic. This app can augment what a client is trained on at the clinic which might help accelerate gains in speech therapy. A user can choose the sound to train on by pressing the icon of the sound on the screen and then choosing the desired syllable and then choosing the words that contain the sound. We hope you find the AST app helpful and fun to use.",

            "This a great app developed by an amazing speech therapist!! Her methods have worked wonders for my twins and this app is a great supplement for at home/on the go practice. Not to mention the kids get really excited to \"do their words\" now! My only concern with the app is that test results don't transfer from separate devices for Android users. If there was some sort of log in and out feature for the app, I believe the entries could be saved on any device the app is used on. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
            "What a rip off, the 'phrases' and 'sentences' are literally the same for each word in the set of sounds. For example, if you do B sentences it will be 'Bob will beg for a big banana', and then 'Bob will beg for a big ball'. Saying the exact same sentence with one word difference is ridiculous. Don't buy.",
            "I signed up for the free trial and couldn't hear any sound. I then subscribed for a paid version even though I still had the free subscription, and still no sound coming out from the app. I sent a mail to you yesterday about this and I haven't gotten a response. It's getting really frustrating!!!!",
            "The One-minute Articulation app is an all in one speech app. It introduces vocabulary, allows the student to practice and test fluency of words and word phrases. As a parent it gives you a clear understanding of where your student is verbally and how to help your student communicate.",
            "A very fast, simple and easy yet effective way to train children to say and practice their sounds correctly. My kid loves to see her results and all the sounds she has done! This is a fabulous way to teach speech to children!"

        "comments": [
            "This app may turn out very usefull in the near future. But it requires a lot of bug fixes. Like for example, when I import a scanned documents and the code converts it from text to speech, there generally are changes I want to make in the text I imported. Hence, when I change the text the app is still reading out the unedited text. That needs to be fixed. But overall, this app is great but needs a lot of changes and improvements. Looking forward for a better version of this soon.",
            "Ooooh my gosh, this needs a lot of work but it's already being promoted mindlessly in YouTube. Import does not support common eBook formats. You cannot select any TTS you download from other sources. Interface is too barebones. The only interesting feature is the automatic reading speed increase, but that is a paid feature. 50 bucks per year? Doesn't worth it for me guys, YET. I'm sticking with the app called @Voice. Great potential. Oh and I forgot that the notification bar is useless.",
            "I know it's in Beta, if they do fix the bugs I will change my review, so the app does not work perfectly, the voices are the same as you get from other places, I sometimes use Google Assistant which just does sound better, the camera does not load, importing links sometimes works and sometimes does not, and I noticed that I used my Google Assistant to do a certain task, and they Speechify continued out of no where to resume it's playing. I really want this app to work, I hope you fix the bugs!! Would recommend for now checking out the Chrome Extension, that works just fine!",
            "This app is useful, but it still has some stuff to fix. I decided to sign up for the free trial, and the premium voices did not load for me. Tried reinstalling the app, but that didn't work. Besides, it does not seem to be able to import Pocket lists, even though it's offered as a feature. This app sounds very promising, hope you can get it to work 100%. It's good but can be better.",
            "Unfortunately, the android version does not have the same features as the ios counterpart. For instance, I cannot listen to all items of a list with a single keypress. I need to open all of them individually, which makes the app essentially worthless for hands-free usage."

        "comments": [
            "My ability to speak has been deteriorating lately to the point where I often have severe difficulty getting out things I want to say, and this app is extremely promising when I have those episodes! The ability to save phrases especially- that seems exactly like the kind of thing that would be a premium feature, except it isn't! How cool is that?",
            "I already left one review and I am still currently still using this app to communicate with others due to the fact that I am on a ventilator and cannot speak. There are two improvements that would make this perfect: #1 Being able to use it to speak on phone calls would be fantastic because currently having to text my response while the other person speaks and waits for my response via text #2 Being able to label your saved phrases would really be great. Side note: Thank you for the prayers.",
            "Its a wonderful app for making (text to mp3) l liked very much because its very easy to use but has two problem the first small font size for phrases and the second slowness of mp3 and when you save a file by same name for mp3 it delete the old one. if it save the mp3 voices automatically by number 1,2,3,4 ...etc and ability to enlarge my favorites phrases font size it will deserve 5 star (text style enable you to type in big font but save phrase in small size thanks developer for this great app",
            "The overall app is good but there are things which need to be fixed like the realistic voices in each language are very few because others feel like robotic so add more and also when i write a number with a decimal like(32.8) it doesn't pronounce the decimal point it just skips and reads the next letter.Otherwise the app itself is good.Thanks.",
            "This app is very good, but we cannot edit the title of created categories. Also, when we hear spoken text, it sounds very good, but quality of saved audio files is very bad. If there were not these two problems, I would have given five star to your app."

As√≠ el terapeuta tiene un apoyo de im√°genes de todos los fonemas adem√°s de juegos que hacen el trabajo m√°s atractivo para los ni√±os.\r\n\r\nLa aplicaci√≥n ha sido elaborada con la colaboraci√≥n de la logopeda Beatriz Ibarra Benedicto .\r\n\r\nLogopedia 1 : ejercicios de articulaci√≥n    \r\n‚Äì Contiene: 13 sonidos ( B,BL,BR,CL,CR,D,F,FL,FR,G,GL,GR,CH )\r\n‚Äì 478 palabras, 478 oraciones\r\n‚Äì El precio de todos los sonidos es de 4,99 EUR.\r\n\r\nLogopedia 2 : ejercicios de articulaci√≥n\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pmqsoftware.logopedia.es2 \r\n‚Äì Contiene: 7 sonidos ( J, K, L, LL, M, N,  P)\r\n‚Äì 483 palabras, 572 oraciones\r\n‚Äì El precio de todos los sonidos es de 4,99 EUR.\r\n\r\nLogopedia 3 : ejercicios de articulaci√≥n\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pmqsoftware.logopedia.es3 \r\n‚Äì Contiene: 9 sonidos ( PL,PR,R, RR, S, T, TR,DR,Z)\r\n‚Äì 429 palabras, 640 oraciones\r\n‚Äì El precio de todos los sonidos es de 4,99 EUR.\r\n\r\nEstos ejercicios no reemplazan las sesiones de logopedia.

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

I have a child with exceptionalities as well and she is able to navigate, understand and learn the concepts. I love how the content is tailored to the age of the child. My son is able to learn more advance subjects by changing the age. The best part is that there are ABSOLUTELY NO ADS and it is free!!! I highly recommend this to all parents.",
            "I am absolutely in LOVE with this app! It has the best learning material and no ads. Perfect!! I was looking for something educational for my 7 and 4 year old, and this is the only one I will ever use for them. It's perfect. Seriously deleting all other learning apps and games because this is the only one they will ever need. I can't believe it's completely free and no ads. Thank you so much for making this amazing app free for my children and helping them learn. I am so greatful!!!",
            "My little niece loves it! Everything is VERY clear, easy to understand, fun and really helps keep their attn while learning! NO ADS and NEVER boring!! Can't believe this is a FREE APP!!! KAK doesn't give kids the answers, they have to actually figure things out (and learn), which is wonderful! The fun (sometimes silly) songs and educational stories are great!! There's constant positive reinforcement, throughout. If they get an answer wrong, they're encouraged to keep trying. EXCELLENT APP üëå!!",
            "We love this app! It's one of my son's favorite things to do on his new tablet. He calls it his \"learning\". I do wish you could track progress through the regular Khan Academy (as he has an account there), and there's definitely a need for more to do offline. We like to use this in the car or while we are out for very long periods of time, but he is getting bored with the small bits he can do offline. Otherwise, this is a really great app, overall.",
            "Picky 4 and 6 year old enjoyed the challenges. Most of the time, I have to remind them to try the apps but not this one‚Äîthey voluntarily uses it. The user interface of the app of a thumbs up too. It's easier for parents to find a subject and see which topics from their list hasn't been opened yet because it shows a check sign once you're done with a certain topic."

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I absolutely love this app. It is beyond any other \"so called\" educational app. This is so intuitive and really engages my kids. I have a child with exceptionalities as well and she is able to navigate, understand and learn the concepts. I love how the content is tailored to the age of the child. My son is able to learn more advance subjects by changing the age. The best part is that there are ABSOLUTELY NO ADS and it is free!!! I highly recommend this to all parents.",
            "I am absolutely in LOVE with this app! It has the best learning material and no ads. Perfect!! I was looking for something educational for my 7 and 4 year old, and this is the only one I will ever use for them. It's perfect. Seriously deleting all other learning apps and games because this is the only one they will ever need. I can't believe it's completely free and no ads. Thank you so much for making this amazing app free for my children and helping them learn. I am so greatful!!!",
            "My little niece loves it! Everything is VERY clear, easy to understand, fun and really helps keep their attn while learning! NO ADS and NEVER boring!! Can't believe this is a FREE APP!!! KAK doesn't give kids the answers, they have to actually figure things out (and learn), which is wonderful! The fun (sometimes silly) songs and educational stories are great!! There's constant positive reinforcement, throughout. If they get an answer wrong, they're encouraged to keep trying. EXCELLENT APP üëå!!",
            "We love this app! It's one of my son's favorite things to do on his new tablet. He calls it his \"learning\". I do wish you could track progress through the regular Khan Academy (as he has an account there), and there's definitely a need for more to do offline. We like to use this in the car or while we are out for very long periods of time, but he is getting bored with the small bits he can do offline. Otherwise, this is a really great app, overall.",
            "Picky 4 and 6 year old enjoyed the challenges. Most of the time, I have to remind them to try the apps but not this one‚Äîthey voluntarily uses it. The user interface of the app of a thumbs up too. It's easier for parents to find a subject and see which topics from their list hasn't been opened yet because it shows a check sign once you're done with a certain topic."

            "So far I really like the app and am considering purchasing the pro version. My English is already on the Native level so I struggle with \"finishing touches\". The one improvement that I would make is when there's practice after a lesson, it highlights in yellow sounds that weren't great but the app doesn't tell me what exactly I'm doing wrong. This would be huge help!",
            "I dont like the fact that the display language of the app is your selected native language and there is no option to change to English. I live abroad for long time and use English on my phone, strangely enough im not comfortable with the app using my native language. The default language of the app should be the phone OS language or at lease give the user the option to select the prefer language they want. @Thanks for the quick support. I managed to change to English in the app, hence I upgrade the rating. But I would still suggest that the default language of the app should follow the OS default language.",
            "Amazing app! The only issue for me do far is that I'm not interested in the listening lessons as it's quite easy for me, and I don't see a way to skip listening lessons and concentrate only on the pronunciation",
            "It would be great if we could have had the app for British accent. Brilliant app but unfortunately not for me. I will appreciate it and willingly be a premium user if you could offer it. Thank you.",

            "Terrible. This app doesn't compare to the website I used to use some years ago. It used to be excellent, and it explained many aspects such as voice, manner and place of articulation. It explained all the consonants and vowels. I don't like its new layout. It's not useful. Now it is just a few examples. Can you explain me what happened with the original one?",
            "This app is a great tool for learning English and for learning the International Phonetic Alphabet.  I came here after enjoying the Sounds of Speech website for years.  I'd love to see some color added to the app. It seems silly, but the website had great aesthetics, and this one looks like they skimped on design. Adding a little color would help visually distinguish the categories from subcategories of phonemes.",
            "Very bad, you can't compare it with the one in the website. I can't understand why they deleted it.",
            "very nice and easy to learn.",
            "Just installed.. Crashed twice trying to exit. It's a large app, please provide ability to move to ExtSD Card. Internal storage is a valuable commodity these days, and this app is hardly a daily driver for me as an English teacher. Would be nice to include listings/links of all the YouTube videos used, so I can just tap/select sounds I wish to target. Where's the \"search dictionary\" function shown in your screenshots?"

            "Very simplified and fun way of learning. Though it's designed for kids, it removed the fear of learning a new language from me. My kids are already learning. We hope to be able to communicate with the hearing impaired.",
            "The app itself is great but there needs to be a lot more content like numbers, potty words, wait, sick, hurt as well as snake would be a good one here in Australia. I would happily pay for each update as i have reached desperation point with my highly intelligent three year old who can not speak apart from using the same five sounds for everything and he's been going postal with frustration. I don't even care it's not my countries sign language because in two minutes my son was telling me baby and car then i realised todays upset is he left his doll we use to help communicate in the car. He is also trying to copy the audio and responds so well to the kids who demo and they are easier to follow than any adult ones. Please add more words I will pay.",
            "dont pay for the extra signs. I thought this app was going to help us learn sign but you can't really do much with the minimal amount of signing you pay for. it isn't really very user friendly either. nothing is categorized by type. to open a sign you must click on the word then push play and then to get back to the sign list you have to push another button making it monotonous. wish there was a refund option",
            "Awesome! Waiting for more sign! The kids are so cute! I had a problem where the sign disappeared and emailed the creator. You simply have to uninstall and install the app again in the app store.",
            "I hear fine but I have short term memory loss. this helps so much when it comes to remembering. wouldnt change a thing. hope more signs become avalable. this I would spend money on."

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: F is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say F and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice F with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo I created this not so fancy app to help reach this goal! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say F correctly in the word \"frog\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices F by saying \"fork\" while eating, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say F\r\n~Tips on how to teach F to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online F flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying F\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on F for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying F!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: T is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say T and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice T with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say T correctly in the word \"taco\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices T by saying \"teeth\" while brushing teeth, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say T\r\n~Guide on how to teach T to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online T flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach T to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying T\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on T for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying T!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference.

It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach T to your child!<br><br><b>Who should use this app:</b><br>~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying T<br>~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover<br>~Children who have been working on T for a long time and haven&#39;t quite mastered it!<br>~Children who don&#39;t qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying T!<br>~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips<br><br><b>Who made this app:</b><br>This app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don&#39;t always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.<br><br><b>Enjoy!</b><br><br>This app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: B is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say B and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice B with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. So, I created a not so shiny app that will actually help your child. In order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say B correctly in the word \"border\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices B while playing and saying \"ball,\" carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say B\r\n~Tips on how to teach B to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online B flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying B\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on B for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying B!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

In the face of a language barrier, showing the child's parents a comparison of the two recordings makes it easier to explain a diagnosis.

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: J is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say J and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice J with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say J correctly in the word \"Jeep\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices J by saying \"juice\" during meals, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say J\r\n~Guide on how to teach J to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online J flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach J to your child.\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying J\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on J for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying J!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

When he/she doesn't say it correctly, it can be frustrating! To ease this frustration and provide parents with all the tools they need, we created Speech Therapy: N. Speech Therapy: N is a comprehensive app designed by an ASHA certified, practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say N and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice N with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say N correctly in the word \"north\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices N by saying \"nighty night\" while playing house, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say N\r\n~Tips on how to teach N to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online N flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying N\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on N for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying N!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: P is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say P and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice P with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say P correctly in the word \"pony\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices P by saying \"pants\" while getting dressed, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say P\r\n~Tips on how to teach P to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online P flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying P\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on P for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying P!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: D is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say D and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice D with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nThis app will help reach this goal! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say D correctly in the word \"donkey\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices D by saying \"draw\" while coloring, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say D\r\n~Guide on how to teach D to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online D flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach D to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying D\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on D for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying D!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

This is on a Pixel 4XL, I can't even imagine how slow it must be on a less capable device. 2) sometimes the frequency plot fails to draw when I start recording. Data is recorded because if I stop recording the plots appear. But the canvas is blank during recording, weird.",

            "- Gives a different min/max/average pitch when loading the same audio clip - 10+ second load times per clip - Can't export clips without first opening them, exporting takes an extra 10+ seconds - Pressing back while loading causes the app to softlock, preventing UI inputs - Can't access saved data via file browser, you have to use the built in share feature - Using the above gave me a clip that read as an hour long yet only contained 1min of voice (for what was a 30 second clip)",
            "The real time frequency thing in the bottom right doesn't work. Works on the free version though. Edit: Yeah, no, it's basically just every aspect of this app is totally broken. Stick with the free version DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!",
            "Decent app .. gives great objective feedback. One suggestion .. hard to work out how to input target values. Suggest you change the colour of the 2 characters where you can change the value, to yellow, leave rest of screen white. Otherwise great app."

We can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: CH is a comprehensive app that describes how to say CH and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice CH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say CH correctly in the word \"chipmunk\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices CH by saying \"cheeseburger\" while eating dinner, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say CH\r\n~Tips on how to teach CH to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online CH flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning and reading at first. Then, you just have to carve out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying CH\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on CH for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying CH!\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing, speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

The United Kingdom one sounds so cool but coma at least of the people wanted to go back to The Way It Used To Be. Or nice, and none corrupted. This is a warning if you don't fix it I'm not going to cause any more easily. This app is no longer supporting five stars. And it's so bad now that the voice is sounding so weird call Mum this is my favour",
            "The British voice I've been using has become corrupted. I uninstalled and then reinstalled the Google TTS app, but the voice is still corrupted. It is the only one that I like. I tried to get an API key from the Google cloud in order to use the new WaveNet voices, but it is so complicated, I gave up. I look forward to when you will have a separate app for the WaveNet voices. I don't mind paying. But I don't want to go through a thousand hoops to get them from your cloud.",
            "I love the app, but I wish there were even more English, United States voices for BrailleNote Touch Acapela, and it would be cool to hear the voices sound more natural, expressive, and have more inflection. It would also be cool if the voices sounded like they were \"breatheing\" (when it's the end of a sentences.",
            "I've been using text to speak for years and it's gotten to the point where no matter how clear I speak, it will make up words that do not exist in replacement of the word that I said. For example, if I say the word \"field\" your system will spell it \"feeld\" which is not even a word. Or if I say nightmare, it will spell out \"knight mare\". Actually had the correct two mistakes speaking giving this review which is as ironic as It gets. And that's just one problem. There are so many more. Please fix",
            "I've been using the standard English (UK) female voice, and it's worked well untill today; where suddenly, the voice changed. And it started taking huge pauses after every sentence, regardless of which speed the voice is at. Which is EXTREMELY annoying. I can still use the old version by UNINSTALLING ad relying on the standard bloatware which comes pre-installed on my Samsung device, BUT the blistering thing keeps reinstalling itself every night! Thanks for fixing something not broken. :)"

Some words are hard for it to pickup but the app has a way to store frequently used or hard to understand words on the app for easy access. I needed to transcribe and print old letters from the Vietnam war without hassles and this app, for only $.99, was well worth it. Highly recommend.",

            "This is one of the best apps I have tried and have kept because it understands me clearly what I say and gives me options to make sure its correct.. Only down side and I hope it gets fixed is the short period you have to quickly start speaking so isn't that great if you have to think what your saying.. apart from this an amazing app.",
            "So far so good, but i would like a feature that gives me controls so set the text to a different colour to indicate a different speaker. I would suggest a small control panel with different buttons that can be set with a name. This is perfect for group meetings that is great fro reference ans even better for interviews.",

            "Absolutely love Speechkeys, a somebody that avoids physically typing as much as I can, this is an absolute lifesaver, the one small criticism I do however have is that the microphone appears to stay active for a few seconds after you click the mic button, it's no big deal but it does get a little bit annoying after a while. It would also be nice if the keyboard could be a little bit bigger for those times you do have to physically type, apart from that, it's great.",
            "It could be completely perfect. But there is a problem for bilingual users: Everytime you change your language, you have to scroll down two thousand languages to find yours. And this happens every time you change the language, which happens too often for bilingual users.",
            "At last someone has developed a dictation software app exactly what is required by allowing you to readily insert punctuation as you dictate without interrupting the smooth flow of dictation itself. I have searched high and low for so long to find something like this swipe The developers great job well done. The interface is simple, the functionality is comprehensive and the dictation quality so far is as good as anything else I have used.",
            "Dictation seems to work well and unlike Google dictation which easily switches back and forth between languages, Speech keys voice typing stays with the language it is set to, which I find very helpful if you have an accent. However and this has found very annoying, on my phone, every time I try to edit a custom key, the app crashes. I hope the developer finds out why and fixes it soon.",
            "Speechkeys is definitely the best software available to turn your phone into a dictation device. The recognition is outstanding and includes many additional features that make voice dictation with your Android device a smooth, effective and pleasurable experience. I strongly recommend Speechkeys for anyone who needs voice type dictation or would otherwise like to enhance their ability to enter text on their Android device. This voice dictation software is outstanding!"

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "The lessons are brilliant and have helped me tremendously with my japanese. This alone for me warrants a 5 star rating. However, the app itself has many issues of its own. For example it often freezes or lags, taking 5 to 10 seconds to pause or rewind after pressing the buttons. I have had less issues from the website on pc, but it is more convenient on mobile. Overall it is a great tool for language learning but comes with minor technical issues.",
            "The app for this overly expensive programme is horrible. It constantly crashes, especially when you are using it while moving, so you can't use it at the gym or while walking without getting very annoyed! Also goes to sleep when your phone does. Don't have any of these problems with my other audio apps on my phone, so it's an issue with Pimsleur. I have reported the problems to Pimsleur but no improvement. A shame - the actual programme does help to learn languages. Fix the app!",
            "I really liked this app.It's better than other apps out there in many ways. First the friendly user interface,it's so easy to use, there are many languages to learn,and the audio helps even more to those beginners everything is so well managed ,but everything has it's bad side here it's just been a moment I tried this and I noticed those kanji words were also mixed up and it makes it hard for beginners but I know a bit of Japanese so it's not a big deal for me but it is for others,great app tho!",
            "Very good! I took Chinese. Its good if you just want to learn conversational Chinese which is what I wanted. I didnt want to read or write. Learning conversational Chinese is very effective with Pimsleur. The only downside was there were no notes. Sometimes I didnt know if I heard the speaker correctly. Only after using google translate did I realize I didnt hear it correctly and mispronounced words. Id give them 5 starts if they add downloadable notes to their course.",
            "Very good language learning tool. However the app is a little glitchy. It keeps forgetting I completed certain lessons so it will keep trying to send me back to a previous lessons I already did. Pretty annoying. I also wish I could acquire a transcript of each lesson somehow that way I could see exactly what phrases I was having trouble with instead of searching through all these different sections. Overall solid though."

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "Great app, works as described after one week. I would like to SELECT MY ALARM SOUND, but as long as it works. I've been using \"Reminder\" app, with an alarm that can't be stopped, made me crazy. This alarm is short and does the trick. Ads are small at bottom and not intrusive. Nice job developers! When an app works well, is free w/ ads at bottom, I try to patronize ads if interested. Least I can do for an honest developer.",
            "The alarm part is very usefull...other apps won't really remind you with alarm and you can really miss your appointmens. I actually tried one of those for a month and it did not help to remember. Two days would go by without remembering my to do list. With this app, it can be a pain when the reminder goes on and on, but we won't miss any appointments! Thank you!",
            "Very useful app. Works well. I just had to figure out how to not get a bunch of advance notices, because to me no advance notice should be the default. But you have to go into the advance notice settings and specify you don't want any. Otherwise you get notices all day long. Overall an app I can recommend.",
            "It isn't working properly, for some reason. It doesn't let me know when I need to take my meds.. no sound.. nothing. It worked great in the beginning, but it just stopped. I have a Huawei P30 Lite. Now I have to look for another reminder app, unless someone can help me..",
            "Great little reminder app. I have to have a particular reminder go off 10x a day and this app let's me customize it how I like, including the ring tone and the ability to snooze the reminder with several options. It also has a silent driving mode, which is good for safety reasons!"

            "Very helpful for me, since I am legally deaf. Sometimes I have trouble understanding someone that talk very fast and low, and in loud environment for example like Walmart paying for my items and the cashier had some questions and I had a hard time understanding her, thankfully this app came in very handy. I also have a speech impairment due to my deafness, and sometimes others have trouble understanding me, again this app made my day. Thanks a million, Michael",
            "I'm deaf/ hard of hearing. I came upon this app. Read where it can detect knocking at the door. I can't hear people knock, so I decided to down load the app. Unless there is absolutely no noice and someone pounds on the door. The phone doesn't tell me when someone knocks. Back to my flashing light doorbell. I would need an app the can distinguish between sounds at any volume, including music, human speech, or tv and between someone talking to me and just near me having a conversation.",
            "I am just learning to use this app. So far, so good. Am trying to discern just how accurate are the transcriptions under different circumstances: indoor and out, telephone, TV dialog, children's voices and other, including effects of ambient noise. As of now, results of my \"tests\" are encouraging.",
            "I'm profoundly deaf and hoped I might be able to use this to alert me to sounds at home instead of relying on old fashioned equipment. It doesn't seem to pick up anything except really loud sounds and that's with the phone held close to the source. It doesn't detect door knocking or the phone ringing or the microwave beeping or any of the things it's supposed to. The transcribing feature works - though it doesn't seem to do well with Scottish accents - so I don't think there's a problem with my microphone. I wonder if it might be an issue with sensitivity but there isn't any option to configure the microphone, which is maybe something the developers need to add? Disappointed as I've seen a similar feature on a friend's Iphone and it seemed to work perfectly. Time to give up on Android devices when it comes to accessibility I think.",
            "I gave it 4 stars coz' there are times that there are missing words & I would like to suggest for you to have an editing mode, All caps, upper or lower case, and to have a key word as a command or a button maybe? Take this words as an example: PLUS SIGN plus sign (as a word) + (as a sign) yeah, I hope you get my point somehow cause I swear you're going to bring this app on another level if you can. Love lots and Take care to all of us during this pandemicü§ç God Blessü§ç"

        "description": "Talk To Me 100¬Æ Lite (free version) is a powerful, engaging tool for children who are learning to talk, or who have difficulty mastering verbal expression. An interactive teaching device, Talk To Me 100¬Æ allows the child - by pressing buttons - to see words, hear words, understand their meaning and experience the joy of communication. Using the pinch and swipe gestures, the board can be expanded and moved on the tablet as needed. This Free Version offers 9 of the most frequently used symbols and sounds. The full version is priced at $5.99 and offers 100 symbols and corresponding sounds.\r\n\r\nThe Talk To Me 100¬Æ Android App was developed by a Speech and Language Pathologist as a way to facilitate error-less communication (in which the learner never fails, but is supported in all communication attempts) to teach beginning language skills.\r\n\r\nThis new voice output app helps parents, teachers and therapists jump-start verbal expression for children who are struggling to communicate.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ allows the learner to control their environment, and to signal the point of readiness to communicate. Talk To Me 100¬Æ also provides immediate and consistent feedback, allows for practice and repetition of 100 frequently used words throughout daily activities, provides fun and enjoyment and lets the learner become accustomed to touch screen use.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ is designed to provide communication partners with 100 words organized in a predictable format to use in an unlimited choice of daily activities. Sydspeak created this app for children with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, speech and language disorders and other special needs. Talk To Me 100¬Æ provides communication partners with a core vocabulary to begin verbal expression for all functions of language: imitate, comment, answer, question, describe, retell, accept, reject, repeat, command, request, explain, persuade, maintain social relationship and influence.\r\n\r\nThe adult communication partner models one or more words by selecting the buttons and using their natural voice to speak the same words whether you are getting ready for school, eating dinner, reading or playing outside; opportunities for verbal interaction are unlimited.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ provides a beginning augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) solution for people who have difficulty speaking. Once the learner begins to combine 2-3 words spontaneously to communicate a new or novel thought, they are well on their way to using more than 100 words, either using natural voice or using a more expanded and dynamic AAC device.\r\n\r\nThis Android app is a digital replica and companion to the original ‚Äúchild friendly‚Äù Talk To Me 100¬Æ available at www.sydspeak.com. Priced at $59, this tablet is similar in size and comes in a durable plastic case with 3AAA batteries. Research shows that when each communication partner uses their own personal voice output device, language acquisition is more efficient. For some children, a predictable pattern of images on a computer screen using the same child‚Äôs voice has more impact than pictures on paper with changing adult verbal interactions. For the first time, we now have a powerful communication system where both partners can have their own affordable and effective language device with the same voice and symbols.\r\n\r\nThe free version offers a sample of beginning language learning.\r\n\r\nI recently evaluated a 3 year old child who was nonverbal. His parents said he only spoke 2 words: ‚Äúmama‚Äù and ‚Äúbye‚Äù. When presented with the Talk To Me 100¬Æ, he began exploring the board, pressing the symbols and listening to the words. I began using my version on the tablet, and he immediately began imitating my words by pressing the symbols on his device. What sometimes takes months of therapy to achieve, he was imitating words within a few minutes!!!",

        "description": "Speech Therapy: Z\r\nIs your child working on saying Z correctly? If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: Z is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say Z and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice Z with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say Z correctly in the word \"zigzag\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices Z by saying \"zip\" every time a child zips a coat, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say Z\r\n~Guide on how to teach Z to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online Z flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app. You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach Z to your child!\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying Z\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on Z for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying Z\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program. If you have concerns about your child, we recommend a consultation by a speech language pathologist before beginning any home program.",

Speech Therapy: M is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing speech language pathologist. It describes how to say M and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice M with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need.

For example, a child may say M correctly in the word \"mask\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices M by saying \"more\" while playing blocks, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say M\r\n~Tips on how to teach M to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online M flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app!

You will learn how to systematically practice SH with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home.

For example, a child may say SH correctly in the word \"chef\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices SH by saying \"shut\" every time he/she closes a door, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind.

            "Good apps with lots of \"premium voice\" and great looking ui. But the cons is: 1. They don't support web reading unlike @Voice. 2. If you using pdf better use moon reader, they have simplified mode and night mode also they bookmark your pdf or book folder (no sign up) and of course they can use text to speech as well. 3. They don't have search feature or favourite for the voice so good luck searching it. The pros probably 1. They can use cloud, 2. They can use ocr (paid). 3. Lots of voice (paid)",
            "Love the app. It's really good for slow readers like me. Can you guys please add folders for adding custom books you own so you can read them? I also love the CC feature as well. I have bad reading comprehension and a intellectual learning disability so I have a hard time learning. It's really hard trying to find a app like this. It's a good app if anyone has a learning disability who struggles. If I take a picture of a Japanese light novel book in English that I bought will ORC pick it up?",
            "I bought NR several years ago. Its been the best program i found up until last year. It got very glitchy. Today i had a problem with it playing my document at all even after i restarted the app. I uninstalled and reinstalled only to find out the entire app was updated and now is a monthly subscription. Im not where i can afford that atm and Im a sad that I didnt realise it before i uninstalled. I prefer one time pymnts. The new version says there is a free version but it wont work on my phone.",
            "This app has potential however it cannot read hyphenated words such as self-employed instead it reads \"self minus employed.\" As I have lots of readings with hyphenated words this becomes problematic.",

If 'yes,' we can help!\r\n\r\nHow This App Works:\r\nSpeech Therapy: V is a comprehensive app designed by a practicing, ASHA certified speech language pathologist. This app describes how to say V and then how to teach it to your child. You will learn how to systematically practice V with your child using research proven techniques in the comfort of your own home. All the needed materials are provided as well as game ideas for every level of practice. There is also a bonus section of photo flashcards that you can bring up on your device for a quick practice.\r\n\r\nThis app is VERY different than any other app on the market made for speech therapy practice at home. \r\n\r\nI was tired of children with articulation needs NOT making progress! I took a good, long look at the materials available for parents. While shiny cards and fancy apps look fun, they are NOT what children need. Articulation practice should be natural, happen throughout the day, and occur with common words that your child frequently says. \r\n\r\nSo, I created this not so fancy app to help parents reach their goals! \r\n\r\nIn order for your child to make progress with articulation goals, he/she needs to be able to say the desired sounds within words and then practice that skill in a functional setting such as at home using words he/she actually says! For example, a child may say V correctly in the word \"valley\" while playing a game; however, he/she most likely won't say that word again for weeks or months. Not really functional.....\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a child practices V by saying \"five\" when doing math, carryover of progress is likely to happen!\r\n\r\nThis articulation app is created with this philosophy in mind. It will take a bit more work for parents, but it will pay off in the end!\r\n\r\nWhat's Included:\r\n~Explanation on how to say V\r\n~Guide on how to teach V to your child\r\n~Cues that speech therapists commonly use\r\n~Word lists\r\n~Picture Flashcards\r\n~Practice ideas at the word, sentence, and conversational level\r\n~Functional games that don't require flashcards\r\n~Online V flashcards in all word positions\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect:\r\nThis app is a tutorial which includes explanations, teaching materials, functional games, and flashcards all wrapped up into one app! You can expect to do a bit of learning at first, and then, carving out a few minutes each day to practice with your child. It only takes a few minutes, seriously! It is basically a crash course on how to be a speech therapist in order to teach V to your child.\r\n\r\nWho should use this app:\r\n~Motivated parents whose children are having difficulty saying V\r\n~Children who are already in speech therapy and need to work on carryover\r\n~Children who have been working on V for a long time and haven't quite mastered it!\r\n~Children who don't qualify for speech services even though they have trouble saying V\r\n~Speech language pathologists who want word lists, teaching techniques, and flashcards at their fingertips\r\n\r\nWho made this app:\r\nThis app was created by a practicing speech language pathologist who understands how much practice is needed for articulation (speech) therapy and knows how parents really have all the power to make the biggest difference. However, parents don't always have access to everything they need. Speech therapy can also be expensive and this is frustrating for everyone!! To reach more families, she made this app for a VERY affordable price so everyone can get learning today.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nThis app is a supplemental, home program.

The scheduled review is extremely helpful in retaining what you learned in long-term memory. I'm very happy with this Korean speaking teaching app and paid for the unlimited subscription. It was money well spent.",
            "I like it, seems really nice. But seems kinda slow in will just randomly freeze and not respond when trying to move on. Nice concept but performance needs improvement. The design of the app isn't that great either. I do like being able to add a picture of someone so I can pretend to practice korean with them and make the dialogues more meaningful, that is if the app would work correctly. The only way to message the developer in the app doesn't feel like it works either.",

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

            "Google Voice no longer works with the latest, official messaging app. Google is forcing us to use the Carrier Number, now. So, this app is no longer properly integrated with the Google ecosystem as it exists in 2020. It's so disappointing that I have to port my decade-old number BACK to the carrier just to use the latest default messaging app. What a mess, so frustrating, but I guess not the worst thing to happen in 2020 :/",
            "I love Google Voice! When COVID-19 closed the schools I was able to keep in touch with my students and their parents without giving away my personal mobile number. I can call and send/receive texts on my phone and my computer. The best part is that I can copy text messages in their entirety and paste them directly into my Parent Contact Log. Indispensable!",
            "Ive been with Gmail and Voice since they were in beta and invitation only. All they've done is improve over time. Always great call quality and its allowed me to always have the same number without caring about delays around porting my number when I've changed my carrier. Its the only number I give out. I never get spam or fraudulent calls. I suppose it's because of all that Google AI special sauce. Keep up the good work!",
            "Works great on my primary mobile device, but will not receive calls on my spare phone. This appears to be a product defect, which limits GV's portability. Looking forward to a fix, which would earn it a full 5-Star rating from me. Update: Developer contacted me and it appears that I missed a key step. My bad. GV now rings through to both my primary, and spare phone. Upgrading to 4 stars. My secondary phone, LG Rebel 4, will vibrate only.",

They are leaving a message and I can here them and they can hear me and we both can hear the voice-mail recording but can't stop it. And 3 times I have been in the middle of a conversation with someone and it switches to a completely random person that I didn't call...and the person i did call can still hear our conversation (me and the new person) but we cant hear them.

Between purchasing the appropriate headphones and then paying for the individual music packs, it is a pricey investment. Also, the time commitment is substantial. But, we have had great results. It has helped significantly with our son's engagement, auditory attention/processing, and language. One negative is I cannot get it to acknowledge purchased music on a second device.",

I understand the music is altered. Experimenting further, I believe the problem is only when playing tracks on Bluetooth speaker (we don't use the Modulated music products which I know are only designed to use with headphones, but Quickshift tracks recommended by therapist). Is it not okay to listen this way?",

            "It's basically a funny intro into machine learning/programming for anyone interested in computers, electronics, math or engineering, especially students 10-17 y/o. The difficulty level of the \"puzzles\" is on the easy side, U.I. is well done. Don't expect a game in the classical sense, so there scientific references for further reading on the topics to deepen the simple crash course this game is.",
            "I've been playing lots of programming games lately (human resource machine, Zachtronics stuff) - and this game has history and knowledge of ML, but it's a sorting game. That's it. Sort, sort, sort, credits. There's other aspects that just aren't fun: * \"evolve\" parts just take up time and could just be sped up and or skipped. * Startup stages just immediately fail after the 4th startup, and you just lose money. No real lesson to why I failed, AND I have less money now. * 3x speed is still slow.",
            "I love this game so much from the theming to the puzzling gameplay. It's explained simply but never actually holds your hand. Great game for people with spare time and brain cells.",
            "I really loved this game on PC. But on mobile the interface is a little lacking. It is hard sometimes to copy and paste nodes. And I can't find a way to copy and paste things.",
            "If I had one complaint it would be that can't run this game in portrait mode, which isn't even a big deal. Otherwise, it is absolutely perfect."

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

        "description": " This is Boo!\r\nBoo helps children practice speech sounds that they need to improve. He is designed to entice spontaneous repetition of individual speech sounds and simple syllables. At the same time, he enforces helpful phonological awareness, by showing what actions happen in the mouth during articulation. \r\n\r\nThe app is developed by a certified Speech-Language Pathologist. The children can use the app all by themselves or together with an adult. When the child simultaneously uses multiple senses (vision and hearing) to imitate and repeat it becomes easier to overcome obstacles and improve its articulation skills.\r\n\r\nWho is Boo for?\r\nThe app is developed for children aged approximately 3 to 6 years old being in, or need to be in contact with a speech-language pathologist or therapist due to speech difficulties. It provides a motivating way to:\r\n‚Ä¢ practice one or more single speech sounds;\r\n‚Ä¢ practice voiced versus voiceless consonants;\r\n‚Ä¢ practice joining speech sounds together to create simple words.\r\n‚Ä¢ practice the link between letters and speech sounds in early reading practice\r\n\r\nBoo may be a stepping stone to a better pronunciation!\r\n\r\nBoo can also be a helpful pronouncing learning tool for those - young or old - who are currently learning the English language.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do?\r\nSounds in the paid app version are consonants P B T D K G S Z SH CH F V M N L W, essential to speech development. There are also five monophthong vowels, depending on what English dialect (American or British) you have chosen in the settings.\r\n\r\nIn the app, you put one or two sound cards in corresponding fields, building a sound or a simple two-letter syllable. Then, Boo articulates the sound or syllable, clearly showing mouth and tongue movements during articulation. He also shows which sounds are voiced by showing vocal folds vibration. This may be enticing for the child to imitate and recognize how the sound syllables are made by tongue and lips. \r\n\r\nYou can record and playback your own sound production for comparison (user's permission is required, see note below). You can also make Boo go slow, repeat, or articulate sound noiselessly (muted). Behind a parental lock you can disable or enable sounds as well as read instructions and tips from the SLT.\r\n\r\nThere is also a minigame in which you can practice identifying different speech sounds as Boo articulates them, either with sound or muted using only visual cues.\r\n\r\nThe images themselves on the sound cards, not necessarily the image's first letter, represent the actual speech sound that Boo makes. For example, the hi-hat represents the sound t because it sounds like a t.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNOTE: There is a free, lite try-before-you-buy version with a few speech sounds and limited functionality. If you are uncertain if this version is useful, try the lite version first. If the child then interacts and spontaneously imitates Boo, then it could be worthwhile to purchase the paid version.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBoo Articulation Helper is developed by a speech and language therapist & pathologist with therapeutic experience with children with developmental verbal dyspraxia or articulation/phonological impairments. The app is tested by eight children in their homes, aged 3-6 years, seeing a SLP on a regular basis. The try-outs have shown an improvement of training motivation and spontaneous repetition of speech sounds in a way that proved more difficult with other training material and methods (undocumented).\r\n\r\nThe app is developed to be used on a tablet as it is easier to handle with small children's fingers - although it also compatible with smaller screens.\r\n\r\nPlease rate the app! That helps others to determine a purchase!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNOTE: You need to grant the app permission to use the microphone if you want to use the app's voice recording feature.

I've reported each one and they have seemed to fix them in a timely manner but can't give 5 stars since there have been so many errors.",

The more you use a phrase, the higher up it appears in the prediction list, meaning that frequently used phrases require fewer key strokes.\r\n\r\nIt has an intuitive, simple interface, but there are also some menu options and settings for things like auto clearing the text field, auto-starting at boot, Text-To-Speech (TTS) settings, changing the font size, removing a phrase from the database and so on.\r\n\r\nIt works best with a hardware keyboard (I used a Logitech Keys-To-Go) but a software keyboard should also work well. Hardware keyboards may be easier for someone with motor difficulties as there tends to be less 'dragging' across the keyboard, which can be a problem with touch screen keyboards.\r\n\r\nI hope someone else finds it useful.\r\n\r\nAlthough they were not involved in the production of this app, please consider donating to The Motor Neurone Disease Association, registered UK charity number 294354.",

The more you use a phrase, the higher up it appears in the prediction list, meaning that frequently used phrases require fewer key strokes.<br><br>It has an intuitive, simple interface, but there are also some menu options and settings for things like auto clearing the text field, auto-starting at boot, Text-To-Speech (TTS) settings, changing the font size, removing a phrase from the database and so on.<br><br>It works best with a hardware keyboard (I used a Logitech Keys-To-Go) but a software keyboard should also work well. Hardware keyboards may be easier for someone with motor difficulties as there tends to be less &#39;dragging&#39; across the keyboard, which can be a problem with touch screen keyboards.<br><br>I hope someone else finds it useful.<br><br>Although they were not involved in the production of this app, please consider donating to The Motor Neurone Disease Association, registered UK charity number 294354.",

And i have purchased the full version. When i tried to download the same in my mobile but i do not get the full version and ads keep popping up which is kind of very annoying. I am logged in bluestacks and my mobile with the same name. So i dont see why there should be any problem. Please rectify the problem.",

Being respectful is incredibly important in some cultures and this app can leave you sounding like a rude foreigner. No good. And in some cases it only teaches you the polite version. Which is usually fine, but so inconsistent. It would be really useful to have a basic travel phrasebook app like this. So I hope they improve it.",

            "I have witnessed spirits communicating through spirit boxes, esp in actual haunted places. So it is possible. It's just that the words are usually short, to the point, using the nearest matching audio to answer. But unfortunately they're limited to the audio language. It's not a very clear and accurate science. And not all spirit boxes work as effectively. It's also a myth that communication must be recorded. Eg. That's just another option. It is also possible to hear spirits without any aids.",
            "I really like this idea you came up with. This is not a spoof app for those out there like me that are having a real hard time finding something legit. One thing people do need to remember is that it could take a lot of time to make contact. Encounters usually don't happen instantly, or on command. I've been a para investigator since 2001, and a lot of times I wont get any evidence. Thanks for something new to try out!",
            "As soon as I started a session I just heard weird glitchy sounds. It was super creepy and I really didn't enjoy it. I have no idea what it was trying to say because it was talking very fast and the words just sounded glitchy and strange. I am really creeped out now :D",
            "I do think its real I have had fake apps before and its usualy just somthing like \"imm hereee \" but as i know some paranormal ivestagators(sorry I cant spell) i was planning on going on a trip with them so i got this app and went , i told them about it and they said it was fake but after hearing it they said it was amazing , i would recomend to serious takers and people who want to just want to try ( my friends' youtube channel us spirit finders UK)",
            "This game is so creepy it's like staticy and like some ghost talking I don't want to play this game no more don't play this game whatever you do or something bad will happen to you I don't know if that would happen to you because it's never happened to me before but if you play this game maybe you're in bad luck so don't play this game"

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Angrr can help you control and effectively resolve any problems that arise from issues related to anger. The app was conceptualized and created by a psychiatrist and is meant to be a complete solution to help you control anger. The app is organised into several sections which can help you understand and deal with anger issues.\r\n\r\nThe app contains the following sections.\r\n\r\n1)The anger test - Taking this short test will help you identify your anger problems.\r\n\r\n2)The second section would involve a short peek into the physical symptoms of anger.\r\n\r\n3)Anger and its root causes are discussed with several helpful examples. This will help you relate to several issues. You may either read these sections or listen to them being read out aloud.\r\n\r\n4)The section on forgiveness explains why one needs to forgive and also provides a simple tool to involve your friends/loved ones in helping you get past issues.\r\n\r\n5)We introduce the PEAce method to deal with anger. PEAce stands for pause, evaluate and act.\r\n\r\n6)The pause section consists of 4 different exercises that can help you calm down. \r\n\r\na) Fidget - You will have to tap an image till your mind returns to calm.\r\nb)Move- You may walk, run, jump or shake till the counter gets to 0.\r\nc)Breathe - A breathing assistant with a voice prompt and a visual cue.\r\nd)Calm - A guided mindfulness exercise to help you control anger.\r\n\r\n7)The evaluate and act section includes the anger journal. The anger journal will help resolve the thoughts that are leading to anger. This section will also serve as an anger diary which you can review anytime.\r\n\r\nOnce you are done with the sections that help you understand anger, you may use the \"Angry Now\" button to quickly get you to the useful sections.\r\n\r\nIf the voices in the app sound robotic, please make sure that you have text to speech configured in your phones TTS settings.\r\n\r\nWe hope this app helps you out.",

Oh...please don't use the \"dialect\" excuse for lack of male voices. AND TOO EXPENSIVE!!!",

After some playing around Google voice isn't filtering anymore (tested in Google assistant), but this app still asteriks' everything. Don't know why, because if I type it out, it doesn't filter it. So I think it still is a problem with the voice input, but I can't seem to fix it :-\\ Else this app would get 5 stars. It really is quite neat.",
            "Very nice. I even tried to see if it is accurate on my language, but it is actually good. There are a little problems on the past tense that i find rather odd, and some words that i don't understand or mising. But overall, this is surprisingly accurate. I highly recommend that people try this app. No joke, legit good.",

There are a few issues with the English words used in the UX, but overall does exactly what I need, and does it very well. They choose to err on the side of caution, and announce the time more often then needed at times, but that is better than missing one. Giving the highest possible rating.",
            "I used to have a speaking clock on an older Nokia phone (Symbian), and so I compare what I had there with what I get here: There, the app was under a soft key. When I woke up during the night, I just clicked the key, and I was told the time. Here on Android, it is quite different: There is no soft key, you have to start the app for it to work. But the screen doesn't remain on all night long (and it wouldn't be good because of the light emission), so when I wake up I would have to activate the phone, move the homescreen to where the app is, then touch it to know the time. But I just wanted to know the time, not make sure I was really getting wake...",
            "Tells me the time every hour, which is what I wanted. Thank you for that. However, even though configured to not speak when in silent or vibrate mode, it just did which woke my kid up. Would like a swedish audio language setting as well, or just a custom text field somehow.",
            "This is one of my most favorite apps ever! Sadly I am switching from an Android phone to an iPhone and there is nothing even close to the same thing available for iOS. I am totally bummed out. This app works so well for announcing the time every 5 min, which is incredibly helpful for keeping me on task and focused. I am going to keep my old Android smartphone on my desk just to be able to keep using this app because I depend on this app so much. THANK YOU FOR THIS APP!",
            "Excellent app. All's well once I figured I had to untick sleep mode in the apps settings to tally with my Moto sleep settings to keep it quiet at night So for me at least, inbuilt scheduler not required. Lots of great features in this app, many thanks."

I like to save an image of the page to OneNote and then copy the transcribed text next to it. Would be great if I could setup a macro to do both in one go.",

Right now according to the website Wikipedia there are a total of 14 different disorders ranging from eye twitching to restless legs. Some of these problems are treatable and even preventable when monitored by a doctor or specialized health professional. Sleeping disorders can be extremely dangerous when they go undiagnosed. Many people who are suffering from this disorder are facing a lot of life threatening problems because having a sleeping disorder can disrupt you from living your normal everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis can overtake someone if they're spending more time worrying about their condition than getting the correct amount of sleep. The problem with many people who are dealing with a sleeping disorder is that they're not aware of it being a problem until they see it's affecting their job and everyday life. Those who suffer from this can also develop clinical depression because they feel like they're not able to do any of the things they're used to doing if they've been diagnosed with a sleep disorder.\r\n\r\nIndividuals are given a test called the Polysomnogram which is used to determine and diagnose sleep disorders so specialists and doctors can plan a treatment designed for that individual person since not all treatments are the same. According to Wikipedia they list the common treatment options for sleeping disorders are: behavioral/psychotherapeutic, medications (Rozerem, Ambien, Ambien CR and Lunesta are common prescribed sleeping pills given for those diagnosed with a sleeping disorder), and other somatic treatments that are given. Sometimes people who have disorders such as narcolepsy usually have their brain activity measured to see where they are reaching peak points of sleeping so they can be treated since narcoleptics can't really work on jobs that require them to operate machinery or other things because they have to be alert and awake to know what they're doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this audiobook you read about these topics:\r\n‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ\r\n01 - A Sleep Disorder That Affects the Legs - Restless Sleep Syndrome\r\n\r\n02 - An Alternative Approach for Overcoming a Sleep Disorder\r\n\r\n03 - Children With the Sleep Disorder of Sleepwalking\r\n\r\n04 - Fatal Familial Insomnia\r\n\r\n05 - How to Tell If You Have a Sleep Disorder\r\n\r\n06 - Hypersomnia (oversleeping)\r\n\r\n07 - Illnesses That Can Cause a Sleep Disorder\r\n\r\n08 - Insomnia - The Most Prevalent Form of Sleep Disorder\r\n\r\n09 - Insomnia in popular culture\r\n\r\n10 - Insomnia\r\n\r\nand much more!\r\n\r\n\r\nContact us! ‚ô°\r\n‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ\r\nFor latest updates, please like us on Facebook\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Twayesh.Projects\r\n\r\nAnd also follow us on Twitter\r\nhttps://twitter.com/TwayeshProjects\r\n\r\nOr you could just email us at our E-mail\r\ninfo@twayesh.com\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\n‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ\r\nThis audiobook is in English. \r\nThis audiobook require android tts - text to speech.\r\n\r\nThe text-to-speech (TTS) technology may not be available in some devices.

        "descriptionHTML": "Sleeping Disorders: The History <br>‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ<br>When we hear about sleeping disorders we&#39;re commonly hearing about those who sleepwalk and can&#39;t sleep which is known as insomnia, but often we wonder why sleeping disorders are becoming a prominent issue in today&#39;s society. Right now according to the website Wikipedia there are a total of 14 different disorders ranging from eye twitching to restless legs. Some of these problems are treatable and even preventable when monitored by a doctor or specialized health professional. Sleeping disorders can be extremely dangerous when they go undiagnosed. Many people who are suffering from this disorder are facing a lot of life threatening problems because having a sleeping disorder can disrupt you from living your normal everyday life.<br><br>This can overtake someone if they&#39;re spending more time worrying about their condition than getting the correct amount of sleep. The problem with many people who are dealing with a sleeping disorder is that they&#39;re not aware of it being a problem until they see it&#39;s affecting their job and everyday life. Those who suffer from this can also develop clinical depression because they feel like they&#39;re not able to do any of the things they&#39;re used to doing if they&#39;ve been diagnosed with a sleep disorder.<br><br>Individuals are given a test called the Polysomnogram which is used to determine and diagnose sleep disorders so specialists and doctors can plan a treatment designed for that individual person since not all treatments are the same. According to Wikipedia they list the common treatment options for sleeping disorders are: behavioral/psychotherapeutic, medications (Rozerem, Ambien, Ambien CR and Lunesta are common prescribed sleeping pills given for those diagnosed with a sleeping disorder), and other somatic treatments that are given. Sometimes people who have disorders such as narcolepsy usually have their brain activity measured to see where they are reaching peak points of sleeping so they can be treated since narcoleptics can&#39;t really work on jobs that require them to operate machinery or other things because they have to be alert and awake to know what they&#39;re doing.<br><br><br>In this audiobook you read about these topics:<br>‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ<br>01 - A Sleep Disorder That Affects the Legs - Restless Sleep Syndrome<br><br>02 - An Alternative Approach for Overcoming a Sleep Disorder<br><br>03 - Children With the Sleep Disorder of Sleepwalking<br><br>04 - Fatal Familial Insomnia<br><br>05 - How to Tell If You Have a Sleep Disorder<br><br>06 - Hypersomnia (oversleeping)<br><br>07 - Illnesses That Can Cause a Sleep Disorder<br><br>08 - Insomnia - The Most Prevalent Form of Sleep Disorder<br><br>09 - Insomnia in popular culture<br><br>10 - Insomnia<br><br>and much more!<br><br><br>Contact us! ‚ô°<br>‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ<br>For latest updates, please like us on Facebook<br>https://www.facebook.com/Twayesh.Projects<br><br>And also follow us on Twitter<br>https://twitter.com/TwayeshProjects<br><br>Or you could just email us at our E-mail<br>info@twayesh.com<br><br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br>‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ<br>This audiobook is in English. <br>This audiobook require android tts - text to speech.<br><br>The text-to-speech (TTS) technology may not be available in some devices.

I downloaded over a dozen apps before I found this one. Nothing compared. The developer is amazing and so helpful via email.

            "I love the sleep tracker feature on this! I upgraded just to accurately record my sleep and it has improved over time. One feature I wish it could do in the tracker is combine different sleep sessions in same day. For example, I like to take a 30min nap during lunch break. Sometimes at night, I am woken up to take dog out, or use the facilities. When I stop and restart it, it only records the most recent session.",
            "Doesn't always record analysis. Some mornings you turn the alarm off (the alarm that is part of this app) and it simply does nothing instead of displaying your sleep record. It seems random as to when it works. In particular when you turn the alarm off and it goes to snooze (another glitch) it fails to record.",
            "I benefited from this app a few years ago and need to do this again. Why did it switch from accelerometer to microphone? How will it know if I've stopped breathing or just changed sides? The accelerometer was way cool.",
            "The microphone tracking is a great idea and seems well implemented, but there are two issues that baffle me that are easily fixed: 1) I often wake up early and want to know if I've gotten enough sleep. Show me. Why make me remember what time I went to bed and calculate? 2) It knows when I'm awake or asleep based on the microphone data so why doesn't it subtract out the time I was not sleeping? \"In bed\" time should be a second, less-important metric. Time actually asleep is more important.",
            "It works. Its got a well designed UX. It really helps people with disorders such as ADHD where following a regular routine is important, but regular alarms are too discordant. I like the fact that the upgrade screen is at the beginning. The design is Honest. So all in all, well done."

Poor update needs corrected asap.",

            "Good mix of context based learning. Seems to introduce new words at a good pace, I+1 style, where it builds on what you've previously learned. It also looks nice, which matters! Seems to be northern dialect based on the pronunciation of gi and the n·∫∑ng tones. Good for me since I'm learning northern dialect!",
            "My experience is VERY good. I personaly had a problem where i was charged yearly instead of monthly. But the team answer was so prompt my problem was solved quickly. I recommend it for the example sentences with vocabulary. The only downside is not having a word list of all voca learned. But they said they are working on ir and there are other features meanwhile. Personally i had to write it down manually but it was do-able. Seriously, fast answering was the best. 5 starts.",
            "I have been locked out of the premium features and can not renew my premium subscription because it is saying i have alreay paid for these features, which I have paid for, i have been a member for at least 3 months. I have reinstalled, logged out and even cancelled and renewed my sub which was a complete waste of time and $13 as nothing helps. I obviously enjoy your app but this is incredibly frustrating",
            "The speaking practice seems really good, but it was constantly telling me to speak slower and occasionally connect to the internet when I'm on a stable wifi connection.",
            "It's a great app, the listening portion seems to be spot on according to my Vietnamese friend I tried it with. My friend did point out that the pictures for the speaking part don't really Match the vocabulary very well. One example is the sentence was about the boy drinking coffee, and it's just a picture of the a coffee cup. I have tried a few apps to practice Vietnamese, and so far I am really impressed with this one."

            "I've been using this app for 2 years and almost unlocking all the trees. It was very helpful. After the new updates, it lost me as a user. Since I don't have \"pro version\" all the tress I had unlocked were refund and I lost all of them. The only ones I have are the free version trees. I am very upset and disappointed in changes. Not longer does this app care for their users, they only care about profits.",
            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

Jonathan Tilley is a professional speaker and voice-over artist from the US with the experience and know-how to help you. In the course of 11 exercises he will unfold the mystery behind successful, clear and confident speech and unleash your presentation potential. The exercises were developed and conceived together with the author, Jonathan Agar, also an experienced voice-over artist and actor. \r\n\r\nThis app is the new and improved way to a better command of the spoken word. The exercises address posture, vocal technique, breathing, articulation, consonants, vowels and presentation. \r\n\r\nThe basis version of the app includes an introduction, warm-up activities and 10 other exercises from the different categories. There are around 20 minutes of audio material to help you complete the exercises correctly and exactly. Try it out and you will learn the tricks of the trade used by professionals at the top of their game. \r\n\r\nWhen you buy in-app supplements you will gain access to almost 2.5 hours of further audio material. Do you need to work on basic breathing techniques or perhaps on your posture? Then all you have to do is buy the corresponding chapters to get the optimum mixture for you and your needs. If you like a challenge, then why not try some of our tongue twisters in the articulation sections? Of course there is the option of taking the whole bundle so you don‚Äôt miss out on any of the essential information. \r\n\r\nAlongside the written and spoken contents there are comprehensive video sections and you can even record your own voice and play it back to make sure you are on the right track. This extraordinary device offers so much more than a book or a cd which are often in a much higher price range. \r\n\r\nMaybe you are interested in improving your vocal capabilities, or perhaps you have to speak in front of an audience every week? What if you just want to tackle a problem with pronunciation, or maybe you work as a professional speaker and you feel the need freshen up your technique? This is the right app for you. You will be surprised at how much fun speaking can be. \r\n\r\nAt this point I would like to pitch in a special thanks to our actors Sandrine Mittelst√§dt and Dominic Boeer for the great photos that accompany the exercises. \r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\n+ Introduction \r\n+ Warm-up \r\n+ 10 Exercises from the varying categories \r\n\r\nShop: \r\n+ 9 further packages, each containing 11 exercises available to buy in-app \r\nOR \r\n+ Package bundle for the remaining 9 packages available to buy in-app \r\n\r\n+++ A total of nearly 2.5 hours of audio material to guide and optimize your experience",

            "Pretty enjoyable, better than checking Bulbapedia multiple times for sure. Being able to check locations, sprites, moveset, type matchups, BST from all of the 890+ pok√©mon with no problems at all, is really satisfying. Interface is pretty solid, and even thinking that having to pay for the premium to use dark mode (who I'm a huge fan of), is still not a big of a deal, and for sure won't make me dislike this app at all. Probably my favorite Pok√©dex app I have ever seen. Keep up the good work! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®",
            "I love this app, and all of the team builders that I can save. Its great for my mind that won't shut up. My only issue is that for the team builder, I can't select regional forms of pokemon for my team (i.e. Galarian Ponyta). I can evolve some (i.e. Pikachu) to it's regional form, but not the ones that don't have a split evolution. Aside from that, its a wonderfully made app with frequent updates!",
            "This is amazing!! I can look at the locations and for the upper gens 5-8, I can actually check the area, like for Sword and Shield, not only does it tell me where the pokemon appears in, but I can see the conditions such as \"It only appears when it's raining\". If I have one problem though, it has to be the cries of the gen 8 pokemon. They sound very low quality and in some cases, it sounds a bit like your device's speaker is broken. Crown Tundra is here, aling with the locations!",
            "This app literally has everything you could possibly want in a pokedex app. It has a full pokedex/itemdex for information and location, and team building with in depth analysis of weaknesses and coverage. There is nothing left out! I dont see how any other app can compete with what dataDex offers. Not to mention they update the app often so they are always giving the most new and accurate information! 5/5 EZ",
            "Very nice app, and it could be great! Would love to see the ability to search through all available swsh pokemon, and not have them broken up by galar/isle of armor/crown tundra. It's super nice that I can sort the dex by a stat, but i wish i could sort every pokemon. Also, there are some issues with the move dex. I don't think that the \"Pokemon who learn this move\" works right. I'd also love to be able to sort by moves available in swsh. Not just moves introduced in swsh, and no removed ones."

Introduce you to Real English that is essential to every day English conversations \r\n2. Have you say variations of each phrase so many times you say it without thinking \r\n3.

Not click on damn adds while attempting to navigate something that makes itself impossible to understand or get to learn because of an add ever 5 secs. Deleteting! immediately",

            "After reading a few of the reviews, I was nervous about trying to update. Happy to say I had absolutely NO problem. I used to have problems with many updates until I realized that my VPN was working too well, lol. (Even with \"safe\" sites. Nord can suck and I'm sorry I paid for 3 years in advance to get a good deal, or I'd have dumped it ages ago!) I never know what update is going to be stopped until it is, so if you're having trouble and have a VPN, try pausing it then try again.",
            "I'm always a little hesitant about updating this update after reading the reviews each time. It seems this update always seems to be tied to an update with Chrome. I have not had any issues with updating to this latest version. It is concerning, when there seems to be no feedback from the development team, who put out these updates. I hope someone is making them aware, of all the difficulties people are running into. Someone on their end should always monitor, after an update is available.",
            "It's awful and won't update, and because of, google chrome won't update!!! Fix it!!!!... C'mon!!! Stop giving us updates that don't work!! And because of it, google chrome will also not update!!! Said before, FIX IT!! or stop doing updates!! And yes, I've tried possible fixes that others have stated, still no! Herd we are again, one week later and this app won't update thus chrome won't update!! Fix ur crappy software or better stop the updates since they don't work anyway!",
            "nearly every weboage opened using this. When scrolling down, freezes and \"shakes\" on Android 11/ pixel 3xl Would love to delete it. But I've got years of saved content in it. Which for some reason known only to the Google gods. Does not save in the full version of chrome. Why? If I save a site in webview, aka bookmark it. Why doesn't it save in chrome too. Doing so would eliminate more of the infamous Google duplicity. We could eliminate this app or chrome. Which are technically the same",
            "I can't even download the most recent update, despite trying for several days. Reading the other recent reviews, I see that maybe it's good I've got an old version. Not good, cause it's still been buggy as hell, but, better (maybe)? What's going on? I use Android so this is affecting my other apps badly."

        "description": "Talk To Me 100¬Æ Android and iPad app was developed by a speech and language pathologist as a way to use error-less communication (in which the learner never fails, but is supported in all communication attempts) to teach beginning language skills. This new voice output device helps parents, teachers and therapists  jump-start verbal expression for children who are struggling to communicate.\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ allows the learner to control their environment, and to signal the point of readiness to communicate.  Talk To Me 100¬Æ also provides immediate and consistent feedback, allows for practice and repetition of 100 frequently used words throughout daily activities, provides fun and enjoyment and lets the learner become accustomed to touch screen use.\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ is designed to provide communication partners with 100 words organized in a predictable format to use in an unlimited choice of daily activities. Sydspeak created this app for children with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, speech and language disorders and other special needs. Talk To Me 100¬Æ provides communication partners with a core vocabulary to begin verbal expression for all functions of language: imitate, comment, answer, question, describe, retell, accept, reject, repeat, command, request, explain, persuade, maintain social relationship and influence.\r\nThe adult communication partner models one or more words by selecting the buttons and using their natural voice to speak the same words  whether you are getting ready for school, eating dinner, reading or playing outside;  opportunities for verbal interaction are unlimited.\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ provides a beginning augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) solution for people who have difficulty speaking. Once the learner begins to combine 2-3 words spontaneously to communicate a new or novel  thought, they are well on their way to using more than 100 words, either using natural voice or using a more expanded and dynamic AAC device. \r\nThis app is a digital replica and companion to the original ‚Äúchild friendly‚Äù Talk To Me 100¬Æ available at www.sydspeak.com.  Priced at $59, this tablet is similar in size and comes in a durable plastic case with 3AAA  batteries. Research shows that when each communication partner uses their own personal  voice output device, language acquisition is more efficient.  For some children, a predictable pattern of images on a computer screen using the same child‚Äôs voice has more impact than pictures on paper with changing adult verbal  interactions.   For the first time, we now have a powerful communication system where both partners can have their own affordable and effective language device with the same voice and symbols. The free version offers a sample of beginning language learning.\r\nI recently evaluated a 3 year old child who was nonverbal. His parents said he only spoke 2 words: ‚Äúmama‚Äù and ‚Äúbye‚Äù. When presented with the Talk To Me 100¬Æ, he began exploring the board, pressing the symbols and listening to the words. I began using my version on the android app, and he immediately began imitating my words by pressing the symbols on his device. What sometimes takes months of therapy to achieve, he was imitating words within a few minutes!!!",
