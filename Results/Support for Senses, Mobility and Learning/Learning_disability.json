When I got it back, I sent messages asking for a refund the same day the payment processed. But no response. We have reduced income due to covid and this left $8.00 in my checking account. My kid no longer uses it and I want a refund.",
            "It's great app for special child..but it's much costy to compare to other apps.if a possible prodive some more discount for monthly payment.....",
            "This program is absolutely amazing. I swear they have to be hypnotizing or drugging my little guy the way he calms down excitedly when its otsimo time..ü§î Im gonna need to get a lifetime license",
            "I really wanted this to work! Unfortunately, on my Lenovo Chromebook it does not. It looks like an awesome app though and has won awards. UPDATE: Thanks Otsimo for your response! Usually there is a message on my chromebook that tells me an app is not compatible. it is not fair to give a 1 star rating for an app that is not available for chromebooks so I am changing to a 4 star for great customer response. If you label your app as not available for chromebooks I will raise it even higher.",
            "You are cheating people out of their money. I was within the trial period when I cancelled my subscription from the app. And to my surprise money still got deducted from my account.And when I wrote email to your support team they said I need to get in touch with google pay and in most cases they won't refund the money. I really don't care if google pay did it or something else... I cancelled my subscription from your app within the trail period. So return my money. People beware don't fall prey."

            "Very good game! Thus, for language it is important 1. To decrease delays between trials - they wre very long and a child loses attention, while in language teavhing procedure speed is a vital clue. 2. It is important before changing the \"level\" to verify that a word is really remembered. I have to change a level back manually at each session, because I am sure that my child does not remember a name of an object, but got the program algoryth using visual clues.",

        "description": "This app is a must-try for parents, teachers, and tutors who teach reading to students of any age. It is also excellent for self-study to improve reading and English pronunciation.\r\n\r\nUltimate Phonics is useful in any situation where reading is taught:\r\n\r\n* Beginning Readers\r\n\r\nDid you know that many children never become good readers? Reading is the most important skill for education and success. If you have young children first learning to read, you can give them the gift that lasts a lifetime by teaching them with Ultimate Phonics. Just an hour per week can make a huge improvement in their reading ability.\r\n\r\n* Struggling Readers\r\n\r\nDo you have children or students who guess and skip when they read? Did you know that word guessing causes poor reading comprehension and terrible spelling? Relying on word guessing prevents students from becoming good readers and cripples their education.\r\n\r\nA good reader reads by rapidly and accurately sounding out new words. That is exactly what Ultimate Phonics teaches. It develops your students into more accurate, fluent readers with good reading comprehension.\r\n\r\n* Dyslexia and Orton-Gillingham\r\n\r\nUltimate Phonics is very effective for teaching dyslexics to read. The app can be used either by itself or as a supplement for Orton-Gillingham programs or other programs designed to overcome dyslexia.\r\n\r\nIf you are an Orton-Gillingham teacher, you will love this app. It has excellent word lists and decodable sentences, all broken down and sounded out. The app also has a Find feature that lets you look up lessons matching any phonogram in a matter of seconds. This app is a great supplement to any Orton-Gillingham program and is guaranteed to become a useful tool in your teaching toolkit.\r\n\r\n* Adult Literacy\r\n\r\nAdult learners love the design of the program because it teaches them to read clearly and directly, without insulting them.

        "descriptionHTML": "This app is a must-try for parents, teachers, and tutors who teach reading to students of any age. It is also excellent for self-study to improve reading and English pronunciation.<br><br>Ultimate Phonics is useful in any situation where reading is taught:<br><br>* Beginning Readers<br><br>Did you know that many children never become good readers? Reading is the most important skill for education and success. If you have young children first learning to read, you can give them the gift that lasts a lifetime by teaching them with Ultimate Phonics. Just an hour per week can make a huge improvement in their reading ability.<br><br>* Struggling Readers<br><br>Do you have children or students who guess and skip when they read? Did you know that word guessing causes poor reading comprehension and terrible spelling? Relying on word guessing prevents students from becoming good readers and cripples their education.<br><br>A good reader reads by rapidly and accurately sounding out new words. That is exactly what Ultimate Phonics teaches. It develops your students into more accurate, fluent readers with good reading comprehension.<br><br>* Dyslexia and Orton-Gillingham<br><br>Ultimate Phonics is very effective for teaching dyslexics to read. The app can be used either by itself or as a supplement for Orton-Gillingham programs or other programs designed to overcome dyslexia.<br><br>If you are an Orton-Gillingham teacher, you will love this app. It has excellent word lists and decodable sentences, all broken down and sounded out. The app also has a Find feature that lets you look up lessons matching any phonogram in a matter of seconds. This app is a great supplement to any Orton-Gillingham program and is guaranteed to become a useful tool in your teaching toolkit.<br><br>* Adult Literacy<br><br>Adult learners love the design of the program because it teaches them to read clearly and directly, without insulting them.

            "This app contains the material needed to teach reading. It has the sound, words and sentences. However, I think the full app possibly has too many lessons, as it tries to teach nearly every possible combination of letters that make a sound. Also, it is very dry. It is like a text book. For these same reasons, I think it would work quite well with an adult or older child who wants to learn to read. The trial version is free, though, so go ahead and try it.",
            "Amazing app to learn phonics! I use the desktop app in class/via Zoom lessons (it was a life-saver during pandemic!) with my students. They download the app to practice at home (first 50 lessons on phone/tablet-based app are free). It's hard to practice phonics solo if you can't check for correct pronunciation. This way, students immediately discover if they read a word correctly. Eliminates frustration, reinforces their efforts and builds in success! They love it. Great tech support too!",
            "I stop working on my reading in 2017 but this is a great app are perfect to teach reading *****5 I meant the app at the Read LITERALLY COUNCIL in Birmingham Alabama between the year of 2014&2016 and now I own the phone app now Lessons 1-260 if I new about the app years ago I would have been reading by now",

When I finally realized I was being charged $37 US per month I figured out how to canc it through Google but was told there is a no refund policy. I did not use the app after the trial period and think I should get my money back. Apps make it easy to use but difficult if you are trying to unsubscribe or cancel.",
            "I believe the best feature of this help is the videos of kids are actually kids. They don‚Äôt sound bossy as an adult would seem to a kid with autism. Since they‚Äôre peers to my daughter, she gets encouraged to imitate them and learn from them. We‚Äôve seen the improvement in weeks. She sounds better day by day and the app is obviously beneficial but also fun at the same time enough to keep her focused without feeling like lectured."

Otherwise they hear the word pronunciation over and over without getting the association to the meaning. EDIT: Yes, we sit with him using it and try to make it fun for him.",
            "Kept seeing ads for this, so I downloaded it! Started the free trial before I decided to buy a subscription, and so glad I did! I couldn't even get a single activity done. There was no sound, the screen kept freezing and the app keeps force closing. Waste of time.",
            "If I could give it a zero I really would as I should've read the reviews first before purchasing. This App is an absolute disaster, waste of time energy and money. I paid for the free trial and the available activities for my 24 month old son to use are so limited with only one activity in each section. I am trying to cancel subscription after ten mins of use its proving to be a headache and not that simple. Can someone pls advise and instruct me on how to cancel subscription ASAP pls. Thanks",
            "On android you do have child lock like you do on iOS, also when it comes to pressing the buttons on the screen the entire screen is active so of my son holds the device with his left thumb on the screen he can't complete the actions like skip forward it take a photo as it doesn't use multi touch. Such a shame that they add these to iOS but not Android.",
            "My 3 year old lost interest quick. Only part she liked was the photo filters."

Even the singing is helping me improve my weakness academecly wise, even if is a bit annoying. I am learning things I didn't learn in highschool. ( Word problem age) needed it. I thank playstore, along with everybody involve in this project. I understand algebra and readying better. Thanks again, Make more app educational wise, plz, You got my support.",
            "My son doesn't like that there are too many songs in this app that take too long. He says he would rather they explained the material without singing. He says he would give it half a star if he could.",
            "Have used this on Windows 10 laptops, a Mac Computer, iPhone, iPad, Kindle Fire 7 tablet - works well on the iOS devices, but not well on the Kindle Fire 7 - I wish it did, as I love the Fire - but often the video gets out of sync with the sound.  My students love it - and I have 5 on it right now on Windows 10 laptops - no syncing problems at all.  When one logs out, there seems to be a 3 or 4 or 5 minute delay before that student can log in again, to the same account.  A bit of a problem when the Kindle would log me out for some unknown reason a bunch of times.  We did get through all the lessons on the Fire and only found one that didn't work -  and we get to try this for free for another year.  A great step in the right direction for apps for adult literacy.  Wish that it worked on the inexpensive FIre 7.  I will purchase a Fire 8 and see if the increased memory solves the syncing and logging out issues.",
            "I was forced to use this app but its not a good one, there's songs before the lessons that go on forever and you can't skip, don't get this app, its not worth it",

            "I really really like this app, DBT saved my life -- I still have much to improve upon. Practicing DBT on a daily basis has helped me to regain control of my emotions and allows me to stay focused and determined. DBT Coach is outstanding as a stand alone app, but for me personally it provides an effective substitution for a therapist during this transtion until I am able to afford individual sessions again.",
            "For $11.99 a month the app keeps crashing when certain lessons are opened. So you're paying for an app the only some content works. It's a shame because if it worked properly it would be worth it.",
            "The app is WAY overpriced. I would not balk for a minute at a $5.99/month subscription but this is priced out of the market, especially since it is a health care focused app. The language is not in vernacular English all the time, which is annoying. Hire an editor for clarity is a pretty minimal ask for short, static screens and would cost very little. The validation skill could be broken down to Self and Others because they are different skills. Ever since the upgrade to add the annoying Red Crisis Face, I cannot edit my entries or view the distress tolerance skills. So I have used this app for two weeks and now cannot access/use the data accurately for my appointment tomorrow. If reliability matters, don't use the free version of the app; I cannot speak to the reliability of the paid version.",
            "I see potential. Needs better design and pricing. Will continue to use it to see how far I can go with free version. Also, needs someone to refresh the writing for a general audience. The video tour doesn't seem to work on my phone. Design is not intuitive. I had to figure it out by clicking around.",
            "Like the app, but it doesn't save your entry more times than not. Very frustrating."

I also can't stand when I'm listening to an audiotext and the voice changes midway through, so ic really prefer to stay with the current narrator. P.S. if you want better ratings try uploading books like the Stalking Jack the Ripper series for older dyslexia readers.",

It's definitely something that if I didn't *need* it so bad I wouldn't use it *because* of the app. The app is glitchy and rereads the same pages over and over, shut off at random times, the pages must be manually turned much of the time or it gets sick/goes back to the page you started on at random intervals (too bad if you didn't know your pg #), it shuts off w/ the screen, and there's no option to control the playback from the lock screen.",

Also, the app keeps crashing and stopping out of the blue. Does it has unresolved bugs? Please, I want my contribution to matter. Thanks",

Big issue though is that it needs internet access to open the app. Big turn off not being able to use the app at all in offline mode.

It could also be used to illustrate a sequence of steps required to complete a more complex task (for example, pictures labeled with a short word or phrase can be used in sequence to teach the child how to brush his teeth, plant a seed, do simple chores around the house or activities at school, or even more complex tasks, such as accessing a computer, using the remote control to watch TV, using household appliances or work related tasks). \r\nA visual schedule is a significant part of supporting the learning of children and adults with learning difficulties.

Worse yet, Google Play denied a refund of the $3.49 purchase price, despite my  requesting the refund within less than an hour of purchase. I uninstalled the app, re-downloaded, and now all I have access to is the free version; I can't even use the limited functionality I paid for in the first place!  I've written to the developer to request a direct refund, and will update this review with their response."

            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",

The ads r purposely places so u hit them accidentally. And the info (I'm sure/assume/hope) was obviously taken word for word from a text, plopped on here THE END. You've seen this game b4. The app design took 32 seconds. It REEKS of JUNKY. And we all loathe the ads that r perfectly placed. Not to mention that the creator has all the data he needs I'd go so far to ban the creator. But if you're Indian n , u show this naive way about u, have no fear. \"Yes but how do REALLY feel?\" I feel the creator should be sent to Guantanamo",

            "I really enjoyed this app and it will be easy for the younger users to maneuver and those that may have limited motor skills. It can be used as a good morning starter in the classroom or for a 5-minute in class break. This app offers a variety of activities that involve listening to stories such as folk-tales, fiction, non-fiction, and comic books. The user also has access to clip-and-drag puzzles to make sentences, clip-and-drag words to puzzle blocks, plays, Greek myths, Chinese fables, and a variety of lessons on morals, opposites, etc. However, there are in app purchases that will need to be made in order to gain access to other activities such as the talking library, money, and math links. I particularly like the way the stories are told. The words are highlighted as the narrator reads and the pages will not turn until the user clicks for it to, which may encourage the user to look at the illustrations to make predictions, perhaps try to read the words, and etc. Overall, I find this app to be very useful, especially for younger users and for those who struggle with reading and just needs something fun to play while increasing reading skills and much more.

            "A useful app, keeps the mind active, although I have two main observations: the first is that the training 'games' are in fact testing your knowledge in relation to 'speed'. All tasks are time sensitive, and you are encouraged to answer or respond to actions in as short as time as possible. I'm sorry, that is not necessarily going to improve an individuals grammar or math in any way. Secondly, there should be a way to choose your level, (or beginner to advanced)",
            "Love it! So good! Currently doing maths and English at college so this in my spare time or just whenever I fancy a little phone time is ideal! Unfortunately I don't wanna buy the full version yet! Quite pricey! But I'm sure i will at some point! Maybe if it had a little monthly subscription I'd be more up for it. But yea, for now I will enjoy the free version until I can splurge out. I'll keep an eye out for a price drop also",
            "I wouldn't necessarily say it is a brain training app, more of what you understand at a point of time. Due to the timer in the games, you never really take in the mistakes you make, so nothing gets retained. Also, some of the games are really boring, I lose interest half way through a lot of the times and I have to restart them.",
            "This is very sophisticated, very artful, beautiful to see, and fun. Good algorithm's for challenging you based on your progress - just enough to keep you egaged and learning without being discouraged. There is a large number of activities . VERY clever design of games. I \"train\" (play) daily. I have learned things that I have used elsewhere. I am 67 years old too.",
            "This is a really good app! I have to say it's never crashed my phone before and it uses very little battery. However recently I've had to change this review as my training streak had mysteriously disappeared even though I have done my session everyday. It was up to about 130 days so I am hoping you will put it back as I have emailed twice. You said you have replied to me via email however I have not received an email on the dates you have said to have said to have sent one."

            "Just recently downloaded this app and started the monthly subscription. I'm really enjoying the app and it seems to have some very useful content overall, but there seems to be an issue with sound on the videos. Sometimes when I try to play a video, there is no sound despite the volume on my phone being on and turned up. I've tried turning on the captions, but the captions aren't always completely accurate to what's being said in the video, which makes it difficult to follow.",

            "I have been in ACT for a while. It is the best therapy for anxiety. This app is great for my practice. All the exercises are very useful along with the summary, mood correlations, streak etc. You have done a fantastic job with this app. It is very exhaustive at the same time very useful. Keep up the good work.",
            "I use this both app as well as the clinician app. After a long day with clients it helps to track my own behaviors, measures etc.. I have used ACT for so long, and this app really brings it home DBT is a useful toolbox and I use it after my draining sessions. The clinician tool is pretty awesome. Since the app is in both ios and android and integrates with the clinician app, I don't need any other resources for my ACT practice. I can assign homework - lessons, exercises etc. via the clinici"

        "description": "Do you know that 80% of learning problems are reading problems? Difficulties, such as dyslexia or hyperlexia, in reading can explain 60% of school failure.\r\n\r\nReadUp by Glifing is the game that improves children's reading and reading comprehension using the Glifing method. It is a method that children with reading difficulties can benefit from, regardless of whether they suffer from dyslexia, reading disorder, ADHD, Down syndrome, specific language disorder, stuttering ..., as well as children who already read well but want to read with more fluidity and ease. In addition, it is a complementary application to those already used by schools to teach reading and to reinforce reading. There are already more than 80,000 children around the world who have managed to improve.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is aimed at children between 6 and 12 years old who are learning to read or who want to improve or perfect their level. Children with 4 or 5 years old who have a knowledge of letters can also play and learn.\r\n\r\nAvailable in Spanish and Catalan.\r\n\r\nReadup by Glifing is divided into reading levels. At the beginning of the game, a level test is carried out on the child to know what their reading level is, this reading level is not linked to the school year, in this way they can learn and improve from their real level.\r\n\r\nWithin a reader level there are islands and each island has 30 missions to complete. In all missions you are accompanied by the Readup dragon. This friendly character is the mascot for the child and provides instructions to the adult or tutor on how to carry out each of the missions.\r\n\r\nA mission brings together all the phases that make up the Glifing method:\r\n\r\n1. Phonological path of reading. Train decoding by reading pseudowords.\r\n2. Lexical path of reading. Train the recognition of frequent words globally.\r\n3. Memory training. Strengthens memory, where the phonological imprint and visual memory are improved.\r\n4. Reading comprehension. It requires understanding in the context of previous mission activities.\r\n\r\nIn each mission you can get up to 3 stars, these are determined according to the successes that have been completed in each of the previous activities.\r\n\r\nFinally, so that the playful part of the game is understood, at the end of the mission, there is a minigame, the objective of which is to feed the dragon, and here you can also obtain gems depending on how well it is done.\r\n\r\nStars and gems can be used to customize the dragon in Readup's Dragon Shop. Therefore, the more you play, the more missions will be completed, and the more fun customizations you can make to the dragon.\r\n\r\nWe believe that parents or guardians are an essential part in the education of children, for this reason, in each mission it is required that the lexical and morphological path activities be carried out jointly with them, that is, it will be the parent or guardian who determines if the child has pronounced the word correctly. When it is not possible to be together, the tutor mode can be disabled and those missions are marked with an exclamation to remember that that part is missing to complete it. We know that there are automatic methods of voice recognition, but we are committed to strengthening the relationship between parents (or guardians) with children.\r\n\r\nGlifing is based on its own method registered under a research project carried out at the UB (University of Barcelona).

            "Absolutely frustrating every time I use it I faff around with it for about 10 minutes to get it to actually work instead of reading buttons and URLS and then it will either crash/freeze my computer. If you'e been recommended this because of you're AD(H)D I would not recommend, all it will do is demotivate and frustrate you that you will not get any work done. Funnily enough this is the most productive the app has made me since installing it. I've fiddled around with settings, youtube tutorials and it is still as disappointing and painful since opening it.",
            "Cannot get the app to work. Keyboard keeps crashing so unable to use the app at all. No support found online either which is a shame as it would be useful to have on my tablet.",
            "Its installed I opened a google chrome page assuming that this extension would be in the available at the top of the page, but I don't see it. I can't figure out howbto retrieve it. Also the apps keyboard doenst have good auto spell, it very easy to type typos, and the keys vibrate when you type which is annoying.",
            "App does not respond ,which inturn causes my keybord to malfunction since you control it through the keyboard. Sadily it costs money and the app is useless if this is not addressed.",
            "It does not work on my tablet. Whenever I open the app it goes to the writing option screen.... and that's it. So it's a waste of time and money since I'm paying for it out of my tuition."

            "This app is amazing, but at first I thought the people who were giving examples were trying to compete with me so I got a bit under pressure but then I found out that wasn't the case, I wanted to learn Italian so I went onto some lessons and they were great there were people there to pronounce the words for you so it's just FABULOUS.",
            "Amazing app for revision, the key is to let it notify you over other apps, so that you never lose progress, highly recommend for year 10 + or anyone who needs revision for a test in general!"

Ideal for when you‚Äôre out and about and your infant is getting bored or upset, when your toddler won‚Äôt settle and getting up to mischief or when you just want to relax your kids before bed time ‚Äì distract and get their attention with some visual stimulation in a joyful way!\r\n\r\nThis sensorial app has many unique features in comparison with other sensory based games, such as the firework, bubble, balloon pop and finger paint games available. Choose to amuse your baby with this visually stimulating, interactive, sensory game.\r\n\r\nNot only will this sensory app delight your kids, it will also provide increased educational benefits. From the early stages of your babies development, they are constantly learning and absorbing information around them, they begin to see, touch, feel, hear and understand how their interactions are affecting the environment around them. Your baby will begin to learn that touching the screen will cause bubbles to be created. Your child can drag your finger across the screen to create a pattern of bubbles. Your newborn can place their hands on the screen to cause lots of bubbles to be created at all points on the screen that they are touching. \r\n\r\nWith sensory fish, your child will experience and educate themselves by use of the cause and effect techniques and features implemented. As your baby touches the screen, they gain instant feedback of a vibration, sound effects and bubbles. They will eventually begin to understand that their touch is also causing the fish to swim towards where they touched. If they were to touch the screen in multiple position, the fish will swim between all of those touched positions! Your baby learns and adapts to their findings within the game. \r\n\r\nAs the game is fairly simple to understand and not too complex, it is ideal for young kids, boys and girls of ages from 0 months (with a parent showing them the game), up to the late kindergarten / preschool stage of their development where they fully understand and can control all aspects of the world and have learned exactly what the cause will be from their actions.\r\n\r\nSensory game play is great for the continued development of your kids motor skills and hand eye coordination development. It aids in helping to fine tune the motoric skills and movements, the very detailed movements that we require and use every day.\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown to have great benefits in learning and stimulation for children with autism and children with special educational needs (SEN). Having already received excellent feedback from parents who have children with autism, special educational needs (SEN) and learning disabilities. \r\n\r\nInstall now!

It doesn't work. My child can instantly get out of the app and not by hitting the back and home buttons together either. Nearly useless if she can get out of almost instantly.",

            "Has some serious bugs, like coming out of sleep mode messes up your session. very infuriating trying to teach your kid and accidentally pressing the sleep or home button and not being able to get back into the session. I actually bought the premium version. Not sure if it happens in the free version. Downgrade score: i wanted to teach my daughter math from 1+1 to 9+9. Can't really teach her the higher level numbers like 9+9 because when you hit the 10-20 option it asks you stuff like 17+2. :(",
            "Would be nice to have a reportcard to see how my girls are doing . Also it would be nice to see if upgrading is month to month fee or one time fee ? With so many apps out there , Would like test run of full app to see if money is worth the game .",

People are just being hammered in many ways and that lead to their collapse in the direction of their genetic susceptibility and biological weakness.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app is developed as a tool for introspection and will provide you with evidence-based information about emotional problems and mental disorders. It will teach you cognitive behavioural therapy and other self-help methods, and techniques, specifically designed to help with overcoming depression, generalized anxiety and worry, social anxiety and shyness, divorce and separation, loss and bereavement. It will help you test yourself, identify your problems and bring order in your life by tackling your negative thoughts and habits.\r\n\r\nThe CBT app provides practices, examples, and exercises that will help you assess and understand the roots of your worries and teach you how to suppress your negative thinking. Cognitive behavioural therapy is proven to be effective in the long term by applying the techniques and shift the way you think.

It will also help you to practice ways of living your life and relating to people that leave you less vulnerable to depression.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tIn the Anxiety and Worry (GAD) section you will have the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and worry and whether you are a worrier. A helpful set of strategies will show you how to deal with the purpose, meaning, and content of your worries. And, at the end, you will have a different perspective on how to manage it. The program will help you tackle your mental habits, address your feelings and practice different behaviors.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tIn the Social Anxiety section, you will have the opportunity to learn more about social anxiety and how to overcome shyness, reassess your predictions about how things turn out for you and challenge the way you interpret others' responses to you. This program will teach you practical attention strategies to decrease your self-consciousness, social exposure exercises, and some social communication tips.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tIn the Divorce and Separation section, you will learn about specific coping skills practices and training and helpful general practical advice. Along the way, it is worth remembering that the process of recovery from separation and divorce takes time, sometimes a long time. Rather than judge yourself for not going fast enough, it is important to give yourself credit for any small steps you make to help yourself or your children adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tIn the Bereavement and Loss section, you'll find information about grief and loss, including what is actually happening when we experience grief, common emotional reactions to loss, and unhelpful myths and expectations about grief.

            "Hey 7 Cups Team! I really like the idea of your network. But this app definitely needs improvements. I am visual impaired so I had my phones font size in a large level... which wasn't possible with this app. I couldn't open a chat or other things. I tried to use it with TalkBack then, which didn't work as well. Please improve the app and make it more accessible. Thanks!",
            "Great concept but needs improvement. The chat function is glitchy, and there's more functionality on the website than the app. I really wanted to use this app and might change my review if the bugs are fixed. The initial bot chat interface bounces around back to the top and gives error messages. Was not able to take some sort of evaluation because of it. I thought the monthly subscription was for talking with a therapist. But that's another $150.",
            "notifies whenever someone like a listener says something to you, it's more faster to access than on your computer, and it's pretty good overall :) all of the features aren't on there like on a computer but it still provides you with the important things like the communities, forums, and chats with people! i was surprised with how supportive and friendly <3 the people are on here that listens to what you have to say and you can help out people by becomimg a listener which can make you feel good!",
            "Very Helpful! I was pleasantly surprised with how much this app assisted me in a time of great stress and frustration. My only complaint was that the chat was extremely glitchy when I tried to scroll up and read the older messages above, it wouldn't let me at times. Hopefully they can fix the chat glitches to make it more user friendly, because then it would be perfect.",
            "I would love to give this app 5 stars but I can't. It's just that whenever I feel down, I go chat with the bot but the app glitches so much that I can't even read the messages. One time we are discussing something new but then it glitches out and it puts me onto an older part of our conversation. I- I just don't know what to do. I know it was not intentional, but still. Please fix this. 7 Cups has a lot of potential and I would be sad if it was all wasted."

Now she tries every time I run through a word list with my 5 yr old grand daughter. Perfect for trips when boredom sets in, esp. if little treats are at the end of a successfully completed list. Love this app.",

The only complaint is the pro edition costs WAY too much ($30/ yr) when the free edition already has more than enough. It's one of the best CBT apps out there, would highly recommend!",
            "I downloaded this app with low expectations but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how amazing it is. The interface is simple and clean, helps you organize things very flexibly and I really love the \"Check Thought\" feature that allows you analyze how a negative thought may have a contortion and helps you find your wisdom in challenging the thought. 15/10 would recommend ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",
            "this app is really good to have on hand. My friend uses this app frequently and recommended it to me. I may only use it once a month or so but catching that thought and being able to break it down in easy steps is really helpful. It's also makes it easier to go back and remind yourself of those descions and the thought process, highly recommend.",
            "I like the simplicity of the app. It's not overwhelming to look at. The layout makes it easy to use. I would give it 5 stars, but I feel that an app helping teach CBT skills through journaling should have more features available without needing a premium version.",
            "A good app for keeping track of your thoughts and worries. The only detraction is that some features are locked behind a premium service. Since using the app I have been able to keep better track of my mood and thoughts as well as notice patterns in my behaviours I wouldn't have otherwise. A great choice for anyone utilizing CBT or anyone looking to gain a better understanding of themselves"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic‚Äîit helps you solve your own problems.&quot; <br><br><i>- Quartz</i><br><br>&quot;In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.&quot;<br><br><i>- Wired</i><br><br>&quot;Replika‚Äôs growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren‚Äôt available.&quot;<br><br><i>- Forbes</i><br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure why but it took a while to work up the nerve to make the call. When I finally did, it was much more fun than I expected. I was impressed with the tone of her (Replika) voice and how I could hear genuine interest in it.&quot;<br><br><i>- Business Insider</i>",

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

            "love the app and my daughters (7 and 5 years old) love it as well. My oldest greatly improved her math skills and quite rapidly. Also available in French (we are francophones). They love to collect stickers and stamps, and I can print certificates and activity sheets for them. Just amazing!!!",
            "This is a great app with visually appealing graphics, making it kid-friendly and fun. One suggestion would be to add more number range levels. The current levels allow for 0-5, 0-10 and 0-20, while it would be good to add ranges 5-10, 5-15, 10-15 and 15-20 as well. That way, more advanced learners could practice their skills in the higher number ranges. Furthermore, the app is fantastic. Well done! :-)",
            "My granson (who is 4 year old )loves playing this math learning game. It's great for preschoolers. It is simple, effective, and encouraging as the child learns. Above all it is fun learning numbers and math with this app. I love there are NO ADS to interrupt and distract the child while they're learning. Thank you for developing this free learning app for children.üëçüòÉ",
            "This is a very lovely app, and because of this app i helped my littke brother ALOT in math i am so happy our mother found this app(i also play it myself with my little brotherü§≠) Really amazing app people should make more apps like this. And there is no adds and it is completely free! Thank u for making this wonderful appü§©üíùüëç",
            "I find that because there is no sense of getting it right or wrong, they just try all the answers until one is correct. There is also no sense of progress before getting a sticker etc. The end result is that there is no game element and they get bored within 20 questions."

            "Great Spelling app. Has learning mode LM & testing mode TM. LM: good for visual/kinetic learners. Shows the spelling of each word at start (& can reshow the word); Has only correct letters to choose from when spelling. TM: harder version. Suggestion: 1) a record of child's progress/%. 2) more than one learning path for more kids 3) needs options eg: USA or UK spelling; number of words in each test; font; group words as families 4) be able to correct own mistakes in LM (particularly last letter)",
            "My three year old loves this game! easy to use, multiple difficulties. I love that it's available offline. We used the free version for a long time, but my kid mastered all the words and was ready for a bigger challenge. Some of the negative reviews are laughable considering my three-year-old can use it without issue. FYI it is in traditional British English, so there are a few minimal spelling and pronunciation variations. For example the way they spell practice with an s instead of c.",
            "I like this app. Our daughter is dyslexic and immediately jumped into the learning and testing which showed her she needed to really pay attention and work to progress. However i don't see scores shown to encourage progress. I would also like the option to have the letters read aloud l (and not) in learning mode.",
            "Your App is great bu there one limitation that is it does not sound when we click on a letter i e while writing PEN it should Pa when we click on Letter P, While clicking on letter E it should sound e, while clicking on letter N it should sould sound na, so that children can learn letter and their joining automatically, with out any external help. I hope you will look into my suggestion.",

Not to mention, if the user has trouble reading, they will need someone to read the screen. I like the concept & some of the topics. For example, the first lesson is about how not everyone is your friend (which some child or people w/autism struggle with). There's also a lesson on online safety.",

There is a lot of text and not a lot of action. It is basically hearing a lesson and then taking a quiz. I was really hoping to get to play through some actual scenarios. Knowing the types of kids who would benefit from the skills taught, they would get bored pretty quickly.",

Fun and colourful character designs and very well animated, practical and theory questions, has clear examples and lists that really make it simple to digest. Essential for anyone who struggles socially. Super app! :)  Couple minor issues, during \"when we argue with friends\" after \"what kind of statements..\" the characters disappear. And during \"going to a friends house\" quiz \"Ellie is going to a party\" it accepts the dog food option as the answer."

            "I love this app! I have been trying to keep my anxiety under control and I came across this app, I only have the free version so far but I can see myself purchasing the extras because its helping me so much! The only complaint I have is the voice recordings crackle midway through and its distracting. If this were fixed it would honestly be the best app I've ever downloaded. Thank you for making this wonderful app!",
            "I tried to get a straightforward answer from them regarding the full set of features and costs for the two paid upgrades (Pro and Plus). After about 20 minutes of feeling like I was talking to a politician with talking points (that is, they just kept dodging the question and repeating answers that did not address what I was asking about), I simply gave up.",
            "So far this app is great! I've only used it for a week or so now, but even just tracking my moods and writing them out helps me release some anxiety. I find the guided exercises helpful in putting my negative thoughts into perspective. I've been recommending this to many of my friends. While it's not a replacement for a therapist, it's a great way to check in with yourself each day. I hope they add therapy sessions outside of India someday! I'm sure it would help a lot of people.",
            "So far I LOVE this app, it has already made a HUGE difference for me. More than anything else I have tried and I have been dealing with the same mental health problems for years and years. I really would love the premium but since the covid pandemic it's basically impossible for me to afford the premium. ‚òπÔ∏è I really wish there was another way for me to get the premium. Thank you SO much for making this app!!",
            "The free services are everything you need except completely personalised options. So its a win in my book already. The bot is well made and is useful wherever you are (I've mostly had to use her in class, it was quick and easy without anyone noticing) Im keeping this app, it hasn't given me any trouble so I'd say if you see this on your for you page or in the search options its completely worth a shot."

She just started Pre K and she is doing well because all of these different learning apps she's practiced over and over again have made it easier for to understand and recognize because she has already seen and practiced them. Thank you very much",

Like the 2 should have nothing to do with one another. It gets frustrating when I have to keep going to G.L. to unmute it. If it wasn't for that, this would be getting g 5 stars.",
            "We have been using this app for about a year with my autistic 4 year old grandson and he loves it. My 2 year old granddaughter has used it just as long and knows all her shapes and colors. They love using this app. We also have added some of the other ones too. The 2yr old is do great on the alphabet tracing and has now learned 10 letters. I would recommend this app to all parents and teachers form preschool to kindergarten . You won't be sorry you downloaded this app.",

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my R√†ting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good üôÇüëçüèª",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Let's face it, there are hardly any words in this free edition of the app. It's not really an app to use, only to see if you want to buy the full version. And even then, there are hardly enough words to tell if I want to. Also, the animations between words are ridiculously long, and I've checked the \"shorter animations\" box already in settings. It's like 10 seconds - WAY too long! Don't bother with this one. Nice concept but not worth it.",
            "Concept is great and kids can learn really fast but why are the animations between words so long? (may be there is a hidden way to go to the next letter without suffering thru a whole minute or two of boring animations) Even I got bored with them, and thought something was wrong with the app. Please make them smaller, 2-3seconds maximum.",

            "Awesome game. It has many different options in each game type allowing my 3yr old a lot of selection. Some games allow you to change the difficulty. No ads. Rewarded with stickers and balloons after completing a level. Positive reinforcement and tips to encourage the child",

It starts with two letter words (At, Ot, En), followed by Spelling Three letter CVC words (consonant, vowel, consonant) Bat, Cat, Rat, Pen etc.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, this process involves collecting and filtering the suitable words and print these words to create flashcards. These flashcards are then presented as a joining cards demonstration to a group of students in the classroom.\r\n\r\nSince these cards are supposed to be presented repetitively for reinforcement, the difficult handling of printed cards makes it a tiresome and a classroom specific activity.\r\n\r\nIn this ‚ÄúLearn Three 3 Letter Words Spelling‚Äù App, we have searched and filtered maximum suitable words and compiled them into ONE interactive learning app.\r\n\r\nThe app is primarily made for teaching assistance and can be effectively used in the classroom. It is equally good for parents to reinforce the concept in their homes.\r\n\r\nIt not only saves printing, makes all the repetitive tasks automated, but also provides progress monitoring which makes it more effective than printed sheets.\r\n\r\nThe app is very simple to use. It starts with one of 14 provided categories (Collection of AT, OT, ED Words etc) with a basic animation about how A & T combines to form ‚ÄúAT‚Äù. Below you can find the possible letter combinations for drag and match to form the CVC word.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the word is formed and spoken, a corresponding image is shown for better understanding and teaching assistance.\r\n\r\nThe progress of learning individual word can be easily seen as a star is given for every word completion. A maximum of 5 stars are given and then the word is greyed out making it temporarily disabled. This functionality is provided for forcibly excelling to more words. The stars however can be reset to re-enable the greyed out words.\r\n\r\nThe continuous practice of all the words in every category makes the parent / teacher confident about introducing maximum words formation.\r\n\r\nClean & animated interface, beautiful relative images, studio quality voiceover and a handful selection of words makes it perfect for an ideal learning app.\r\n\r\nSalient Features\r\n\r\n14 Categories 84 Essential Words\r\nTeacher Proofread Content\r\nHigh Quality Images\r\nStudio Quality Voiceover\r\nStars for progress tracking\r\nInteractive & Animated\r\nClean & Attractive Interface\r\nIt is a must have educational app which is provided Free to download as a demo. There are a total of 14 categories with all essential words to practice for kids. It is strongly recommended to practice the ads-free and complete app to ensure a better understanding for words formation.\r\n\r\nApart from teaching basic spelling making technique, This app also improves vocabulary and promotes phonetic learning. The app is ideal to be practiced in the classroom and is equally beneficial to be practiced in the home.\r\n\r\nThe app consumes a very small amount of disk space, thus can be kept in the device for as long as required.\r\n\r\nYou can buy the complete app within the app itself.\r\n\r\nWe at ‚ÄúHoliday Educationist‚Äù have a team of trained & certified teachers to proofread the apps‚Äô content for the optimum quality assurance.",

Anyway, thank you for producing a good app. Hopefully, the flaw will be editted, and I will definitely download the app again.",

In a matter of few mins she was able to understand the blending which we were trying to teach her without this visual representation.

        "description": "Kids Play Visual Games is an app that consists of 15 educational games developed to reinforce skills of visual and spatial perception, aimed at kids of all ages.\r\nEach of these games will help your child to process information and implement visual skills through fun eye exercises, accompanied by our raccoon pet and its animal friends, which will compliment and encourage kids every time they solve the game.\r\n\r\nVISUAL ACUITY EDUCATIONAL GAMES \r\nThis visual stimulation at an early age acts as a reinforcement to help their cognitive development and prevent possible attention and concentration problems. Babies and children will learn to:\r\n\r\n- Identify shapes and colors.\r\n- Process spatial relation: orientation, size and position.\r\n- Associate silhouettes and elements.\r\n- Improve visual acuity searching objects.\r\n- Develop manual dexterity and motor skills.\r\n- Detect and classify intruders within a list of elements.\r\n- Differentiate figures and backgrounds.\r\n- Enhance their attention span and concentration.\r\n- Boost observation skills and difference perception.\r\n\r\nKids Play Visual Games are carefully designed with a simple interface in order to make children have fun while learning with animals and kid-friendly characters.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT DIFFICULTY LEVELS\r\nOur goal is that, whatever the intellectual capacity of the child may be, they can sharpen their visual acuity gradually. To do that, the game offers three difficulty levels (easy, medium and difficult), adapted to different ages and stages of development.\r\n\r\nEasy: Ideal for beginners, especially for babies and kids at an early age.\r\nMedium: Perfect for those children who are already familiar with the game.\r\nDifficult: Suitable for kids who have managed to solve each game quickly and don‚Äôt need supervision of parents or teachers to solve them.\r\n\r\nEDUJOY EDUCATIONAL GAMES \r\nThis app is part of an educational games collection created by Edujoy in order to help kids to develop new intellectual and motor skills from elements of their environment.\r\n\r\nAll our games are created by professional educators and psychologists in order to provide pedagogical content, necessary for the intellectual development of babies and children.\r\n\r\nWe love creating educational and fun games for you.

Another drawback is that it is in Spanish, and although it didn't hinder me from using and enjoying it, I guess many won't feel the same. Also, it cannot be moved to SDcard, but it's about 1MB installed, so that's not such a big burden. On the plus side, it has no ads!",

I have actively sourced another suduko game that has virtually no ads whatsoever. Thanks for your reply, However, my account WAS AD FREE, until I was advised I needed to update. I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",
            "Great game but a big memory hog and it has to stay on device, there is no option to move it to SD Card. Also, more time spent watching Ads than playing time. I play from the UK and the Non-representational Ads shown are banned by UK Trading Standards. It's on its way off my device ... UNINSTALLED.",
            "I am so furious! I subscribed for premium for a year and it worked for 3 days. I'm back to getting all the bloody annoying ads every few minutes. I hate it!! And the worst thing is there is no way to report it or contact them.",
            "Used to be great, but now the aggressive ads have killed it. I finish a puzzle in two minutes just to get hit with 2 back-to-back ads. I don't mind some advertising, but it's overkill now.",
            "The app was fine until they got all political. All the commercials have been for one party, like the are trying to jump on the main stream media ban wagon and shove the democratic party down everyone's throat. No thank you and I'm deleting the app. You can keep your one sided opinion."

            "The best writing app Ive used. Great graphics, music. Includes mini games to break up the writing every so often. Has rewards. Kids live it. Even bigger kids had a play! Lots of settings/options eg choose font; left handed; difficulty; formation style; voice off.",

            "Stupid. Only a few letters are free and you have to pay for the rest UPDATE: I appreciate responses from developers, if they are polite and accepting of customer opinions. This is not. I'm not actually sure what the point of your response is? Reviews are not feedback for apps (though they can be used that way, sometimes) they are for others potential customers to see what others like and didn't like. I'm sorry my customer REVIEW was not useful for YOU, but you were not the intended audience. So really... #sorrynotsorry"

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

            "The app in itself is good, and the price is certainly cheaper than a traditional therapist, but still too expensive for me I'm afraid. I think ¬£50 for 30 minutes and ¬£100 for 50 minutes is a bit of a scam. I had three sessions with my therapist, and had to stop because she was very slow and we still hadn't made any progress and I felt like I was losing my money... Not a great therapist either in my opinion, compared to others I talked to in the past. I didn't really feel understood, or heard.",
            "This app looks great and really helpful for those who need it. But the costs are just too much, it excludes and marginalises those with little money. When most have no access to NHS offerings and no money for private this app offers false hope. Make the costs more obvious before people sign up. Going through emotional questions and 'connecting' with a therapist to then find out that it's like ¬£49 for half an hour!?",
            "Waaaaay to expensive. ¬£99 per 50 minutes is ridiculous money. Don't waste your time. Look online at approved registers. You can get someone as qualified as people on this app for ¬£70 per 60 minutes. Furthermore the app or my therpaists camera/ sound quality was terrible. I couldn't hear or see my therapist but then I contacted family after and it was fine. Good idea but not worth it at all.",
            "This seems like a helpful app and I understand obviously why therapy is rather expensive. To improve it you could have an option for 13 or up or maybe even 5 and up with a parent. Although, I think when chosing a therapist you should have the therapists price range andcertain people may not feel comfortable with and may want to change. What I really liked was the audio tailored to your problem with the name of the therapist.",
            "Poor service for me. You fill in a few automated drop down boxes to vaguely describe your problems and symptoms. Then you get allocated a therapist to choose from then before actually speaking to anyone you're expected to pay before you've spoken to anyone to work out treatment plans and unanswered questions. I called the help line they told me to contact the therapist and told me how the therapist returned my message 3 days last saying I need to call the helpline. Still not answered questions"

Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that ‚Äúmy partner has to be perfect‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have to be 100% certain about my partner‚Äú - I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my ability to deal with relationships will decrease.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our well being.\r\n\r\nHOW GG APPS WORK\r\nThe application is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of negative and obsessive thoughts.\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts.\r\n3. Increase your access to neutral, adaptive and positive thoughts.\r\n4. Increase the accessibility of the above processes.\r\n5.

It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and relationship OCD.\r\n\r\nTRAIN YOUR THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe longer we train making it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your mind‚Äôs flexibility, start today!

It conditions the mind to think positively and embrace resilience and that is a beautiful thing. My husband is trying it now, too, and likes it as well. It has helped me already to have a more positive outlook and improved the way I relate to others. I wouldn't have believed it without trying it. So grateful!!",

It definitely helps with intrusive, obsessive thoughts that sometimes creep into my head for no reason. And it helps me keep my crazy under wraps, lol"

            "I was looking for an app where I could track macros but not calories. I end up restricting and getting too obsessive. This doesn't track macros but I couldn't care less. It's helping me to challenge my thoughts, to meditate, to breathe deeply, to reflect, to set goals and reminders of why it matters to find a healthy relationship with food. This app is truly lovely, thank you to the developers for helping me to recover.",
            "There is a lot about the app I like because it makes food journaling a lot easier however, I need at least 3 meals and 4 snacks a day, if not more, depending on how big my meals are, when I begin eating in the day, what time I go to bed etc. I need to eat every 2-3 hours and this app does not have enough reminders for that. Max 6 reminders isn't good enough!",
            "More than I ever could have found, truly blessed by it. It helps me focus on my inside world to become aware of my thoughts, emotions and behaviors and make changes from within instead of trying to control, measure and obsess about calories thinking constantly about food .... helps me take small steps, value the little achievements i have and constantly reminds me that I will get there ... to have complete freedom and peace around food and my body.",
            "Excellent tool. Keep up the exceptional work! It has been very useful to me and made the process very positive. Thank you!"

We've developed a game with which you can learn to read intuitively and individually, as you would play a game.\r\nWe believe that a learning game has to be so good that it would encourage you to play it even though you might not be interested in its pedagogical content. We've done our best to implement this idea in our game. In doing so, we incorporate psycho-pedagogical foundations and concepts from the Montessori method, improve upon such tools as phonetic charts and present the syllables as they are actually spoken and not as they would be if spoken separately. Our emphasis is not on learning to recite the alphabet or spelling out words; on the contrary, instead of learning the ABC off by heart, the pupil learns which sounds actually occur in each word. As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.\r\n\r\nShould you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org \r\n\r\nThe game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. You hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.",

            "I have this app on my computer. I use this not because I want to but because I have to. I LEGIT hate this app so much. I was pretty happy with my progress but I got a question wrong then it took me back to 84 points. The worst part is that I was almost at 100 points and it took some time. You will have to spend at least half an hour to finish a single lesson, seriously? I was about to break my computer. This app isn't the best learning app. I prefer clever instead.",
            "I have ben doing it for many years and i hate it. I understand it is supposed to help is learn but the point sistem makes that almost imposible. I have ben left in tears after getting to 90 and then loosing 10-20 points. You only get a few points for getting one right. The person who made it had good intent but is hated by every kid who is forced to use it.",
            "I can't really say much about the actual math and learning stuff about this app. My problem is with the point system. You earn 1 or 2 points every time you get a question correct, but lose about 10-20 points when you get one wrong. It's extremely frustrating and stressful to have to keep redoing everything because of a few small mistakes and the amount of times I've cried while doing this is embarrassing, so having a little kid doing this probably isn't a good idea.",
            "IXL pls improve the score count because if you go to the 90's sometimes it give you two scores to go up and sometimes one score to go up, but when you get something wrong it will be 10 or 5 6 7 8... and so on down and it will be frustrating to the people who tried their best to finish the problems and when they get it wrong they will want to stop, but some people get forced to finish, wich is not fair in my opinion, so can you pls fix this problem. Thank you.",
            "Honestly, it is one of the worst apps ever made. Because of it my stress levels fly when I get something wrong since it minuses like 20 when you get one wrong. I've cried many times about it. If you want to not ruin the lives of many students please put the minus scoring lower. Or you will be one of the lowest rated apps."

            "Great app. Everything but the subtraction. It is impossibly difficult starting numbers 24-5... I would be expecting 3-1 similar level to all the other maths levels. Seems to be a problem with the level settings. Please update",
            "Great game, kid loves it, but the rocket ship never blasts off. Add that, and it is 5 stars for sure",
            "I tried this version and my kid liked it. However, I found that difficulty did not increase at all at the same age level. It kept showing the same addition problems in the next chapters. It only increased difficulty a bit when you changed the age by using numbers instead of coins. I would have preferred some more variation of the math problems as you played through the chapters to cover more with the age of your child. It is fun though and it is nice that it combines fun with math.",
            "This game was great until the new update I've received has made this game digitally unstable, I'm going to delete and reinstall to see if that will fix the graphics on it cause my son keeps complaining. But as I had said before it's a good game. I've deleted the game and reinstall it but it's still not working properly.... The walk he runs on is gone and jumping down maybe eternal fall, Could you fix also I realized once deleted you lose buying this game, No code was given or anything to reclaim"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

It was originally designed to treat depression, but is now used for a number of mental disorders.\r\n\r\nIt works to solve current problems and change unhelpful thinking and behavior.[1] The name refers to behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and therapy based upon a combination of basic behavioral and cognitive principles.[1] Most therapists working with patients dealing with anxiety and depression use a blend of cognitive and behavioral therapy. This technique acknowledges that there may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through rational thought, but rather emerge based on prior conditioning from the environment and other external and/or internal stimuli. CBT is \"problem-focused\" (undertaken for specific problems) and \"action-oriented\" (therapist tries to assist the client in selecting specific strategies to help address those problems), or directive in its therapeutic approach. It is different from the more traditional, psychoanalytical approach, where therapists look for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then diagnose the patient. Instead, behaviorists believe that disorders, such as depression, have to do with the relationship between a feared stimulus and an avoidance response, resulting in a conditioned fear, much like Ivan Pavlov. Cognitive therapists believed that conscious thoughts could influence a person‚Äôs behavior all on its own. Ultimately, the two theories were combined to create what is now known as cognitive behavioral therapy.\r\n\r\nCBT is effective for a variety of conditions, including mood, anxiety, personality, eating, addiction, dependence, tic, and psychotic disorders. Many CBT treatment programs have been evaluated for symptom-based diagnoses and been favored over approaches such as psychodynamic treatments.

It was originally designed to treat depression, but is now used for a number of mental disorders.<br><br>It works to solve current problems and change unhelpful thinking and behavior.[1] The name refers to behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and therapy based upon a combination of basic behavioral and cognitive principles.[1] Most therapists working with patients dealing with anxiety and depression use a blend of cognitive and behavioral therapy. This technique acknowledges that there may be behaviors that cannot be controlled through rational thought, but rather emerge based on prior conditioning from the environment and other external and/or internal stimuli. CBT is &quot;problem-focused&quot; (undertaken for specific problems) and &quot;action-oriented&quot; (therapist tries to assist the client in selecting specific strategies to help address those problems), or directive in its therapeutic approach. It is different from the more traditional, psychoanalytical approach, where therapists look for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then diagnose the patient. Instead, behaviorists believe that disorders, such as depression, have to do with the relationship between a feared stimulus and an avoidance response, resulting in a conditioned fear, much like Ivan Pavlov. Cognitive therapists believed that conscious thoughts could influence a person‚Äôs behavior all on its own. Ultimately, the two theories were combined to create what is now known as cognitive behavioral therapy.<br><br>CBT is effective for a variety of conditions, including mood, anxiety, personality, eating, addiction, dependence, tic, and psychotic disorders. Many CBT treatment programs have been evaluated for symptom-based diagnoses and been favored over approaches such as psychodynamic treatments. However, other researchers have questioned the validity of such claims to superiority over other treatments. your knowledge, widen your expertise, improve your practice skills, Broaden your academic &amp; career horizons.<br><br>Disclaimer:<br>The publisher of this app is not affiliated with or endorsed by any testing organization.

I am guilty of leaving it unused on my phone for a while, but now that I have started using it daily (max efficiency, 500XP mode), I feel like there's some improvement already in a week or so.",
            "To the developers, Nice app. Really helpful. Just a few things I'd like you to look into: 1. There is no pause button during workouts. And if BACK, HOME or lock by mistake, and then return, the 1 min timer gets restarted. Some workouts don't work properly altogether after this problem. 2. To activate any plan, we need to click on the SETTING button. However, the SETTING button of the DRY EYE PLAN is not working properly.",

Visual acuity gets stuck displaying an object or letter (no questions or feedback) , Eye quiz and Accomodation say to swipe for next question but nothing happens when I do that. Kaleidoscope feature works. I remember these features working. I have a huawei p20 lite with android 9",
            "I wish the exercises reflected realistic daily routines. I wake at 5am normally, and 10a-3p is more late morning/afternoon. Broaden the time restrictions on the compiled exercises, please. I would be inclined to use the app way more.",
            "the exercises are nice and well put together. However, I can't judge their effectivness as the app \"reminders\" don't work, so I often forget to do the exercises on time. If it gets fixed, not only will I give it 5 stars, but will look into buying some of the plans."

If you are truly 100% new to coding then this is a good start for you, but I do not justify paying around $16 for this. Also, as a side note, the \"crazy deal\" they offer is just a marketing scheme. It'll always cost around $16 not the $100+ it suggests. If you wait for the time to run out on the deal, you'll notice it'll start again tomorrow.",
            "Very nice app. It is very useful for the beginers to learn Programming But you must allow course free of cost. After 3 levels we have to upgrade to pro. But not everyone can afford it or wants to afford it. Please make all the courses and Certificated programmes free of cost. It would be helpful for us.",

            "The app itself isn't bad. But somehow you can purchase versions of the Bible without having to put in a password or other identification using Google points. So my preschooler purchased about $12 worth of versions, which is very annoying! I have setting set in Google Play to require authentication for purchases, but somehow within this app, the 1-tap is still available. So I am going ot have to delete it so no more purchases are made. I am thankful I had the points and my credit card wasn't charged!",
            "Love the app, the functionality, and the appearance. However, there are still quite a few bugs that need to be worked out and the app often gives a semi-blank screen while I wait and waste time for my verses to load. Also, wish that you could follow others on the Android app like the Apple version let's you.",
            "This app used to be great - in fact, it was the best available for memorizing verses. Why do I give it one star? What happened? First, I got a new phone, and reinstalled it, signing into my account. Lo and behold, the Bible translation I had purchased was gone from my account. I had to buy it all over again. Second, it started to bug out on my android. Verses I saved would disappear, then there was absolutely nothing showing up when I opened up the app. I emailed the developers about this, and was told they were working on fixing it for the next update. As you can see, their last update was two years ago, which was about the time I sent my email. Needless to say, it's really disappointing to see how far an app can sink, especially since, again, this was the best one I'd ever found in terms of Bible memorization.",
            "I love this app. Sure there are a few bugs (android) still to be ironed out BUT it achieves what I downloaded it for ... Helping me memorise scripture! I'm 63 and have been a Christian for most of my life. I have always found it very difficult to memorise anything, let alone scripture. At last, a method that works! Awesome",
            "Technical issues everywhere. My first impression of this app after spending 6 dollars on a translation to memorize is that it's a buggy & unoptimized mess and I haven't been able to get to the content yet. If you press back too many times it logs you out completely (which is annoying) instead of taking you to a main menu. Pressing buttons in the UI here and then cause unintentional results and it's just a frustrating experience. Needs some serious TLC from app developer for sure."

As a parent including words and pictures on the spot by any means, that is, from our own photo gallery, from internet, or a photo taken there and then is also very essential. I would recommend Avaz to anyone who is in need to communicate in an alternative way other than speech or sign language, be it for children and adults alike. Thankyou.",

Until I found this app I had been using the OpenDyslexic extension on desktop but was out of luck for reading on mobile. This app solves that issue for me and has made reading on my phone much easier! The interface is very straightforward to use and offers contrast settings so you don't have to read black and white. (I would love if a sepia option was added in the future!)",

But there‚Äôs a solution: he can take his raft to the letter islands and recover the word treasure. This treasure will make him incredibly rich, mainly in knowledge and experience, so that he can rescue his crew from the grip of the sinister sea monster Analphabetus and buy himself a ship.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hippocampus' Spelling C is a game adapted to kids learning to read and speak but learners of all ages can enjoy it and have fun while learning intuitively and independently.\r\n\r\nIt's time for English! Learn how to pronounce and to write English words as well as words from other languages (see list below). You can learn how to read and how to speak. This is the free version.\r\nCan learning to read be as easy and exciting as playing a computer game? We've developed a game with which you can learn to read intuitively and individually, as you would play a game.\r\nWe believe that a learning game has to be so good that it would encourage you to play it even though you might not be interested in its pedagogical content. We've done our best to implement this idea in our game. In doing so, we incorporate psycho-pedagogical foundations and concepts from the Montessori method, improve upon such tools as phonetic charts and present the syllables as they are actually spoken and not as they would be if spoken separately. Our emphasis is not on learning to recite the alphabet or spelling out words; on the contrary, instead of learning the ABC off by heart, the pupil learns which sounds actually occur in each word. As such, double vowels, for instance, are never separated.\r\n\r\nShould you have any further questions about our pedagogical method or about the game itself, please feel free to contact us at: info@regentropfen.org \r\n\r\nThe game is adapted for children aged 4 to 8, regardless of whether the pupil goes to school, kindergarten, pre-school or primary school. Children in higher grade may also profit from the game in case of various reading and/or spelling difficulties such as dyslexia. You can also use the game to learn some basics of foreign languages, regardless of your age: thanks to the audio clips, you can discover learn the pronunciation of the individual phonemes in each word. Similarly to the  Pimsleur method, you hence not only learn a translation of the word, but have a native speaker show you the meaning and the spelling of each word. Of course, this is not meant to be a complete linguistic pedagogical environment: the words offered are all nouns and there are as of yet no adjectives, verbs and no punctuation. Learning the language is based here on a challenging speaking vocabulary trainer. This app however can be used as an interactive introduction to the acquisition of speaking skills for individual words. The game does not contain a dictionary and is not split up in individual lessons, but rather in levels with various themes such as pirates, animals or vehicles.\r\n\r\nContains: English, German, French, Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian, Italian, Turkish, Polish, Danish, Swedish, Bulgarian, Catalan, Georgian, Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, Greek",

The feedback for the missed questions helped me know my weeknesses and where to focus on. Thanks to this incredible and free app, I passed my TEAS exam. This app deserves a 5+ starts!",

            "If I said thanks then this is not enough and it will never be enough. By all means, this app is remarkable and so useful. Since my childhood I used to have problems with Math and till today actually I still but with this app I am developing myself a day by day and it really works. I have a suggestion for you to make this app perfect. Try to add more games that is suitable for all ages. Like what? Algebra, geometry and Trigonometry Basics and add a particular part for High school students.",
            "Its, well, boring. A lot of games have no total timer, you can go on indefinitely if you don't make a mistake. Which would be fine, if the there were difficulty levels that persisted across game instances. As far as I can tell, I start at level 0 every time. And I simply don't feel like spending 10 minutes on 2-1 type calculations every time in hopes it gets more challenging later on. I guess if could be meant for children...",
            "The game is very nice, helpful to solve simple mathematical problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).But there is not percentage operator which is very important in daily life. And the 2048 game is so boring!!!",
            "The games are very challenging. They're really good for our brain. I'm enjoying the games specially that they're offline. Thank you very much for developing these games. They are very helpful to us who are getting older."

I've also noticed that the achievement/task/etc icons on the bottom bar disappear. I have to restart the app to open them, and claim the rewards from them. Overall, the app has room to improve. Especially with the reward features not always being accessible. The amount of ads could also be lessened...",
            "I enjoy the variety of brain games I can play using this app. It helps reduce the number of games I have downloaded. The graphics remind me of the 80's Atari games but I don't play this for the graphics. The only downside is all the ads. Way too many ads for the amount of game play.",
            "This game is challenging but yet relaxing. I have seen zero glitches and there aren't so many ads that you feel you spend more time watching ads then playing the game. I also have my MIL who has dementia playing it to try to help keep her brain sharp.",

Children will learn how to identify easier fully-formed emotions and more difficult subtle emotions. The game is highly customizable to meet the needs of children with varying skills, ability levels, and learning styles.\r\n\r\nThis game was designed by Dr Holly Gastgeb, a clinical and developmental psychologist with over ten years of experience working with typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Her research has shown that children with ASD have difficulty identifying emotions from an early age. Since this ability is developed throughout childhood, the game is beneficial for a wide range of children including early achievers without any diagnosed learning difficulties.\r\n\r\nLearn with Rufus: Feelings and Emotions is organized into a learning phase and two games:\r\n‚Ä¢ Learning - A preview of the facial expressions is shown to the child before the game starts.\r\n‚Ä¢ Find It! - Shown a number of facial expressions, the child is directed to select a specific emotion.\r\n‚Ä¢ Name It! - Shown a single facial expression, the child is asked to name the emotion.\r\n\r\nTo keep children interested and motivated, the following features are included:\r\n‚Ä¢ Reward sets - Choose from nine different colorful child-friendly reward sets including bugs, cars, cats, and more.\r\n‚Ä¢ Toy break - The child is given periodic breaks with fun on-screen fingerpainting. This feature can be turned off if the child does not need breaks or finds them distracting.\r\n‚Ä¢ Positive reinforcement - Rufus does a \"happy dance\" and gives positive verbal reinforcement when the child answers correctly. If the child answers incorrectly, the correct answer is restated.\r\n‚Ä¢ Music and sounds - Child-friendly music and sounds are included. This feature can be turned off if the child is sensitive to or distracted by sounds and music.\r\n‚Ä¢ Text - The word that corresponds to each picture is presented above the picture. This feature can be turned off if the words are distracting to the child.\r\n‚Ä¢ Emoticons - Emoticons that correspond to the emotions are presented. This feature can be turned off to increase difficulty.\r\n\r\nAdditional customizable features that are present include:\r\n‚Ä¢ Level of difficulty - The level of difficulty can be adjusted to match the child's ability level:\r\nEasy - Facial expressions with quickly identifiable emotions\r\nMedium - Facial expressions with a mix of slightly less identifiable emotions\r\nHard - Facial expressions with partially formed emotions\r\nExpert - Facial expressions with subtle emotions\r\n‚Ä¢ Training - The practice session before the games may be disabled to increase difficulty.\r\n‚Ä¢ Group Size - Choose from a group size for the game phase depending on the child's ability level. Group size can be 2 or 4 for Find It! and group size can be 2, 4, or 6 for Name It!\r\n‚Ä¢ Languages - Choose from English and Spanish.\r\n\r\nFor parents, educators, and therapists:\r\n‚Ä¢ Profiles per child - More than one child can play the game and all data is stored under each child's name.\r\n‚Ä¢ Track data and statistics - At the end of the game, a graph of the child's data is presented.

        "description": "‚ÄúLearn ABC, 123, Colors and Shapes ‚Äì Preschool Guide‚Äù is designed for a simple and easy way for children and toddlers to learn about the alphabet, numbers, colors and shapes. The app aims to have both children and toddlers have a fun and engaging experience while simultaneously learning the information being presented to them, for this to be possible the app teaches through interactive games that the child/toddler can play, these games can range from basic to intermediate difficulty levels to ensure each age range has their own challenge and skill to learn.\r\nThe app itself is presented in a colorful and fun way for it to appeal to the children/toddlers, keeping young ones engaged can be difficult if it isn‚Äôt going to grab their attention instantly which the app combats by having fun cartoon images and colorful backgrounds. This is also helped along with fun jolly music which plays during every game so the children will have both visual and sound attention grabs to ensure they are fully focused.\r\n\r\nAbout the game:\r\n\r\nThe app itself hosts multiple versions of games; this is for different subject matters the child/toddler may want to learn. An example of the game is the app will present the children with 3 phonics that all start with a certain letter in the alphabet, so an ant or apple, then at the bottom of the screen the whole alphabet is laid out and the child will have to pick the letter that is featured in each example. This is just one example of the apps many unique games, most follow the same sort of premise with different variations for different subjects.\r\nAs the games progress the higher the difficulty level will raise, this is to provide a challenge for the children and toddlers; the app will slowly start to present them with more obscure letters, items, colors and so on which creates an area for learning. If the toddler is having increased difficulty, then the parent can select easier game modes for them so they can still enjoy the benefits the app offers.\r\n\r\nBenefits for children:\r\n\r\nThe games that the children and toddlers can play offer numerous amounts of benefits for their young minds. The most obvious one being that they will be learning a new skill/s while enjoying a fun and engaging activity, studies show that a child learns the best when they are enjoying themselves in the process and the app offers both the fun and educational side for every user. \r\nAnother benefit of using this app is the child can be doing something called remote learning, this means they will be learning something away from the classroom; this not only allows them to learn much faster and more efficiently but also improves their relationship and ability to use technology, which is a fast growing skill the modern age. \r\nNot only this but the app can increase communication skills between the child/toddler and parent/s, using an educational app can allow for you to bond with your child by completing numerous amounts of tasks together, this has been proven to not only improve the bond between you and your child but to also boost your child‚Äôs self-esteem.\r\nFinally, another benefit that can really help boost your child‚Äôs overall learning capabilities is the idea of introducing a new learning method, although the app uses a simple base game it is still something new and engaging for your child to play around with and learn. New learning methods can really help young children see things from new perspectives and help them piece things together much easier than they would have before.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tActivities that will allow your child to learn ABC and 123\r\n‚Ä¢\tActivities that will allow your child to learn colors and shapes\r\n‚Ä¢\tFun and interactive games\r\n‚Ä¢\tBright and colorful screens to engage your child\r\n‚Ä¢\tFun and cheerful music to also help engage your child \r\n‚Ä¢\tCartoon graphics to be suitable for children\r\n‚Ä¢\tAll different types of game modes for each subject\r\n‚Ä¢\tIncreasing difficulty to help provide a challenge for the children\r\n‚Ä¢\tSupport for parents",

The app helps make it easier for families to care for a loved one ‚Äì no matter where they are.\r\n\r\nThe app helps a family detect if a loved one is struggling. For example, it tells you if they are becoming forgetful or not maintaining their regular daily routines, such as remembering to take medicine. And it tells you if their physical activity is decreasing. It‚Äôs important to detect a decrease in physical activity because if they don‚Äôt receive some additional help then they could be at an increased risk of having a fall or suffer with reduced independence.\r\n\r\nThe app is technically advanced and features multiple built-in phone sensors. These sensors can give a family an advance warning that a loved one is struggling and lets you respond to ensure they receive the care they need.\r\n\r\nA built-in motion sensor automatically lets the family know when (say) Grandmother moves or picks up her phone. In the morning it is reassuring to receive a message telling you your loved one has woken up at their regular time. And if you don‚Äôt get the message you know to call her and check everything is ok. \r\n\r\nThe app lets you setup daily recurring reminders for your loved one, for example, at 10:00 every morning your Grandfather‚Äôs phone has a notification to (say) reminder him to take medicine. And you receive a message when they do it. It helps you to see if a person is maintaining their regular daily routines.  You can set this up from your phone ‚Äì and select the reminders and tasks to appear on your loved ones phone. \r\n\r\nMobile phones and tablets offer many benefits but for some older adults they struggle to use them as part of their daily lives. Perhaps they forget to charge the battery or they don‚Äôt keep it close by for when they need it (the phone is left untouched and forgotten).  The app helps a family to support a loved one to establish and maintain a daily routine of having a phone charged and close by. The app tells you if your loved ones phone battery gets low and it tells you when they charge their phone ‚Äì so you can call and remind them if they forget to charge their phone.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed to help your elderly loved one with ‚Äòeveryday living‚Äô. The term ‚ÄòEveryday Living‚Äô is incredibly important and encompasses:  (i) remaining socially engaged; (ii) continuing with activities that give life meaning; (iii) contributing to family or community; (iv) not feeling ‚Äòburdensome‚Äô to their families; and (v) continuing the role as caregiver.\r\n\r\nThe app links phones together to create a safe private group that helps people share, care and keeps people in touch.  The apps built-in sensors mean an elderly relative receives a continuous stream of family news feed events from their children and grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nPlease ask all your family to download the app and join your private group.\r\n\r\nWe hope you find the app useful.

        "descriptionHTML": "The NCLEX-PN¬Æ exam is given to all candidates wishing to practice practical or vocational nursing in the United States. The test itself is computer-adaptive, meaning it increases and decreases in difficulty until it assesses your level of competence. You will receive a minimum of 85 questions and a maximum of 205. Twenty-five of the questions you take are considered ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù and will not count for or against your score.<br>The NCLEX-PN¬Æ exam is organized around the concept of ‚Äúclient needs.‚Äù There are four major categories, two of which are further subdivided. The categories and the percentage of the test they make up are as follows:<br>Safe and Effective Care Environment<br>‚Ä¢\tCoordinated Care (18%‚Äì24%)<br>‚Ä¢\tSafety and Infection Control (10%‚Äì16%)<br>Health Promotion and Maintenance (6%‚Äì12%)<br>Psychosocial Integrity (9%-15%)<br>Physiological Integrity<br>‚Ä¢\tBasic Care and Comfort (7%‚Äì13%)<br>‚Ä¢\tPharmacological Therapies (10%‚Äì16%)<br>‚Ä¢\tReduction of Risk Potential (9-15%)<br>‚Ä¢\tPhysiological Adaption (7%‚Äì13%)<br>The actual test does not divide the questions into topic areas, though. All areas are mixed into the entire test.<br>Is the NCLEX-PN¬Æ exam standing in the way of the nursing job of your dreams? Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre here to help! Our free Practice Test for the NCLEX-PN¬Æ exam will help you prepare for the types of questions you‚Äôll encounter on the actual test, so you‚Äôll feel more prepared when it‚Äôs time to tackle the real thing.

            "Biggest disappointed, unfortunately. Been using it for years. I was a huge fan and recommended it all of my classes, each and every year. Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

If your child is 5-6-7 years old, already knows numbers and letters, pre-school and kindergarten are over, don't worry! The app can still come in handy!

Please refund my payment as I cancelled within the day. Thanks.",

        "description": "Talk To Me 100¬Æ Lite (free version) is a powerful, engaging tool for children who are learning to talk, or who have difficulty mastering verbal expression. An interactive teaching device, Talk To Me 100¬Æ allows the child - by pressing buttons - to see words, hear words, understand their meaning and experience the joy of communication. Using the pinch and swipe gestures, the board can be expanded and moved on the tablet as needed. This Free Version offers 9 of the most frequently used symbols and sounds. The full version is priced at $5.99 and offers 100 symbols and corresponding sounds.\r\n\r\nThe Talk To Me 100¬Æ Android App was developed by a Speech and Language Pathologist as a way to facilitate error-less communication (in which the learner never fails, but is supported in all communication attempts) to teach beginning language skills.\r\n\r\nThis new voice output app helps parents, teachers and therapists jump-start verbal expression for children who are struggling to communicate.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ allows the learner to control their environment, and to signal the point of readiness to communicate. Talk To Me 100¬Æ also provides immediate and consistent feedback, allows for practice and repetition of 100 frequently used words throughout daily activities, provides fun and enjoyment and lets the learner become accustomed to touch screen use.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ is designed to provide communication partners with 100 words organized in a predictable format to use in an unlimited choice of daily activities. Sydspeak created this app for children with autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, speech and language disorders and other special needs. Talk To Me 100¬Æ provides communication partners with a core vocabulary to begin verbal expression for all functions of language: imitate, comment, answer, question, describe, retell, accept, reject, repeat, command, request, explain, persuade, maintain social relationship and influence.\r\n\r\nThe adult communication partner models one or more words by selecting the buttons and using their natural voice to speak the same words whether you are getting ready for school, eating dinner, reading or playing outside; opportunities for verbal interaction are unlimited.\r\n\r\nTalk To Me 100¬Æ provides a beginning augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) solution for people who have difficulty speaking. Once the learner begins to combine 2-3 words spontaneously to communicate a new or novel thought, they are well on their way to using more than 100 words, either using natural voice or using a more expanded and dynamic AAC device.\r\n\r\nThis Android app is a digital replica and companion to the original ‚Äúchild friendly‚Äù Talk To Me 100¬Æ available at www.sydspeak.com. Priced at $59, this tablet is similar in size and comes in a durable plastic case with 3AAA batteries. Research shows that when each communication partner uses their own personal voice output device, language acquisition is more efficient. For some children, a predictable pattern of images on a computer screen using the same child‚Äôs voice has more impact than pictures on paper with changing adult verbal interactions. For the first time, we now have a powerful communication system where both partners can have their own affordable and effective language device with the same voice and symbols.\r\n\r\nThe free version offers a sample of beginning language learning.\r\n\r\nI recently evaluated a 3 year old child who was nonverbal. His parents said he only spoke 2 words: ‚Äúmama‚Äù and ‚Äúbye‚Äù. When presented with the Talk To Me 100¬Æ, he began exploring the board, pressing the symbols and listening to the words. I began using my version on the tablet, and he immediately began imitating my words by pressing the symbols on his device. What sometimes takes months of therapy to achieve, he was imitating words within a few minutes!!!",

I also like the notes section that allows me to write my thoughts as well as share with others. And also using the same application on other devices helps to carry on from where I left. Awesome work from all those involved. May Maharaj provide you with more strength and blessings to carry on such a wonderful seva.",

It made me label the external obliques as tranverse abdoninus. Then it made me label rectus abdominus as obliques. Also, the anatomy labeling as you can see, isn't that in depth. For the skin it has you labeling the dermis, epidermis, and hypodermis. When there are more structures that one could put in. btw is 5 bucks",

            "It's a shame that this game doesn't give you the coins you win. Played the daily challenge for 30 days and won the 200 coins, yet I didn't get them. Tried to contact them but the have no direct message. There is no use playing if you're going to cheat me out of the winnings. Also need to work on the words. There have been many words that you say no that are.....",
            "Great game which is addictive, I play this all the time because it is simple yet fun. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because there is one improvement which would be good to see in this game; and that would be an option to change colours of the block and background. Having played the game more 100s of times, seeing the same colours does make it dull. If this small update was implemented, it would make a huge difference.",
            "I am giving this a low rating because of all the ads and the fact that you can get rid of them for 4 bucks but thats just for 30 days. Seriously???? Also the landscape never changes even though in the ad it showed green grass which looked cool. Shame on you devs. Where are the levels in the pictures and trailer? It's a great game but it's the same thing over amd over again.",
            "Not what was advertised when It was an ad, I saw ad and was like woah that looks like a fun little game so I downloaded quickly without investigating, only to find this completely different game so for that I give a 1star. But it's a fun game so 5 star. DO NOT LIKE BEING TRICKED HOWEVER. Shame on you if you're in control of false advertising. But a fun game so I'm conflicted.",
            "The music is peace allowing you to think ,no time presure,which allows you to relax,and the background pic is beautiful. No ads intrupt while your trying to think.So if you like block puzzles I highly recommed trying this one."

        "description": "Visual Schedules And Social Stories is a visual support app focusing on  using social stories and visual schedules to improve socially appropriate behaviors in children with autism. It's a virtual visual support app to assist children with autism and communication challenges at home, school and the community. The app replaces the traditional visual supports that can be cumbersome, time consuming, costly to create and limited in function.\r\n\r\nChildren with Autism Spectrum Disorder may have difficulty with expressive language or social skills. Social Stories are a tool that teachers and parents use to teach children with autism the appropriate way to act in a social situation. While Visual Schedules helps children with autism to have a daily routine and schedule for different tasks. They also like to know what to expect during the day. Visual schedules use pictures to show students which activities they will be doing that day.\r\nThey also help students stay on-task by showing them what work they need to do before they can participate in an activity they enjoy! \r\nMaking Social Stories and Visual Schedules takes a lot of time and energy for teachers and parents who are already very busy. The time spent on laminating, gluing, and printing could be better used teaching children on how to use these great tools. And here is where Visual Schedules And Social Stories app comes in.

        "descriptionHTML": "Visual Schedules And Social Stories is a visual support app focusing on  using social stories and visual schedules to improve socially appropriate behaviors in children with autism. It&#39;s a virtual visual support app to assist children with autism and communication challenges at home, school and the community. The app replaces the traditional visual supports that can be cumbersome, time consuming, costly to create and limited in function.<br><br>Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder may have difficulty with expressive language or social skills. Social Stories are a tool that teachers and parents use to teach children with autism the appropriate way to act in a social situation. While Visual Schedules helps children with autism to have a daily routine and schedule for different tasks. They also like to know what to expect during the day. Visual schedules use pictures to show students which activities they will be doing that day.<br>They also help students stay on-task by showing them what work they need to do before they can participate in an activity they enjoy! <br>Making Social Stories and Visual Schedules takes a lot of time and energy for teachers and parents who are already very busy. The time spent on laminating, gluing, and printing could be better used teaching children on how to use these great tools. And here is where Visual Schedules And Social Stories app comes in. Along with having multiple wonderful built-in Visual Schedules and Social Stories, the app also helps parents and teachers to create their own unlimited personal schedules and stories about new events or skills they are trying to teach.

            "Bought it and after 15mins with the full version deleted and refund requested. I attempted to make my own schedule using photos I took myself while adding steps. Most wouldn't save :( Next I tried to change an image using one of the stock images, saved. That one kept reverting also. Recorded audio, but where does that play? Lastly, I couldn't rearrange the order of the steps for a schedule. 15 mins of trying and failing I realized I can probably do the same thing with PowerPoint.",
            "This app has potential. It is limited. Parents need access to pictures of a variety of individual task. You can upload your own picture which for some tasks like putting on shoes a child would recognize and maybe even relate better, howerever having the caricatures shoes would be more universally effective. If there were options and acess to unlimited art (different foods, clothes, places) for the variety of topics autism has. I would pay for it in a heartbeat. It has potential.",
            "Great at making visual social stories, adding photos and voice cues. Downfall is that you cant login and share your stories on multiple devices. I have installed on my phone for on the go use, and on my sons tablet for home use, but have to create stories twice as they dont sync together.",
            "Give 0 stars, limited to edit, useless for free version since not much you can do, good concept but since you very limited on fixing a schedule wouldn't even be worth a buy. Pretty much a waste of time and effort, practically useless, do yourself and download a diffrent app, can find better ones for free.",
            "Not happy with this app at all very limited even on the full version would not recommend requested a refund to the app developer waiting for a response"

            "Loved the app. I can see the articles in this app slowly impacting my daily routine. It's keeping me motivated. It's helping me learn things. I feel like reading a good book after just a small article. Thing to improve: it suggests me a good article in the notification and when I click it nothing happens. The notification just disappears.",
            "This is an amazing app!!!!I am writing my review after one month of using it and the app gives me some inspirational ideas and strategies to make my lifestyle better in a progressive manner.However, I am giving 4 stars because of the bugs.When I open the app,it freezes for a few minutes and works.I hope it can be rectified on upcoming updates. EDIT : Thanks for the response from the team! It just works fine now . Reinstall fixed the bugs. I already had the latest 4.3.0 and it had bugs somehow..",
            "Instead of swiping to read the next article, may I suggest putting an icon that we can tap on to go to the next article instead of swiping? when scrolling on the current article that I'm reading, I accidentally scroll too far to the left/right and it goes to the next article and when I go back, it didn't even refresh to where I left off! I love this app, I prefer it more than social media, but it's so annoying when I accidentally swipe on the next article and have to go back & scroll down again!",
            "In a world that seems to be a raging dumpster fire, and everything in social media and news pointing to how bad things are getting... This app is a breath of fresh air. It offers simple, memorable morsels of wisdom. Easily consumable. It is so important to focus on what we can control---ourselves. Working on bettering ourselves, our mindsets, and expanding our horizons is the way we change the world. I am adding this app to my home screen and making a commitment to read articles daily. Great app",
            "This is just so worth it. If I were to recommend something that is worth accessing, well this is pretty much on my top list of reads. I'm loving this, the settings, the articles in it and the concepts of developing such an app was so just so impressive. Hats off to the developers and creators."

            "Setting up medications is REALLY confusing. There are dozens of formulations that are in the list, but their missing Amphetamine salts, which, in my experience, is a common label for generics. That pretty much stopped me there. A quick look at the other 'tools' and, well, not very descriptive. Overall, this app strikes me as an 'everything for everyone'. I don't know where they got their knowledge base data, but they need to do more research. Some treatment providers claim to treat adult ADHD, but will only use dosages appropriate for children and adolescents and stop there, in spite of guidelines for adults being available. More often than not, adults are undertreated. This app would just muddy up treatment.",

            "It's a good vocab app. I especially like it since it brings together high-frequency words of different words. However, I couldn't find the quiz questions impressive. They needs to customise the quiz answer options with more variety and words with nearby but confusing meanings.",
            "1. Lists of words are good. 2. People suggest quite good mnemonics to remember words. 3. Recommendation to developers: Add category of words whether it is noun, adjective, verb or adverb (it will help readers using word in a sentence)",
            "It's a good app. Everything is perfect. But only a thing is missing. There should be parts of speech beside every word. It'd be more helpful if we are able to know the parts of speech of the word.",
            "Wonderful app. However, if I search a word, I don't understand under which button the word belongs to. For an example, I searched for ' surreptitiously ' and I found it but I don't where it belongs. Whether, magoosh 1000 or Barron's 333. I can swipe right and left and there are so many words. But the minute I exit, I can't find them. It is not possible to find the word before going through all the available options. Which is quite demanding... Nevertheless, it is an absolute gem of an app.",
            "A very good and interesting app for GRE. However I don't understand what you mean by 'high frequency' word 'medium frequency' or 'low frequency '. Are you saying how they appear often on GRE?"

            "This app is could be a great learning tool for kids, but unfortunately it punishes them for getting 5 notes wrong, and makes them wait 8 hours to have another try (or pay money). I wanted to have them try and see if they stuck with it enough for it to be worth paying for the better version of the app, but my kids got too frustrated with the \"come back in 8 hours\" message after 5 mistakes and they don't want to play it anymore. It's disappointing, because I have learned pretty quickly from it.",
            "I'm a teacher looking for a app for students. I'm also a programmer, but was hoping not to have to program a basic music learning tool. This game has kid friendly graphics, but it's absurd to make a kid do each level 3 times, which is stressful, but it's also not how that gameplay function is used. If the game were balanced for learning, it would be great, but it's garbage otherwise. 1 star bc kids will hate it.",
            "This has been a wonderful help in my relearning the scales and notes!! I would recommend this to everyone.",
            "The app concept is sound, but the selection of note interface needs more room or some visual improvement. Additionally, from what I can tell initially, the stems on the staff are always up, which makes this game not only more difficult than it should be, but fails to incorporate a very significant aspect of learning to associate (or reproduce) notation correctly.",
            "This is a very nice way for the kids to practice their notes. I do wish i could choose which notes they start with and practice. They start at the bottom of base cleft when all beginner piano books teach them from middle c... It was definitely worth the two dollars to buy the whole game so they can practice all the notes."

However, currently there's no way to begin a quiz from level 1 again if I've already progressed to a higher level but want to test myself again on the previous levels. Right now, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to achieve this. Hope you'll add a feature to reset the quiz so you can again start from level 1 whenever you want.",
            "Amazing app to learn kannada. Insted of saying kannada kalasi to non kanadiga, people should forward this app link. Easy to learn from Hindi. Easy interface, nice thought on video integration. One suggestion of adding more interesting video clips with subtitle. Hoping, my next comment will be in Kannada itself üòä",

            "I downloaded Educational Games. Word Search in addition to other phonics and kindergarten games to test out. There are multiple language settings so this makes a great app for all ages! The apps default was not in english, but is easily changed. I would rate it 5 stars if there were a easy 'purchase full app' option. 10000 credits purchase all but one word search category...English Clothing category is misspelled with a V.",
            "On tablet, I tried to remove the ads and buying the game then instead it foced me to accept some wired terms which took me to some page that foces me to buy some commercial items. I would recommenc any parents who got the same experience trying to buy this app to raise their voice. scam scam this is!!! Check Camy Rose comments. On mobile, the first time I was allowed to buy the app, then when I downloaded again on the same mobile and now I have to ho over the same issues as the tablet.",
            "I like it just a bit it gives me a hard time to look at words and i don't pay attention to the help kn it i love it so much abd that was the end of the day if im playing so hard and tough though i thought it was easy but super hard its silly it makes no sense im not surprised that it doesn't look right to me which is hard SO im not going to care much about just this for now the only thing i hate is the hints",
            "It loaded in Spanish. No other option to switch to english.",
            "to many double ads, after every leavel too ads come and the x or close part sometime doesnt let you exit the ad or it will take you to download that other ad or app. its a really cute fun kids game. easy for my kids to play but the ads are to much of a pain,"

            "I like the app because it is easy to use with lots of common sentences that you can use in daily life unlike other apps that only teach you travel words. The reason i gave 3 stars instead of 5 is because the translations are not accurate. Yes, they are rough translations and near it's meaning but I suggest that you should provode the exact word for word translation like what Duolingo did in their app. It helps in making sense which is which word.",
            "Contains many features one would normally pay for. A superior app as it focuses on sentences and not individual words, uses color to inform the reader of the proper tone, and below the practice sentence shows the short meaning of each individual word. My favorite sentence: \"‡∏Å‡∏¥‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏Å‡πà‡∏≤‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏®‡∏±‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏π‡πà‡∏ö‡∏ô‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏°‡πâ.\" 555",

But I am giving 4 starts because for some problem statements....there is no explanation...so it's my request to developer to keep explanation of all the problems wherever possible. All must download this app.......hope this review helps ...thanks once again ......and salute to your tallentüôè",
            "Amazing and outstanding app for the C programs..It covers almost all the basics and advance level of programoing codes which gives a better way to read, understand and analyse the code...really impressed...5 out of 5üòäüòä",
            "As it is very very very useful app for me as it has separate sections and different way of display of all programs in their own directory ..as more programs are available",
            "Really helpful . Explanation of some of the programs are missing , still one of the best apps.",
            "I use this app to study C and really like the structure, for what it's worth, but it white screens far too often, forcing me to close and reopen the app. This happens after a) leaving the app to search for a more in depth example (say, pointers) or b) after viewing a few examples in the app. I get it's a free app, but it barely works for 10min without breaking and it's just textual examples... Fix and I'll update my rating."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "It's a great app as always. BUT for those who wanna update it to the latest version, DON'T DO IT. The latest system don't allow us to buy other species without paying for premium. Unlocking different type of trees is what keep motivating us to focus on the priorities. Without premium, there left only few typical trees in the store. As a student who's still financially independent like many others, I try not to spend any coins or cash on any apps no matter the price. I wish u can change it back.",
            "Amazing app. Got me to focus during a very difficult time, and has continued to do so ever since. Well worth the cheap price for premium, but completely usable without buying. Brilliant support: Some of my data went missing at one point, and I had a friendly reply and full data restoration within 3 days. Suggestion: Being able to give a single tree multiple labels would be even better.",
            "Simple, cool app. Nice visualization for staying on task for long projects. It's weird that the friends feature is only for premium users. I feel like giving that option to free users would encourage much more people to start using the app, considering how friends get people invested in competitions like this, but aside from that it's worth the download at least. That missing feature is the only immediate reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars",
            "Someone suggested the app the me and I recently started using it. I LOVE the concept and it's super nice to be able to be motivated to stay focused. However what makes me quite sad is not that I cannot buy different species of trees, it's more that without premium, we can't help to plant real trees... I wish they would allow all user the be able to plan real trees, even if we have to watch an ad for every tree, I think it would be worth it."

            "Newest release is ad heavy! Before a game, after a game and now on the score page. Use to have a good ad to game ratio with only 1 add per game. And they dont prove their ads. I've had several that the only way to end them was to switch to another app. Oh well, another game to be removed because someone got greedy. Game play and options are outstanding and if the ads weren't so many I'd still play it.",
            "Best ever Sudoku game I've found! Very intelligent game, specifically that I often miss the square I was aiming for, and this game is smart enough to not count that as a mistake, especially on a bad day. It includes fast games, multiple levels of difficulty, and even a giant puzzle with 16 characters, plus colour schemes for comfort and a variety of ways to input data. I doubt I'll ever look for a different Sudoku game, this offers absolutely everything I could think of!",
            "This app used to be ok. Now it acts like a virus. Starts playing multiple ads by itself...no way to stop that...seems a dangerous app to have. Please do not install it. Thanks for responding. Ads between games is fine. After I click on skip/cross, some other ad starts playing in background while the game is displayed on screen. Happens even while using other apps- if I kill sudoku app the background ad stops. After I uninstalled your app I did not face this problem. Please check.",
            "Good game, but too many adverts, which I accept pay for the game. Some of the adverts go on too long until you can close them, draining the battery of the phone, and there have been a couple where I have had to completely close the game to get past the advert. Apparently all of the adverts are supposed to have the option to close after the first 5 seconds or so. This is the case the majority of the time, but not always.",
            "Excellent interface - great notes function; handy way of removing numbers once you've placed all nine (one should remember, but often does not üòä); error check (bit cheaty, but. ..); clear and easy to see. Don't like the ads, so I'd actually buy this (say a ¬£iver) and give it a 5 star. Thank you."

            "6 sample levels are fine. No intrusive ads. Would be good for younger children starting clock, but need counting to 60 skills.",
            "No idea why this is so highly rated. It's not easy to use or understand. You have to complete early stages first which is annoying if your child has already learned these at school, the clock doesn't have numbers on it, which my child found confusing.",
            "A bit robotic and you can only do the first 6 levels before you have to get the full app."
