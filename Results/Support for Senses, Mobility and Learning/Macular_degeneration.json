The developer in everyday retina practice has found that patients often forget, misplace or lose at home the amsler grid charts given to them by his office.\r\n   Thus specifically this app is the 1st ophthalmology app for the AMD patient designed with the following integrated features:\r\n       • an Amsler grid which the user can schedule daily or weekly alerts.\r\n       • education and information data to patients about AMD.\r\n       • design for patients and user focus in mind rather than a resource for the healthcare professional/student/resident who need more of a reference utility.\r\n       • protects patient privacy by not allowing the upload of a patient's personal daily amsler grid recording.\r\n   \r\n   For more information on the app please visit www.AMDeye.com and for more information on the retina office of Dr. Sastry please visit www.bethesdaretina.com.",

        "description": "This eye test is designed to monitor a person's central visual field in the most pleasant, intuitive and stress-free way for FREE.\r\n\r\nVision test is useful for:\r\n- Patients with macular degeneration (usually instructed to monitor their vision daily)\r\n- House visits\r\n- Household tests for adults who have doubts if a doctor's visit is required\r\n- Nursing homes\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Random test charts to eliminate boring and repeating experiences;\r\n- Voice controls to help you navigate easier;\r\n- Smooth and intuitive interface with animations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis eye examination is of particular interest to reveal age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which mostly affects adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment for adults over 50 years. Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to pass this test a couple of times each year no matter what your age is.\r\n\r\nThe amsler grid used in this examination is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula (e.g. macular degeneration, Epiretinal membrane), as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain. A particular problem is the age-related macular degeneration.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is made with the best of intentions. The intuitive and flawless design allows you to navigate easily through the application. The voice guidance is provided during the test so that you don't need to move your mobile device near or far to read the instructions but instead you can hear the nice voice guiding you through different steps and actions. The voice can easily be muted and unmuted.\r\n\r\nIn the test, you will be given a small dot in the center of the grid. One should identify if any of the straight lines are wavy, missing or have other disorder. At the end of the test results will show whether the person has problems in central visual field or not for each eye separately.\r\n\r\nMore details about central visual field, macular degeneration, retina, eye examination tests and trainings as well as other eye related topics can be found in our news.eyeexamtest.com blog.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is continuously under improvement so your feedback is appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\n- Take the most comfortable position to relax.\r\n- Have a mild nature light and no glare on the phone screen.\r\n- Wear your contacts or glasses if you normally do.\r\n- Place your phone approx. 50 cm/20 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Cover one eye at a time with your hand.\r\n- Stare at the dot in the center. Do not let your eye drift from the center dot.\r\n- Try to identify if any of the straight lines appear wavy or bent,\r\n- Any of the boxes differ in size or shape from the others, or\r\n- Any of the lines are missing, blurry or discolored.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Languages:\r\n\r\n- English\r\n- Russian\r\n\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO:\r\nWe highly recommend using our Eye Care Plus that allows to pass a more detailed eye examination as well as train your eye muscles for better vision.\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyeexamtest.eyecareplus\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nThis application is not intended to replace optician's regular full examination.

            "I don't like the app in terms of statistics. It asks to little questions, so results every time very different. Also it asks the same order of symbols for both eyes. So if your left eye is better, you can remember the sequence first, then use you memory to see better same characters for right eye. Also it gives very different scores for different test. Overall considering so many design flows I do not recommend using this app at all.",
            "I feel as if i see much more than test indicates. I can see long distances clearly. I had used my eye drops a few minues prior to the first test. Should i have put on my readers? I would like to communicate with someone to make sure i did the test right.",
            "It described my vision perfectly I was very satisfied with this it is accurate it blew me away that it was so! And I'm 65 years old. Would recommend!",
            "I like this app! it's not a certified doctor but I appreciate that I have at least the knowledge that I need to keep my Eye appointments. The test and instruction is pretty easy to understand. Pretty easy to understand the instructions.",
            "Fairly accurate except the test to see if your glasses are right for you. It said my glasses were not right for me. I tried the regular test with glasses on and had 100% vision in both eyes which tell me me my glasses are the right strength. Also the test to see if you have a stigmatism isn't right. It said I have a stigmatism in both eyes and my Son got the same result when he has 20/10 vision which is even better than 20/20 vision!"

I generally find myself using the tap-to-focus, pause and then zoom/pan on the still image (and can then still apply say a black-on-white filter). Well thought out but so simple interface and the included User Manual is also very clear and concise. Credit and thanks to the developer!",
            "Good apk.. But it would be much better if you add an onscreen magnifier feature. Like zooming text and images on the phone. That feature will be so helpful. Because not only the things around us, but we can also magnify images and text on our phone. But thanks , it is a nice app",

            "great app. installed on older Asus tablet snd S8 phone, have recommended to several other folks with various vision imoairments, used wigh Samsung Dex as a portable magnifier in my workshop usung HDMI to alarge screen tv, works great with the S8 and with the light enabled, asus tablet has no light so low or no light on the rablet is grainy but still amazingly useful, Props to the developer and highly recommend. no nag no ads just works.",
            "Works perfectly - allows me to read things I'd never have a chance of doing otherwise. The option to pause works well. The colour filters allow me to invert the colours, so those tricky things on a white background are suddenly clear and easy to read. Once I figured out to touch the screen to focus, the picture is clear. The controls are nice and easy to use. Really useful app."

Shows notification bar when different eye protection modes are activated. It is not intrusive, very easy to turn on/off or snooze the protection for couple of hours. Optimized to use very little of your phone battery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proven that cold blue light is dangerous for eyes and may even be a root cause of cataract or retina damage after couple of years.

            "This application has been nearly perfect for the year I've been using it, reduces blue light, dims the screen, can set intensity, and lots more. But ever since 10/5/20 the app stopped reducing blue light and the screen's brightness, instead it changes it the the color of the screen to a bright orange, yellow, or white light. Not sure why this just started happening but the app isn't usable anymore and has killed the app experience for me, hope this is fixed soon. Update; seems like it was fixed.",
            "My reading mode doesn't function anymore. The one that is in the phone itself. So I downloaded this app . It is wonderful . I have spectacles so this helps to reduce eye strain. You can adjust the intensity . Different lights available. Like night , fluorescent , dawn etc It's an amazing app. Free of cost too.",
            "This is the app that I can't uninstall no matter how full my storage is already. I really need it and it's easy to use and really functional. It makes my eyes better at night. I always maximize its screen dim. I love this so much. My only suggestion is that you should cover and make the app functional on the notif and status bar because when I turn the wifi on and off it gets really bright.",
            "First and only app I (have) downloaded. Only intention was to schedule a nightly set time that phone \"dims\" and reduces Blue Light. It has unequivocally done that both on a severely aging Samsung 5 and again on newly purchased Pixel4. Granted, nothing to compare it to, but with it hitting my marks with a user friendly interface, I initially programmed my nightly slider filter options and scheduled start/finish times in one minute or less as a 1st time user. Routine adjustments required. 5 stars",
            "This app allows you to not only turn down the blue light but also the screen light. My phones screen light is set to the lowest option and at night in bed it is still too bright. With this app I can turn it all down. I turn it down to an almost visible darkness which causes me to squint to see and lulls me to sleep sooner. It also has the option to pause the dimming to take a Screencast which my other app wouldn't, causing the picture to be super dark."

There are two types of macular degeneration: atrophic (\"dry\") and exudative (\"wet\"). As people age, parts of the retina may deteriorate.\r\nAlthough the cause of this condition is not clear, possible causes and risk factors may include: lack of certain vitamins and minerals, breakdown in circulation to the retina, untreated health conditions such as high blood pressure, excessive exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun, heredity, and smoking.\r\nThe eye care doctor can diagnose macular degeneration during a comprehensive eye examination. Ophthalmoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to view the back of the eye, including the macula. If macular degeneration is suspected, a fluorescein angiogram may be performed. In this procedure, dye is injected into the arm and travels to the eye. Damaged areas become highlighted to help determine which type of macular degeneration is present, wet or dry.\r\n\r\n- Retinitis Pigments -\r\nRetinitis pigmentosa is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the retina. RP causes the breakdown of photoreceptor cells and the patient experience progressive vision loss.\r\nThe first signs of retinitis pigmentosa in affected children are identifiable by a doctor as early as age 10. In most cases, the disorder is linked to a recessive gene, a gene that must be inherited from both parents in order to cause the disease. But dominant genes and genes on the X chromosome also have been linked to retinitis pigmentosa. In these cases, only one parent has passed the disease gene. In some cases, a new mutation causes the disease to occur.\r\n\r\n- Cataract -\r\nA cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye leading to a decrease in vision. They may affect one or both eyes and often develop slowly over time.\r\nCataracts are commonly appearing while aging. They may also occur due to trauma or radiation exposure. In some cases they also can be present from birth or occur following eye surgery. Risk factors are diabetes, smoking, extensive exposure to sunlight, and alcohol. \r\nEither clumps of protein or yellow-brown pigment may be deposited in the lens reducing the transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye.\r\n\r\n- Glaucoma -\r\nGlaucoma is the name of group of several diseases that damage the eye’s optic nerve and can result in vision loss and blindness. However, with early detection and treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss.",

I spent a very long time testing many. Even asking Google about the permissions issue says the same thing, so i just remove and put it back app bcoz its the easiest way & this is the best, nicest and basic one of all imo.",

Use night light anti glare to relieve eye strain and protect eyes from bluelight flux that can disrupt circadian rhythm, cause insomnia and restlessness, chronic migraine, sleepless chronic headache, glaucoma and cataract.\r\n\r\n❓ What is blue light?\r\n\r\nIt's part of a natural light spectrum, which disturbs the circadian rhythm and causes sleeplessness, headache and bad eye health. Unlike red light night shade, screen light bluelight blocks the secretion of melatonin, sleep hormone, and causes restlessness. Retinal neurons are in danger if night filter anti glare is not used after twilight for eye care.\r\n\r\n😕 The negative effects of blue light flux are:\r\n\r\n• Eye strain, tired eyes and bad eye health\r\n• Higher risk of glaucoma, and cataract\r\n• Phase shifting of the circadian rhythm, restlessness, and suppression of melatonin\r\n• Chronic migraine pain and activation of the trigeminal nerve\r\n• Chronic headache\r\n• Insomnia, sleepless night time and sleeplessness\r\n\r\nNight Shift - Blue Light Filter for Migraine as your anti glare night screen and warmlight night mode helps you by relieving eye strain and chronic headache during night reading. Its red light night shade is best for eye care against light blue rays from\r\nscreen light that cause glaucoma, melatonin deficiency, and sleepless night time - insomnia.

It's best for good eye health and chronic headache relief during night reading because it gives a night shade warmlight in form of a night light.\r\n\r\n🌡 Temperature customization - Use \"Temperature\" palette to set a warmlight (night mode) or cooler tint to your blue light filter. Twilight looking red light colors are recommended as a bluelight flux filter for tired eyes and used as a night shift for eye strain, chronic migraine relief, and sleepless restlessness.\r\n\r\n🌈 Color customization - Use \"Color\" palette to adjust the color tint, intensity and dim for your night screen. Night filter provides eye care and relief from migraine pain caused by screen light.\r\n\r\n📊 RGB customization - Use \"RGB\" to fine-tune your natural light night reading filter. \"R\" - red light, \"G\" - green, \"B\" - light blue. Night light rests tired eyes with night shade and increase melatonin and prevent glaucoma.\r\n\r\n⏰ Automatic filter schedule - Choose the times in which the anti glare night mode will shift on and off to improve eye health. Ensure that blue light filter is always turned on after twilight to prevent cataract and fight insomnia and restlessness.\r\n\r\n🔋 Reduce power usage - Bluelight flux night shift reduces the night screen power usage.

        "comments": [
            "I can definitely see the difference in tint of my screen when the filter is on and I like the notification bar widget that lets you control whether the filter is active with a single tap. It also only requires two permissions to draw over other apps and the OS to keep the whole screen changed and it's easy to schedule it to turn on. Although, the filter stops working after awhile and I'm not even sure if the schedule works or not.",
            "Easy to use and toggle. Unlike other apps I've tried, it has the option to keep the on and off option at the top of the notification area so it is always accessible. I also like that it supports more than one intensity of overlay; having options is much nicer than not having options.",
            "Was the best night light filter out there but since I updated to Android 11 it bugs every time I watch a video on full-screen (the filter only covers a square in the center of the screen while two big sides of the screen so not have the filter). Other than that it works well. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars. Also, don't push premium on me every time I turn on the app, allow users to choose \"no, thank you\" instead of \"later\".",
            "Honestly, this is really a good app which helps us prevent the exposure of blue light of the screen for better eye health. But, sometimes all of sudden it stops working, especially when I open some apps like sticky notes, YouTube, VPN, etc, so I have to open this app and turn it on again. Rather inconvenience sometimes. I hope there will be some improvement about it. Thanks in advance :)",
            "Some bugs, like occasional it stops working, and when setting up a new filter it will revert to full brightness during the set up, but potentially this could be one of the best blue filter programs I've tried. I have light or medium on during the day and dark at night. It would be nice to be able to set up a schedule for this. You can set up your own filters too, or adjust the pre-sets to get it how you want it."

Multibit is like mVT, but developed by Swedish researchers. mVT should be available to patients w/o prescription and give feedback directly to them!",
            "Instead of helping people they decided to make this test prescription only. For no reason at all, just to make it unavailable for the majority of people living on this planet in many countries, having macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. I wish many people give further negative reviews until they change their policy, to the benefit of sick people and to the benefit of themselves earning money.",

Find out if you are at higher risk for eye diseases.\r\nBe aware of your family's health history. Do you or any of your family suffer from diabetes or have a history of high blood pressure? Are you over age 60? Any of these traits increase your risk for sight-threatening eye diseases.\r\n\r\n2. Have regular physical exams to check for diabetes and high blood pressure.\r\nIf left untreated, these diseases can cause eye problems. In particular, diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to vision loss from diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and eye strokes.\r\n\r\n3. Look for warning signs of changes in your vision.\r\nIf you start noticing changes in your vision, see your eye doctor immediately. Some trouble signs to look for are double vision, hazy vision and difficulty seeing in low light conditions.\r\n\r\nOther signs and symptoms of potentially serious eye problems that warrant immediate attention include red eyes, frequent flashes of light, floaters, and eye pain and swelling.\r\n\r\n4. Exercise frequently.\r\nStudies suggest that regular exercise — such as brisk walking — can reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration by up to 70 percent.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nThis application is not intended to replace optician's regular full examination.

As principais causas de deficiência visual são erros refrativos não-corrigidos, catarata, degeneração macular relacionada à idade (DMRI), retinopatia diabética (RD), glaucoma. A perda da visão, em qualquer nível, leva a uma restrição no desempenho de atividades diárias, o que interfere na independência e autonomia do indivíduo e, por conseguinte, na sua qualidade de vida. O uso de auxílios ópticos, não-ópticos e adaptação do ambiente tem sido uma alternativa para melhorar o desempenho dos deficientes visuais em suas atividades.

Tap on the box that has an irregular color compared to the rest of the boxes.\r\n\r\n2. You have 15 seconds to decide on each grid.\r\n\r\n3. When you tap the wrong box you will lose 3 second.\r\n\r\nP.S. This game intended for entertainment purposes only and cannot be used for serious purposes.\r\n\r\nDID YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT COLOR VISION?\r\nHOW COLOR VISION WORKS\r\nHuman can distinguish colors when incoming light reacts with the cone cells in the retina of eye.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of cone cells. Based on how they respond to light of wavelengths you will perceive the three basic colors; red, green and blue. The rest of the colors are perceived as a result of your brain combining the different cone cells.\r\n\r\nOften it is claimed that women distinguish colors better than men. This is partly true since 2-3 % of women have also fourth type of cone cells instead of the normal three.\r\n\r\nThis is called tetrachromacy. A person like this can distuinguish up to 100 million different color tones.\r\n\r\nWHY ARE SOME PEOPLE COLOR BLIND\r\nSome people have color blindness. It is notably more common amongst the men: in research it's been found that 8 % of men are color blind as opposed to only 0,4 % of women.\r\n\r\ncolor blindness is caused by lack or defectiveness of cone cells in the retina of eye.\r\n\r\nFor a color blind person some colors look misleadingly similar. The most common form of color blindness is deuteranomaly, a difficulty to distinguish red and green.\r\n\r\nPlease notice that on this page you can't test color blindness, but your ability to differiate color tones.\r\n\r\nHOW ANIMALS SEE COLORS\r\nBirds are famous for their excellent eyesight. Their eyes can see even five basic colors and the number of different color combinations is vast.\r\n\r\nBees and many other insects can see ultraviolet light. That helps them to notice which plants are full of nectar and need pollination.\r\n\r\nIn most mammals' eyes there are less cone cells than in human's eyes which makes them see a smaller-scale color spectrum. Many mammals hunt at night when it's more important to distinguish shapes than colors.\r\n\r\nMarine fish register only blue and green light. In turn, fish living in lakes and rivers see shades of red.",

When you tap the wrong box you will lose 3 second.\r\n\r\nP.S. This game intended for entertainment purposes only and cannot be used for serious purposes.\r\n\r\nDID YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT COLOR VISION?\r\nHOW COLOR VISION WORKS\r\nHuman can distinguish colors when incoming light reacts with the cone cells in the retina of eye.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of cone cells. Based on how they respond to light of wavelengths you will perceive the three basic colors; red, green and blue. The rest of the colors are perceived as a result of your brain combining the different cone cells.\r\n\r\nOften it is claimed that women distinguish colors better than men. This is partly true since 2-3 % of women have also fourth type of cone cells instead of the normal three.\r\n\r\nThis is called tetrachromacy. A person like this can distuinguish up to 100 million different color tones.\r\n\r\nWHY ARE SOME PEOPLE COLOR BLIND\r\nSome people have color blindness. It is notably more common amongst the men: in research it's been found that 8 % of men are color blind as opposed to only 0,4 % of women.\r\n\r\ncolor blindness is caused by lack or defectiveness of cone cells in the retina of eye.\r\n\r\nFor a color blind person some colors look misleadingly similar. The most common form of color blindness is deuteranomaly, a difficulty to distinguish red and green.\r\n\r\nPlease notice that on this page you can't test color blindness, but your ability to differiate color tones.\r\n\r\nHOW ANIMALS SEE COLORS\r\nBirds are famous for their excellent eyesight. Their eyes can see even five basic colors and the number of different color combinations is vast.\r\n\r\nBees and many other insects can see ultraviolet light. That helps them to notice which plants are full of nectar and need pollination.\r\n\r\nIn most mammals' eyes there are less cone cells than in human's eyes which makes them see a smaller-scale color spectrum. Many mammals hunt at night when it's more important to distinguish shapes than colors.\r\n\r\nMarine fish register only blue and green light. In turn, fish living in lakes and rivers see shades of red.",

        "description": "Have trouble sleeping after a long time watching phone screen or eyes feel tired during night reading on the phone?\r\n\r\nThat because of the bluelight from the screen which can disturb your circadian rhythm and affects your sleep. However, with the help of the Moon - blue light filter, you can now have a more pleasant screen experience.\r\n\r\nMoon is highly recommended not only for adults but also small kids to ensure a 24-hour eye care. \r\n\r\nMoon - Blue light filter is used to reduce bluelight by adjusting the screen to natural color. Shifting your screen to night mode can relieve your eyes strain, and your eyes will feel at ease during night reading. Also, the blue light filter will protect your eyes and help you sleep easily.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n● Out of the box blue light filter profiles: Use one of 3 premade profiles to activate night mode and warm light (red light) for eye protection. Prevent macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataract with night filter during night reading.\r\n\r\n● Customable filter configurations: Create, customize and save your own filter profile to meet your needs or make a set of night filters, to protect eyes, fix circadian rhythm, sleeplessness, insomnia and lack of melatonin (trouble sleeping).\r\n\r\n● Save power: Moon reduces the screen power usage for the majority of devices. Use nightlight to reduce power usage while preventing chronic headache and repairing circadian rhythm.\r\n\r\n● Super easy to use: It is easy to turn on or off with just one tap. Moon also support notification access and widget!\r\n\r\n● Automatic filter schedule: Choose the times in which the night mode will shift on and off. Or even let the app determine at what time the sun sets based on your location, so it can turn on at night. You can ensure that blue light filter is always turned on during the midnight hours to ensure cataract eyecare and fight insomnia and restlessness.\r\n\r\nMoon needs some permissions to work:\r\n\r\n● 'Draw over other apps': to filter the blue light from you phone screen.\r\n\r\n● 'Modify system settings': to automatically lower the brightness when the filter is on.\r\n\r\n● 'Approximate location': to determine at what time the sun sets, so it can turn on at night.\r\n\r\n● 'Run at startup': to activate when your device is rebooted.",

        "description": "Diabetes is a widespread disease in the world, and up to 2014 around 422 million people worldwide have this disease. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease caused by the long-standing diabetes.\r\n\r\nBasically, DR affects blood vessels in the light-sensitive tissue (i.e retina). It becomes the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness for working-age adults in the world today, and around half of Americans with diabetes have this disease to some extent.\r\n\r\nA widely-known challenge for DR is that it has no early warning sign, even for diabetic macular edema. Thus, it is highly desired that DR can be detected in time. Unfortunately, in practice the current DR detection solution is nearly infeasible to meet this requirement.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the current solution requires a well-trained clinician and ophthalmologist to manually evaluate digital colour fundus photographs of retina, and DR is identified by locating the lesions associated with vascular abnormalities due to diabetes.\r\n\r\nThough this current solution is effective, it is time-consuming and highly relies on the expertise of well-trained practitioners. To solve this issue, in the past few years considerable efforts have been put on developing an automated solution for DR detection.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we have used a MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network model pre-trained on the ImageNet database, and fine-tuned it to work for this case.

The augmented reality overlay of visual impairments is a good concept but is poorly done in this app. Some warped cheap glasses from Walgreens could approximate the app overlay just as easily. The visual impairments overlay doesn't account for glare, low contrast, diminished peripheral field of view from old age or retinitis pigmentosa, or the general static in the gray scotomas. Many of these things occur simultaneously in a visually impaired person's field of view. The app shows only three visual impairments in a misleadingly simple manner in contrast.

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",
            "One of the Best scary apps in android..but u guys have to do some new challenges or new maps i mean bigger maps ..like if u got 20/20 money u go outside and u keep playing to get a car to run away or somthing like that"

Also it doesn't dim the buttons at the bottom of the screen. I've tried a few blue light apps and they all seem to have the same issues. For me the annoyance outweighs the benefits so im uninstalling it."

            "What could I do without this great app! Kudos to the developer! Thank you so much! Very simple, intuitive and the best app. Only thing that I would suggest changing is the possibility of setting regular ringtones, otherwise short one-time alarm tone sometimes is not enough. Good luck!",
            "This app is great to help keep one on schedule for using the right drops at the right time. Shows the color of the bottle cap of the drop to be used at each time and sounds a gentle chime as a reminder.",
            "Everything is nice. But we want some help in changing the alarm tone. In our case the tone seems like very short, it may not hear sometimes"

        "description": "Eyes feel tired during night reading on the phone? \r\n\r\nHave trouble in sleeping after long time watching phone screen?\r\n\r\nWhat is blue light?\r\n\r\nIt's part of a natural light spectrum, which disturbs the circadian rhythm and causes sleeplessness, headache and bad eye health. Unlike red light night shade, screen light bluelight blocks the secretion of melatonin, sleep hormone, and causes restlessness. Retinal neurons are in danger if night filter anti glare is not used after twilight for eye care.\r\n\r\nBlue light from your smartphone or tablet causes strain on your eyes and prevents you from falling asleep easily at night.\r\nThis app adjusts your screen color to reduce the blue light and helps your eyes to relax, making it easier for you to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe negative effects of blue light flux are:\r\n\r\n• Eye strain, tired eyes and bad eye health\r\n• Higher risk of glaucoma, and cataract\r\n• Phase shifting of the circadian rhythm, restlessness, and suppression of melatonin\r\n• Chronic migraine pain and activation of the trigeminal nerve\r\n• Chronic headache\r\n• Insomnia, sleepless night time and sleeplessness\r\n\r\nNight Shift - Blue Light Filter for Migraine as your anti glare night screen and warmlight night mode helps you by relieving eye strain and chronic headache during night reading. Its red light night shade is best for eye care against light blue rays from\r\nscreen light that cause glaucoma, melatonin deficiency, and sleepless night time - insomnia. Cataract often develops slowly, so start your tired eyes care and improve eye health with bluelight filter by using it as a twilight night light as soon as possible!\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n● Reduce blue light \r\n● Adjustable filter intensity\r\n● Save power\r\n● Very easy to use\r\n● Built-in screen dimmer\r\n● Eye protector from screen light\r\n\r\n\r\nNight Shift - Blue Light Filter for Migraine includes:\r\n\r\n+ Premade blue light filters - Use one of 5 anti glare bluelight flux filters to activate night mode and warmlight (red light) for eye care against natural light blue rays. Relieve eye strain, macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataract with night filter during sleepless night reading.\r\n\r\n+ Saving and editing night mode filters - Create and edit a night shift filter to rest your tired eyes from screen light or make a set of night filters to protect eyes, fix circadian rhythm, sleeplessness, insomnia and lack of melatonin after twilight.\r\n\r\n+ Dimming below system minimum - Use \"Dim\" night screen option to protect eyes from natural light blue rays. It's best for good eye health and chronic headache relief during night reading because it gives a night shade warmlight in form of a night light.\r\n\r\n+ Temperature customization - Use \"Temperature\" palette to set a warmlight (night mode) or cooler tint to your blue light filter. Twilight looking red light colors are recommended as a bluelight flux filter for tired eyes and used as a night shift for eye strain, chronic migraine relief, and sleepless restlessness.\r\n\r\n+ Color customization - Use \"Color\" palette to adjust the color tint, intensity and dim for your night screen. Night filter provides eye care and relief from migraine pain caused by screen light.\r\n\r\n+ RGB customization - Use \"RGB\" to fine-tune your natural light night reading filter. \"R\" - red light, \"G\" - green, \"B\" - light blue. Night light rests tired eyes with night shade and increase melatonin and prevent glaucoma.\r\n\r\n+ Automatic filter schedule - Choose the times in which the anti glare night mode will shift on and off to improve eye health. Ensure that blue light filter is always turned on after twilight to prevent cataract and fight insomnia and restlessness.\r\n\r\n+ Reduce power usage - Bluelight flux night shift reduces the night screen power usage. Use natural light filters to reduce night light power usage while relieving chronic headache and repairing circadian rhythm curing your sleeplessness.\r\n\r\n- It's FREE! \r\nPlease Rate 5 star to support this App. Thanks\r\nIf you have some suggestions, please contact us holotechlabs@gmail.com",

It doesn't work on the lock screen, on the pull-down menus or even on the icons at the top of the screen. Then the ad screen at the end doesn't scroll, so if you're in landscape you can't kihit the \"done\" button. A bad copycat of another much more useful app.",

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",
            "I am using the Motorola One Fusion Plus. It has a very capable camera but this camera software is its let down. It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos.

            "I used to love this app. It helped me get diagnosed with Endo after I read one of the helpful articles on irregular periods. Unfortunately, everything has been locked behind their premium membership paywall. All the helpful articles are gone, replaced only with endless prompts to buy their memberships. And so, I too must move on. I understand the need to make money, but for those of us who can't afford it, its merely the nail in the coffin.",
            "I've been able to track my period, ovulation, and even my pregnancy...very useful app! Update: I still love the app and its content. However, it has been difficult trying to change my pregnancy info. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and there were still some issues as the app tends to save prerecorded data. Also, I would love it if I could log personal notes and reminders. This can be done somewhat using the calender feature but only after that specific date has come or passed.",
            "I've been using this app for over 2 years now and it was great back then. Ever since they upgraded and got premium the user experience has gone down so much. I just like to log and track things and it used to be so quick and easy but every 5 seconds now you get prompted with an 'upgrade to premium' 'look at this premium feature' to the point where it takes so long to just try to mark one thing. You have great content, but when I hit X on something I expect it to close and not keep popping up",
            "Used to really like this app. All of the information was great! Now unfortunately you don't get anything but the tracker unless you pay. I am already paying through the nose for doctors visits and tests to try to get pregnant and unfortunately this just isn't an expense I can justify. I understand the \"subscription\" income is used to \"improve\" the app but I feel that myself and a few others would be happier to watch a few adds and still have access. The tracker is accurate most of the time.",
            "ETA: I don't know how others are able to get an option to log menstrual cup use. I've been using it for months and haven't seen that. It's pretty disappointing I have been using My Calendar for a good few years, and it's alright. Flo is great. I love all the information available and actually enjoy the \"chats\" to learn more about my cycle and my body. I also love how pretty it is, lol. I will definitely recommend it to friends."

            "This game is insanely good!! I have an underaged account, which is very annoying because it blocks some features, but it is still the BEST game I have ever played!! The graphics are very good and the gameplay is even better! All these people that say that it is PTP (Pay To Play) are WRONG!! I am at the max level and am very good, I have never payed anything! Hope anybody who plays this game enjoys it! Thank you very much EA for making such an amazing game!",
            "I love this game. I don't spend and still enjoy it, although it is a grind, so don't expect any quick progression without spending. My one suggestion would be to have a randomized pull in the beginning that gives you a random but guaranteed character. Doesn't have to be anyone amazing. 1 or 2 star character that then makes your experience of the game unique. I know you can try and pull from a chromium card but no guarantees and gems are too valuable as f2p.",
            "The game goes out of its way to ensure you're not making any decent progress without spending huge amounts. In the first 3 1/2 years of the game, new content and characters were frequent, though in the past year or so this has seen a rapid decline. Game modes have grown stale and repetitive. Any new characters have ridiculous requirements to obtain them, we are talking 6 month to a year to unlock. The game lacks balance, leveling up/gearing characters is an endless grind with little reward.",
            "Collect Star wars characters, what more can I say. Have had the game over 2 years now and don't see myself leaving anytime soon. The game has its ups and downs, and of course there is a pay to win element, but it's in no way essential. Metas change fairly regularly and all eras of star wars are given their fair share of attention. The game also offers a great variety of game modes: Single player PVE, guild based PVE, single player PVP and guild based PVP. A fan of star wars must have this game.",
            "STAR WARS: GALAXY OF RIP OFFS. Just ok. Starts out fun, but then the game becomes total pay for play. The prices they ask are ridiculous. Supply drops r a joke since 99% of what you get, is fairly useless. No really special stuff gets dropped and updating characters & ships, unless you're willing to drop serious coin - isn't happening. The new characters are impossible to get without $. Don't bother trying to contact the developers - you'll never get an answer."

            "Been my favorite \"go-to\" photo editing app. Wish there was the same features for videos. But I dont take many of those. So I don't mind keeping it strictly to photo edits. My only issue is the price. I feel for photo editing thats not as extreme or precise as something similar to photoshop; shouldn't cost more than photoshop. But thank you for providing with an app I do find enjoyment with!",
            "I have had this app for a couple of years now. Unfortunately have had to change phones which included switching back and forth from iPhone to Android. Even though I've already paid it now won't let me use features on my new phone unless I pay again which I was going to be a sucker and do but it tells me I have the wrong password. Google says I'm using the correct pw. So looking for an alternative app. Super annoyed. Over it.",
            "I love this app! Especially the part where when you do the smooth it doesn't turn you into looking like weird deformed baby! Like a lot of other places do! I often have to do some things on here and then go to PicsArt to do others but between two apps just amazing! that maybe we could have figured out how to do the things on this one that I can do over there but other than that I highly recommend this app!",
            "I really think that this app is unique and has so many features that you literally can play with your pictures for hours on end changing every little detail and having so much fun doing it!! I went the extra mile and paid for a whole year of premium and lemme tell you, when that year is up, I will be paying for another one!! My favorite feature is the skin tone adjustment. It's really amazing and makes your skin just glow beautifully!!",
            "I really enjoyed this app. Even paid for the subscription for the year. 2 stars because after about 2 months into my 12 months it told me I had to pay for premium features again. I tried emailing but no one got back to me and I still can't use premium features. Super disappointing."

And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

            "The only reason I'm choosing Pixel Phone is because of the camera. The quality was amazing ALL the time...until the recent update. No use of having great photos if the camera itself cannot be used. I've tried many ways to recover.. but it seems like nothing can be done to fix it. I've read many comments stating the same issue. Dear developer, please do something or you may lose more Pixel user..",
            "Updated phone in October after waiting as long as I could to not update it, and now the camera app no longer works. When I click it just shows a black screen with the camera interface over it, wait a few seconds, then it closes. I tried restarting phone, disabling app, removing other apps, shutting down phone entirely and waiting a while, and even a factory reset. Nothing has worked. Great timing for my trip to Yosemite. Thanks, Google.",
            "Google updated to androoid os 11 and camera won't work, just black screen like every one else. I've done a lot of research on this and it seems to be a widespread problem on not only the early pixels but also the new pixels. Google has had a class action law suit because of problems like this. Google does not care about you or else they would of resolved this. I was going to by the new pixel but now there's no chance in hell will I support the company.",
            "Took my first pictures with my new Pixel 5, the cool 2nd full moon of the month. The pictures are fuzzy, grainy, out of focus. Was excited to try night site. What a disappointment. My Pixel 1 takes better photos. Is this a bug?. Also, where did HDR+ go? No option to toggle or use, obviously didn't work for my moon photos.",
            "Camera stopped working completely after the last update. Tried everything to get it to work. Google was zero help and told me to go use a third party fix it service.... It's THEIR software that needs fixing. Extremely frustrating because my phone is in great condition but now it is useless. A smartphone without a functioning camera??? Do better, Google."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I really love this game, it is addictive. I recommend a few changes or I need to back away from playing. To decorate the way you'd like, it cost too much money. I think once you've earned an item it should be yours to keep. You only get to use it 5 times then you have to keep re-purchasing. Also, the \"My Homes\" doesn't keep up with your pace, you can only collect 50 keys then you just lose them. I wish when going through items to purchase you could sort by price. 5 stars down to 3, sorry!",
            "I absolutely like this game. The designs and inventory are pretty. I like the fact that they give you diamonds every day and have a chance to earn money on a design with out having to spend any money. This comment was when I first started playing the game. I have been p!aying for a few months now and I sense the frustration as others do about the voting process. It really needs to be rethought. It is not fair and gives stars when not due and no stars when due. People see differently!",
            "Love this app, but I would love some real review so I can learn how to.get the 5.0 scores all the time. Also, the app expects you to buy too much all the time with what is required. It makes it hard to just play in the app. We need more daily challenges. Update: I really like this app but it is so hard to do more than 1 challenge because everything costs so much in diamonds. Too expensive.",
            "Design home is my daily stress reliever. Although I love this game, I have to say that it is always taking forever to load and it is not my connection though it says I have a bad connection. For the few years I have been playing it I haven't complained but I'm at level 51 and just trying to load an option takes forever and sometimes I'm told item can't be found right now🤷🏻‍♀️. It's a little frustrating but still absolutely love this game. Please let me know if there is a way to improve this?",

            "I've tried many OCR apps (image to text converter) and none of them came close to what this app produces. Although it is still not perfect yet (which is mainly because of infinite handwriting styles), at least it doesn't produce gibberish like the other apps. I hope the algorithm keeps improving and it would be great if you could add speech for other language texts too.",
            "Have been looking for an app to transcribe my handwritten notes to editable text for a while. Just downloaded this app after reading a positive review. The said OCR is by no means perfect, but then neither is my handwriting and so far I am actually pretty impressed. I like to save an image of the page to OneNote and then copy the transcribed text next to it. Would be great if I could setup a macro to do both in one go.",
            "On my galaxy s9 I am using this app in tandem with quizlet (split screen view) to create a study guide. I'm surprised I couldn't find this option on google keyboard, but this is a fine alternative. Ads are annoying but never that bad, and the very empirical way the text is transcribed is much appreciated. 5 stars for functionality, overall 4.7 because ads",
            "Top of the line, excellent for small receipts and business cards. Good for books but you might need two or three takes per page. I couldn't test it properly for handwriting during the very limited trial time allowed. Overall the development of this APP is marvelous, excellent work!",
            "This app has been a very useful tool. I'm so grateful for the intelligence put into making it. God bless you guys. Edit. Now you can't use this app without subscription. It gives you a trial period, after which, you have to subscribe to use it. It's been good while it lasted. Goodbye, I'm uninstalling now."

I'm assuming my provider (Verizon, surprise, surprise) downloaded this app automatically during an update to my phone which is fantastic, since I was never alerted of this (read: sarcasm).",

I have been more than satisfied with the cell svc, their products they sell, the support teams, and most of all the protection products they offer. This particular app is of the highest quality out on the market. Can't go wrong with this one!!!",

            "Absolutely the worst...DOES NOT filter the \"unknown name\" calls which are usually spoofed numbers anyway, and are scammers, even though there is a feature to filter \"unknown name\" calls....IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Verizon and all of the other cell service providers have yet to figure this s**t out, yet expect YOU to pay your f***ing bill every month. PISS POOR SERVICE!!!",
            "This app is horrible, If I could give it Zero stars I would. I pay every month to use this app, but blocked calls still continue to come through, I get the notifications of the blocked calls, and they are able to leave voice mails. Every time this app updates it gets worse. All the damn money I pay a month for the service would think it would be a little but better but no Verizon is rip offs! This app was great until 10 updates ago, now it's junk! If it ain't broken, don't fix it!",
            "Piece of Junk. The thing is enabled and I still get calls daily saying I won a free stay at a Marriott hotel. This call comes from a different number every day so blocking one number (on my phone) doesn't help so I thought this app would do a better job. I'd have better luck teaching my dog long division.",
            "I seem to get more spam calls since they implemented this than i did before it existed. Half the time, calls marked \"possible spam\" are my actual health insurance trying to contact me. Worst part is, they charge for a version they claim is better. Anyone risking money on this app has lost their minds!! Blocking spam calls/texts should be the DUTY of the provider; NOT a service they charge extra for.",
            "this app works okay but it doesn't truly block calls they will burp in to let me know I'm getting a block call that certainly defeats the purpose of blocking the calls. It also allows the block calls to leave voice messages. Unknown calls and restricted calls should automatically be blocked but they aren't. Calls it do not ID the callers should be blocked also automatically."

            "As others have said, the app is currently broken. You can only sign in after you reset your password, and even if you do, the app fails to load upcoming trips. Other things are customer unfriendly. For example, if I want to cancel a trip, you now have to chat with a bot (versus just being able to do a simple \"click-and-cancel\" request). I understand that it may help Expedia's contact deflection measures, but it feels needlessly complicated.",
            "As of October 2020, the app has gotten much worse. Don't bother with it. Original comments: Works, but limited. You get a lot more choices on the webpage than you do in the app; so shopping for travel is mediocre. However, great to have your itineraries on the app. It would be nice if it stored full itineraries locally in case no connection.",
            "Was a pretty good app. Now will not show trips after you book them.. dates change between starting seach and booking. Have had several booking only to show up to hotel or car rental place to find out my booking dates are wrong sometimes days weeks and even months away from the dates I chose. Expedia points not worth the hassles of miss placed bookings maybe time to use a new service if they don't fix this soon!!! Ridiculous that these bugs lasted more then a few days....",
            "The app is very broken. When I open it I am greeted to a screen that is flashing and not responsive. When I go to close the app it opens back up and I have to fight with it. It was a good app before all this mess. Best part is my trip is in 3 days and I'm stuck using the browser on my cell phone. Just fix it.",
            "I rated this app earlier 5 star because it used to work really smooth. Now whenever I try to log in, it makes me do the image authentication plus makes me log in again. I liked it when it was simple and kept me logged on. I want to give it 5 star, so please help me with this so I can update this rating."

For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",

            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update.

            "Last update on Google play was sept 16, and today Oct 10 I am told my app is out of date. This is a security app, not tetris. Also, won't start automatically after restart sometimes. I have to manually start it (if I notice it's not running).",
            "Hello, my phone has been spammed. I thought this app is supposed to protect against that. Now I don't know how to stop the spamming. I keep getting messages that my phone will be locked if I don't install and pay for Spam protection.",
            "I haven't done the September update. I've read many customer comments and notice that the one common aspect to each one is the canned set of replies from the Verizon Care correspondent. Notably, that in each instance, the tone and tenor of the reply is condescending in a passive-aggressive manner. For example, inviting the dissatisfied customer to take yet another step, reaching out to customer care, to describe \"your problem\", again? It's a Verizon or digital secure problem. Start there eh?",
            "Still kinda on the fence with this app since switching over from a very corrupt AT&T. I can say that because I've been with them for over 20 years. They went bad about 4 years ago. Thank you Verizon.",
            "App doesn't allow Web security. You turn on 2 seconds later the app crashes I have no idea if I'm safe browsing on the Web > latest version 9/16 Issue still a problem !!!"

            "Historically this is a great and useful app, but most recently there are a ton of issues. 1, it crashes time and again. 2, other users also say they can't save photos. 3, my saved faves folder has disappeared. 4, latest version didn't need to change, just needed bug fixes, but the new version has not got the same features. 5 iPhone version has nose slimming but android version only has contouring which is not that useful",
            "I love this app, don't get me wrong. But just recently whenever I create a look and try to save it, the photo would usually go to my Perfect365 folder located in my gallery. Now, when I save a photo I can't find it anywhere!! I tried Uninstalling and reinstalling the app... Nothing and it's very disappointing because I use this app often... Please fix this!!",
            "Too many bugs, too many ads, would pay for pro if the app worked. Can't find any saved photos now, app crashes all the time, the ads in app cause more bugs, very slow, very glitchy. Too much happening and very poor quality. I only use it when I want to change the hair color on my pics now cuz nothing else works or looks good.",
            "It won't allow me to save my pics and then be able to post it to a social media like before. I click save over and over and nothing. Its very irritating and hope you guys can do something to fix it!! It used to let me save and post and then they would all be in my \"perfect365\" albumn in my pics. This was one of my favorite apps. But this is so disappointing!! 😕😔"

            "Used the app a few times now and seems to live up to what it claims to do. Took random photos, gave me loads of images from Google, Pinterest and any other places a similar photo was on the internet. Gave me explanations of the images. So far so good... Also read out any words it may have seen in the photo. I'd of give it 5 stars. But haven't been using long enough to do so. But liking it so far. Will edit if need be.",
            "Love, love this app!! I work for a non-profit thrift store and I constantly have to look up the value of items. Sometimes the search is off...usually, due to lighting, etc.. Most of the time the item I have taken a photo of is on the first few search page results. Regardless, it is my go to app for items I am unfamiliar with, that lack a upc. Most, if not all of my co-workers are Apple users. When they need help looking up an item, I cheerfully remind them that Apple products are inferior!🤣",
            "Unable to open after updating 😷 Everything was ok before untill it become so useful to me. Unfortunately after updating it become completely useless now. I can't even open the app. It just says thank you for updating . Please try later. I try to uninstall the update, again updated again but nothing really works . Requesting the technical team please help to resolve this issue",
            "I can't search Google by images anymore thanks to this app being integrated with chrome.. So now I can't search by images or find images of other sizes or even fact check websites that are using fake photos. Google's greatest feature besides the collaboration of the entire internet on one search hub was the ability to search the entire internet via one photo. Now thanks to google lens you can't; I'm not sure how this is progress but I definitely wouldn't call it that. Fix this.",
            "It is a great app. Google is always the first to develop such mind-blowing apps. About 5-6 years ago I thought that just as we can search anything on google, there should be a feature that allows us to search not by typing, but by scanning an image because there are many different animals and plants that we don't know about. But i thought that was impossible but nothing is impossible to google. Keep developing such impossible technologies, google. Great app."

            "For a paid piece of software, it does not meet expectations... The interface with regards to layers is clunky to use since you must use the 3 dot menus, there is a lot of ambiguity when you are performing drag operations as to if the command has been applied or if you are still dragging, and the green 'helper' circle which appears under your stylus is more of a hindrance since it is so big that it is impossible to make small adjustments",
            "This app is great and has really assisted in this time when schools have transitioned to online learning. However, I do believe that this app can be improved if more basic options are activated. For example, object properties should be made editable so that necessary edits can be made including length, angle, etc, Polar needs to be separate from the ortho button so that specific angles can be chosen. Object snap settings could also be activated so that isometric snap can be activated.",
            "Older interface was easy to use. New update makes everything harder to do plus i can't use color layers anymore. Garbage.",
            "Would be nice if these dumb developers would put there apps in the pay section when you have to pay for it. Oh 7 day free trial is still a paid app any way you look at it. Signed up for nothing and now going to get emails for something I never used. Do me a favor and put this in the paid section. Also its not just a one time buy but a subscription and those are the worst cause then you have to pay your life to use it and to look at any thing you made on it. So dumb how its \"free\" but no",
            "Requires subscription. I thought there would be an option for a free reader but there wasn't- only a 7 day free trial. I wish they were more upfront about their pricing and options in the app description."

            "I have loved this game and the play. But in the recent update and event, this has been a monumental failure. The new ranking system of pvp makes it more complicated to play with clan mates and it hasn't done anything to improve matchups. The new horde event with the collecting cards to gather coins to spend on weapons, heroes, and gear is just so complicated and frustrating. Why change something that worked for so long? The old way of milestones is so much better. Please go back to the old ways!",
            "Still a problem with PVP match ups!!!! Still too many cheaters, hackers and aim bots. And the match up algorithm is still a joke. Keep having to go against players with way more power. If you're on a win streak, magically you're going to have to face said cheaters, hackers and aim bots to knock your ranking back down. Been playing for almost 2 years and they still won't really fix this problem. I have too much money invested in this game to delete it. Oh well. Be warned.",
            "The new matchmaking system is just as terrible as the one before it. I have been playing the PVP since they introduced it and I have not gone beyond ranking 19 as I am constantly matched up against opponents far better than me, so nothing has changed besides the developers saying they have addressed an issue that so many gamers were unhappy with. And this new issue will take them years to sort out just like before. Steer clear of this game unless you are willing to spend lots of money.",
            "Great graphics good game except for the greedy pay to play system. This game also seem to have way too many server issues. Sometimes while I'm in the process of making a purchase it tells me I have been awarded the resources but it didn't actually happen. The devs will say it was added to my account when clearly it isn't. The match making system puts you up against players way more powerful than you are and you will often have to play against lame hackers that will not play fair.",
            "PVP is full of cheaters with hack codes, terrible system. Their servers lose connection nearly every day, multiple times, in the middle of a match causing you to lose. Extremely frustrating! If you love a game that the developers aim to beg for your wallet to get anything good to compete, well this game is for you!"

To stop the battery drain I must kill all related Samsung processes, clear the cache and reboot phone.",

            "I don't think Samsung cares or maybe it's just incompetence, but the combination of the latest version of this app and their other Galaxy Wear apps causes massive battery drain and connection issues with their Galaxy Watch. Maybe if enough people rate their poor apps they will fix it.",
            "Massive Battery Drain. I bought this gear almost a year back, since then I'm facing this issue. I think developer are not in mood to rectify."

Transitions are a little slow but, I'm fine with it; this app is doing what it's supposed to 👍. Total app size: 114 MB. No issues with this. Hey people: a 128 GB Samsung EVO memory card is $20 on Amazon. If your phone is \"full,\" clean it out and expand the storage if you can.",
            "So far good. Will need to see down the calendar a ways. 10/30 - still can't access cloud account. 'Sign in and password valid. We can not verify you have a valid account'. (Paraphrasing). When I purchased this tablet, I also purchased a 1TB account. Why can't I get in?",
            "The latest update (10/9/2020) on my Samsung Galaxy J3V is quite a space hog. The amount of space used has gone from around 40 MB to over 400 MB. The creepy part is that it continues to grow with no end in sight like some weird tumor. The growth is classified as data rather than cache. I was told could delete data but it would then have to re sync. It is now the largest app in memory. Asked if I could safely uninstall this update still waiting for an answer. Less than 3 GB left in storage space.",
            "Upload speeds to cloud server are extremely poor (1-5Mbps), files in the Verizon Sync folder fail to upload and will just repeatedly try over and over (which I suspect is the cause of reviews saying this app used up all their data), desktop app is clunky and outdated, can not log into my account via app from a second phone (my work phone), connections to the cloud service often time out. Competing services have never given me any of these issues and are far more price competitive. This service was included in my cell plan but I would rather pay to use a different service than fight to make this one work for free.",
            "Have never even used this app yet since the latest update my phone has completely run out of space. I have deleted hundreds of pictures and videos (DAILY), deleted apps, and am still unable to use literally anything in my phone. Can't so much as make a call or even try to open any app, including cloud, because they close instantly as it still says it's 100% full. Last night I just happened to notice that this app, that has never been used, is now taking up 10gb! That is completely unacceptable."

Great watch but not a very proficient app.",
            "Doesn't sync with samsung galaxy watch for steps or heart rate. Cannot manually enter steps either. Primarily syncs with withings gear. So I only use it to track my weight with my withings scale. Also the scale is strange in that it can't do math. For example if you weigh 190 on Monday and 189.5 on Tuesday it will say you lost .4 pounds.",
            "Can't connect Steel HR. Reinstalled the app, factory reset the watch but nothing. It searches for the watch but doesn't find it. Bluetooth is on, watch is active. It just doesn't connect. Edit: connected the watch to an iPhone which worked fine. Reset everything and tried again on my android (moto g6) and it worked. The watch is great, the app is fine. Wish it had more features and flexibility but it's fine.",
            "Update: I made a new account Withings account with an Outlook email address. Changing from 1* to 2* since I can now at least try out the device. Original: Unable to login. I enter my gmail and password, hit login, and it progresses to a page asking for name, gender, etc. However I can't enter my name or gender because a new pop up shows asking if I want to login with Google or email. Can't back out of pop up. Trying to progress with Google or email again leads to app crashing.",
            "Relevant information provided however inaccurate on linked apps like Samsung Health it does not transfer and record the data from the linked app efficiently or effectively. Misses between 200 to 300 steps, confuses workouts recorded and causes some workouts to be overriden in recording if you add your own workout. Needs some bugs like that fixed so it transfers and records accurate data from linked apps. Othereise I use it daily and like to see progression and results. Thanks."

            "Sometimes app do not sync with watch. I need my data back. I use to do 10-15K for Oct 2020. All of a sudden I could not see 10k being tracked. I could not contact customer service as there seems to be no hotline or whatsapp help. Example: I was about 7500steps until 11.30pm and I ran 2.36kms which is more than 3000 steps for sure and that did not sync to health app. This is totally frustrating.looks like a bug. I need it to be fixed. Calories also did not sync properly.",
            "Not much user friendly to use, Bluetooth does not auto connect, it does not shows in scan,device name is not shown in bluetooth scan list but still it connect ,I guess that's a bug to be solved,Cannot see data in app offline you need to manually connect even if its paired .App does not open offline.Most of the Honor watch ES features are not shown in app,require to update features,Need lot of improvement as compared to other Health apps.After that it can be eligible for 5 star rating",
            "I would really appreciate an easy way to export the data in a standard file format like csv or xml or gpx in case of tracks. Transfer of tracks from the GT2 watch to this app is very scetchy. The watch appears to register gps signals ok but only a small part of these data gdts transferred to the app. As many others i would like to be able to deselect step counting devices e.g. when carryimg both a watch and a phone. What is really ennoying is that max heart rate is consistently reset to 190",
            "Very Poor app and watch experience coming from Garmin. I REALLY regret going backwards to Huewel. I now have my time wasted to sell and migrate back, the watch features could be good, if you could export data to a useable app I would probably still keep the system. Happy with the way the watch looks like overall EXTREMELY DISSAPPONTED about everything else. UPDATE I've now bought a Garmin and once it arrives life will soon be good again",
            "Still there's no option to chose the source of step count, the app automatically merges data from phone and the band. This is extremely inaccurate! Tons of people complain about this missing feature for YEARS! This could be fixed easily, yet Huawei still don't care about the feedback of their customers. Shame on you! Guess what? Never gonna spend money on Huawei products because of 0 customer support."

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "It's perfect. it has everything A mad scientist would need. It works for me. it has the elements needed to describe My ideas. text,Collages, are only what's fundentmentally needed to create any photo you want using RGB, but you go above and beyond that, to speed up the process, of awesomeness. I don't ever use Instagram. I use what the forest says to be the best. this is clearly the best, since there are no in app purchases. Now being a smart PC guy, I call this app perfectly lightweight. :)",
            "I think remember seeing this in a advertisement and it was worth it although I didn't use it to co-op with Instagram. However inputting 10 photos is enough but not enough background patterns, stylish texts and the lamest grids but I do like the border feature. I actually do like the photo grid feature with how many photos. I was using the app for free by the way.",
            "Constant ads pop up when your in the middle of stuff. Worst part is you have to close the app and start all over becuase there is no close button on the ads anymore. Deleted.",
            "Great app! Fun and helps you create anything with the stylish layouts. Cons: too many pop-up ads. All I want is to create beautiful sets for my Insta page. 🤔📱",

            "This is supposed to be fun, not frustrating or leaving you feeling like you've been ripped off. The new update has changed the payouts on all the games of chance. Even if you get a \"special casino night\" it's a major rip-off. I started out with over 260 diamonds on my \"special\" hour and it took all of my money and my diamonds. I've already decided the \"Star Club\" aint worth it (tried it) The game isn't much fun unless you have diamonds-too expensive -my advice is PASS!! My id is Qpydz542.",
            "I love the game there are no ads in it. You can dress up style yourself your two bff will help you in this journey. Meet many people in the game u can even invite your friends to play with you. But there is 1 thing that I don't like in it that all the things are very expensive gems r less but give amazing dresses that which has to change and there are only 3 eye ball colours and eye shadow colours. Over all it is a lovely and amazing game u should try the game once in your life. 😍😇😁😁",
            "I like it, it's a fun game. I think the price of the clothing cost way to many diamonds, and not enough of them cost cash, mostly everything cost diamonds. And you don't get many with purchase unless you make a large purchase. And the up scale clothing stores should give gift bags. And why do I have to pay for a date? Haha.",
            "I want to take the time to express my thoughts on this very very cool game! I believe that while I am a star member there is really no benefit to it. $19.95 a week is way more then you should be asking for. It is misleading. You still have to spend money to get ahead not to mention the runway battles are REDICULOUS. It is full of cheaters wearing skirts on top of dressed and looking completely silly yet they win. And the ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM IS TO JOIN THEM HOWEVER IT'S not even fun anymore!!!",
            "I'm irritated that everything that can help you in the Fashion Arena cost diamonds!! I'm irritated that I did the download of that stupid chef game and finished the tutorial but never recieved the reward for it so I had to spend 5 diamonds to skip it so I could continue with the storyline. It sucks that everytime you get \"busted\" in recieving gifts from fans the price of continuing goes up. This isnt a game. It's a money pit!!!"

Normal fixes (clear cache, reinstall, etc) do not work. Worked fine until just recently. All other apps on the tablet function, as intended. Only one does not, Verizon.",
            "While the app itself can be useful, please don't allow yourself to fall for the Verizon Up reward program that the app will nag you about incessantly. You essentially agree to allow them to spy on everything you do with your phone, and harvest all kinds of your personal data in the process, by signing up for it. They aren't trying to be your pal, they just want your consent to profit even more off of your account.",
            "It does not save my login credentials - I have to re-log in every time I open it, even when I have \"Remember Me\" selected & permissions on. Logging in is a two-step process so this wastes time. This is the connection my computer uses (a jetpack) & it has a data limit so I need to track it, which means I have to put up with this every day (I haven't found the same information on the website). I didn't have this problem with the old phone, which may have had an older version of the app. Annoying.",
            "The app keeps me up to date with my data limit, I can pay my bill, look at my bill, and get my $3.00 Amazon gift card every month with the app. Make sure you take advantage of receiving and using your $3.00 gift card every month to offset your bill. It's a nice litte bonus at the end of the month that actually helps.",
            "Very buggy along with their website. I been trying to fix my billings, plans, add-ons for the longest time and still seem to be getting the run around. App is worthless and keeps logging me off. Broken links or none what so ever. Now I am wondering if I made the right choice. When downgrading plans, make sure to un enroll in any add-on or you won't be able to un enroll afterwards and be charge each month. Check when changing plans that you don't get hidden or added fees."

Thanks for the great app!",

Have had this app for several months but only used it today for the first time on my new phone which has a good macro camera. I note scans are saved to phone, not external card, why not? Seems to overwrite my preferred camera save location so I have to jump through hoops to then transfer files to external card. Not so good 🙂",

Holding the camera to the four corners of the photograph \" without tilting the camera\" allowed the while holding steady was frustrating if impossle with a smart phone. The resulting images were very poor. I tried just using the stocked functions that came with my androids camera and got easer shots with sharper images. I'm sorry guys, I feel generous giving it 2 stars. You're google you should be No. 1 !/",
            "First time use was okay. Then it began not get the scan. You have to move the phone to the four circles to complete the scan. An you only have about 30-40 seconds to do. Which is difficult since your not supposed to tilt the phone. Was unable to find any settings to increase the time frame or adjust the scan time. I am looking for another app that is easier to use.",
            "Terrible quality scans of photos. I got much better quality and higher resolution by just taking a picture of the old 4x6 photo with the camera on my phone. Great idea but poor execution. Hopefully it improves with time because usually I love stuff by Google."

If we have to make a choice it's like 15 gems but when the chapter is complete we get only 1.I respect that you worked hard on this (maybe because I am 10 years old)but i would appreciate it if you could improve it. Thanks for the game btw.I think it was worth giving 4 stars. Thanks for the game!!!",
            "Stories seem like they could be fun if you had a lot of money to spend on buying diamonds. Every important decision only has one free option. There is only one or MAYBE two free outfits and then all the characters complain. I appreciate the work that went into the game but seriously? And I find every game similar to this one is the same. Honestly, even though I am curious and would like to, I am not even going to finish the first \"book\".",
            "This would be great if you made it worth our time. Your cost on diamonds for reading a chapter is absurd. Maybe 10 diamonds for every chapter read. Get with the times. I'm sure there are other apps similar that probably are way better. Which I'm going to go find because you can only have the story go one way. Maybe bring down the cost of the outfits. Make it worth our time. This app is a disappointment based on that.",

U can pick from criminal, crime, romantic, comedy, and many more sections of books that u want!! There is only one problem to me and that is whenever u download it, it let's u pick ur clothes out, I feel like we shouldnt have to waist our diamonds on the first pick if clothes for what u select. It is my opinion. But besides that, the game is really fun and good!! Hope this help!",
            "I love this game with all my heart it is so fun and interesting, it uplift my moods I really enjoy it as we know the is a but in every story, my only problem is that the story demands more diamonds and in the end of every chapter we get 1 diamond. It takes lots of time to get another ticket, 1 hour is a lot for one ticket of a wonderful story. Lastly the ADs, the story demands more data but some of us cant afford to spend more data in every ADs. Thank you for the wonderful stories"

I am very nervous and wondering. What did I get my self into?",

I remember when I was younger I'd play this game and from then to now the game feels a lot more polished and in my opinion is better then most games you have to pay for on the app store. It definitely is a grinding game, you will need to work and put in hours of your time to make sure you get the weapons you need and such, but that's part of the fun! Definitely check it out if you like fps shooters and zombies! It's great!",
            "New to gaming, other than old school stuff. Many are just too complex for me. I am really enjoying this one, having easy play modes, and user friendly aim and shoot, or sing zombie upside the head. Oddly satisfying, fun great graphics.. finally one that I can play and advance in, while getting better as I go! Thanks guys, rocked it.",
            "everything is great about this game, except for one change that I disliked and that is that the zombies in the arena just get an HP buff in every round instead of just doubling the quantity and speed of the zombies, you just end up with firing 20 bullets just to take down one zombie.",
            "Good time killer. I like the graphics and controls. I will admit though, weapon packs are expensive in the game and really do help. So far I have sold two cars, refinanced the mortgage and sold my kidneys and other organs to play this game and advance. Well worth it though.",

All my achivements are gone,ever sence i updated the game it wiped out all my levels ive finished,all my achivements , please help\"everything was going great till this game had a problem with athenacation,what happend,can i get back and retrive all the levels and achivements ive finished"

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "Does not pair!!. As many have pointed out, the program fails at the very first step - i.e. devices identifying each other. Wonder how HTC could create a piece of software that has its basics wrong at a time its struggling for survival. After all, HTC phones were once so popular for their quality of Software and ease of use.",
            "How to make it work: Wi-Fi on new phone may shut down when trying to transfer and transfer will fail. Try this. On old phone make it a hotspot with SIM card installed. On new phone search on Wi-Fi for old phone as hotspot. New phone will save password address but will not connect. That's okay. Then go through transfer process but opening HTC Transfer app on old phone and on new phone going to settings and tap on transfer from old phone to new phone. Let the phones touch each other. Works well.",
            "Asks illogical questions such wants PIN entered on both phones whilst it provides it at none. There is no going one step back, app will close. Can't select wifi/nfc/hotspot/??! Fails connecting !!! Vague, bad, and simply missing instructions all over app. It gave me no chance to determine the from/old and to/new device as I intend it but seems to solemnly want to base this on version and/or type of phone? You can REALLY not imagine any other situation or reason for different order HTC?! Rubbish!!",
            "Nothing transfers. Doesn't even offer to transfer apps, but that's fine because it doesn't transfer anything it says it will either. Uses a wifi hotspot to connect from htc to samsung. Either Samsung blocks this on purpose, HTC is just that bad or, more likely, a healthy dose of both greed (Samsung lockout) & incompetence (HTC).",
            "My old phone, a Pixel is running Android 9 and my HTC U Ultra which I really love by the way is running Android 8. After i did some reading I found out that you can't copy from a higher system to a lower system number. Disappointing but reasonable."

Also, the rating system is unclear, and it would be helpful to know on what it's based."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "blurry external wallpaper while locked - I want an option for my Razr to have no blur while in peak view. At least let me control how much blur there is. Two weeks ago it was fine, but now it's like we turned the background blur from 30 to 100. I have been trying to fix it for the last six hours. 😭 Who can I send screenshots to in order to collaborate a fix?",
            "My Razr's Peek Display Clock and notification icons are a clouded mess. For some reason, the exterior display wallpaper is constantly bleeding through Peek Views display. I have to end up making the wallpaper only black to see Peek View correctly, otherwise it looks like a blurry wallpaper covered by the clock instead of just displaying the Clock and Notification icons.",
            "After last update, making calls with the phone closed through the contacts shortcut swiping left just stopped working. When clicking the contact there's a message saying \"app isn't installed\", please help me have this back as I use it too much",
            "After the last update (Jul 2, 2020), messages like \"finger print not recognized\" have been shown too close to the clock. And why was the blue arc around notifications removed? And is it my impression or the blue arc around the clock is in a different color? Why? It's not big dea, but if you're going to change such a thing, you should, at least, permit us to change the color (to green, pink or anything else)",
            "Dialling emergency numbers when in pocket and incorrect unlock Pattern ERRORS I think this happens when the clock shows when in your pocket and you accidentally do a swipe maybe brushing your leg. this brings up the pattern unlock and also the emergency calls screen dialler. i get this often and its very annoying. Perhaps add an option into moto screen peek that fingerprint locking DISABLES IT and power button lock ALLOWS peek notifications and clock.  This would be awesome. Please"

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Great game play! There's always something to do to keep you busy whether it be trying to breed a weekly or monthly dragon, completing clan quests(once you get to that level), or participating in one of the frequent events to win food, coins, dragons, and more! I can honestly say, with maybe a little bit of shame, that I can play this game 6 or more hours a day and not get bored!",
            "I love this game, I've played when I was younger but, now I remember the game and realize that I love it! There are so many adorable dragons! When you need to feed the dragons I just don't want to because they are cute just the way they are, but since the developers thought about that, they added the Fountain of Youth that made things 100x better! I find no problems with the game no glitches, it never kicks me out. Keep up the great work Gameloft! :)",
            "This is one of my favorite games!🤩 But you may wonder why I didn't rate it five and just four instead then..🤔 this why 1. Search bar doesn't work for me when I search up dragon's names 2. I am an active player these days, but when I get dragon eggs, it sometime takes 30 seconds, but then some take 21 hours!!!🥴🥵😵 3. I can't pay for VIP or for more gems, so can you please put more ways to get gems, cause I know how to get them, but can you add a way to get gems faster if your in a rush?",
            "Minus a star because im playing this game on a phone and finding it more difficult to see anything because there are too many icons on the screen. Also when you have an egg go onto where it hatches, if you have that dragon already then there should be some way to delete it without waiting for the hatching, which could be anything up to hrs to days.",
            "It's very frustrating that I am in the middle of a task or battle and I get kicked out of the game and I loose what I have done. Also it takes to long to log in. And must of the time hat I log in i get kicked out immediately. I have complained several times and they suggested that I didn't have enough memory in the device so I bou6a memory card of 120gb . And It improves for like a week, and then when back to the same issue. I play the game to get relax and enjoy not to be frustrated. Help me."

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

Wow just emailed att I get a response telling me to call them terrible customer service from AT&T.",
            "This app was working well but started ignoring my settings to allow my contact list to call thru. ALL incoming calls would go directly to voice mail with no ring or notice. Only way to receive calls was to disable both this app and it's companion security app. Call Protect needs to be a stand alone app not tied to any other apps. When Pre loaded apps mess up, it's a nightmare, can't UNINSTALL completely. All you can do is disable and remove all their updates. SUCKS!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!",

This error has been going on for awhile, but now not even the old version works. Please fix. I am going to have to download another call protect app if this error message continues.",

Check your connection and try again later.\" There is nothing wrong with either my connection to the ATT cell network, my wifi, or the Internet. I tried this app multiple times on 2 separate occasions 24 hours apart. This app is what Att Customer Service recommends for addressing the hundreds of political texts soliciting me for money, ATT and the app developers should be ashamed.",

I really have a problem of paying for something and not getting it. Even with Wifi it won't work. I have tried disabling the app. Did not work for me. I would like to have it..But want it to work."

            "Its ok. Its best for home window shopping. If you're seriously looking, it's less convenient. It assumes how much you're going to put down and what interest rate you've been approved for. There's no way to set those things so it gives you a more accurate idea of what you're paying each month. Plus, in my area theres a lot of 55+ communities and theres no way to filter those out, which is irritating.",
            "I like this app, overall, but would really love to have the ability to hide or dismiss a property from my search, if it's not one that meets my needs. I like that I can save homes, but when searching later, homes keep popping up that I would rather not look at again! Also, if there is a way to get HOA/Space rent to be mandatory when there is one for the property, that would be great. I've looked at many that stated there was none, but that wasn't true. Thanks!",
            "Zillow gave the option to turn off cookies, but did not bother to mention that it will erase all of your data when you do this. I went ahead and typed everything in once again, and it erased it AGAIN. Also, you can't add photos, videos, or tours with any Android phone -only i0s I want to know what kind of incentive apple is giving developers to leave these flaws in their designs..",
            "I use this app almost daily, it keeps me up to date on homes that I am very interested in. We will be buying or building in the next 5 months, we are looking forward to building or buying our dream home. I love Zillow, I have found it to be more up to date than a Real Estate office. I highly recommend Zillow. Thank you, carolintallahassee",
            "While the interface is the best I've seen out of all the other real estate options, the information is not accurate or up to date. If you try to get information from the listing agent on the app, a third party starts messaging you and sending your information to unrelated agents. I simply messaged asking about an open house and some random dude was trying to get me a new buyer's agent even though I already have one."

Love this app 😻",

            "This game is a wonderful offline game. I have no signal at my job. The signal strength literally has the circle with a slash through it and this game is still 100% playable. The controls are easy, you get skins for your weapons, and you can even purchase a battle pass if you want more rewards. The only downside is that they always ask if you want to purchase a certain gun after each game you win, but it's not overwhelmingly annoying. Perfect offline game!",
            "This game is one of the best zombie game I have ever played but it's has some probs though. First the guns are too expensive they are really too expensive, and you can't even play a level twice like you can't go back to the level you played before 🤦that's annoying, and the free trial for different guns will just keep giving me the same gun, that's even more annoying, please try and improve your game thanks",
            "Been playing it 4 ovr a yr. now & only spent @ least $15 to $20 on the game,but watched alot of commercials & advertisment. It's a hard game until u get down to the last few guns in the gun category. I'm close to the 5000 gold bars to get the last gun that u can get without spending $ for a gun,it took me awhile 2 get 2 where I'm @ but can't wait 2 👀 what kind of damage it will do. 👁 suggest that any 1 should 👎 load the game & give it a try & u got 2 hav patients. A must.",
            "This is a good game to play different levels of play and location's with plenty of zombies and creatures to kill with a variety of weapons and boosts that you can upgrade to 😰 except it's got a few glitches that need sorting out !!! Keeps turning itself off 😡 annoying 😡😡 even more irritating does not play videos all the way through so you can't get gold or double your winnings have to keep reloading all the time and it freezes alot 💩",
            "Lost my data for a few days and had downloaded Dead Target because it's played offline. I was expecting much but was really impressed with how great the graphics look. It's a great game although a little bit to much blood for me but still couldn't stop(Throwing Grenades at Zombies🧟‍♀️).I'm sure some things could be a little better but hey , I was just really happy that I was able to even play something offline. 👍🧟‍♀️🤯"

            "I LOVE the Sims games. I've been a LOOOOOONG time player, including the first pc games. But the simchase episodes kill me. I work my butt of trying to complete the challenges in time to get the prizes but the last 4 episodes tend to be impossible! The tasks take longer and longer to complete, while the challenger seems to fly through them. Paying big bucks seems like the only way to get any of the prizes. What a shame. I already know I'm going to lose yet again.",
            "It could be better. Needs more updates than you think, our sims disappear after a while and need to make new ones, glitched money meaning expensive houses are free. Not the common sense I'd like from a game as this. The graphics and music is old. Please update that too. In other words furniture and housing is beautiful. Thank you for the new style for sims as well. With that being said the game has been untouched, only \"events\" happen but never music, graphics, quality has ever changed.",
            "I know writing this review is a waste of time cause the developers only care about your money. The more you play the more expensive it will cost you. The quests are taking longer times and the only way to beat them is to spend your money. And on top of that half of my simoleons disappeared over night. Some quests want you to use 11 sims but the game will only allow 6 at a time so it takes twice as long to complete. So a 3 hour quest is now 6 hours. If it stays Ike this I will delete the game.",
            "I just wasted 500,000 simoleons that I payed for on this \"Simschase\" event. I was constantly checking the game to start the next task, but I still lost every episode because I have to go to school, and sleep and actually have a life. I bought the simoleons with real money and it all got thrown away. I can't skip tasks because the only way to get social points is to have Facebook friends who also play the game. I should not have to pay and pay and pay just to play this game.",
            "Game has gotten worse. Being forced to start events or stupid Simchase thing. Having to clear app cache and data every so often to make sure game doesn't screw up. Only reason I keep the game is so that my wife has a neighbor now that Facebook has cleared inactive players from the database. They send out updates without testing them. Too much content in a short span of time. Now looks like you have to spend real money to get things to complete tasks."

            "Fantastic app! It could use a few more settings so users can tweak everything, and it would be nice to be able to pause the video-in-photo playing for a good screenshot. This is really a great app so far. *** One important problem I see with this app is that when you touch a spot on the screen to lock the focus, there is no way to make it autofocus again. :/ I got this app for the video-in-photo feature combined with the semi-manual focus feature, but the autofocus doesn't quite work right.",
            "WOW .. just WOW !! After years of being frustrated with my Android device cameras, it's popped up in my play pass and I thought well let me give it a try. By FAR the clearest images & filters that you have just right as you're taking the picture without losing your shot. No more twisting and turning and getting cramps in my hands. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ★",
            "I like that it opens up instantly soon as clicked. No annoying whatevers to have to wait for. I will say its better than my fone camera. I have a galaxy flip 2. And I'm very disappointed with this camera. Was expecting better but probably would be better on a fine with better camera. Would like to see more filters, maybe add some fun Snapchat type effects but good job guys..",
            "I am happy with my device camera which is far better than this application with slow motion, time lapse, boomrange, short videos,image and video effects, low light sensor, sony imx sensor, phanaroma, HDR, timer, beauty mode, tilt shift, manual, image stablization, bokeh mode, potrait mode and many more settings available in my device camera i dont think this app has something special to keep this.",
            "It's okay. Trying my Powerdirector app for video editing and it will not accept any files that I use from this app. That was a deal breaker. I had to take each video file and convert it to the proper codec. There is no option in these settings to do that before transferring to a editor. Way too much time consuming just to get a decent video clip for editing. Not worth the time or effort."

            "I've used aldiko for years, but will now be looking for a different app. Stupid ads make it unusable. When you open the app, it now opens to an ad that won't go away. There's no way to go back or X out of it, it's just stuck there. It's a shame. What once was a good solid app is now garbage..",
            "I've had aldico premium for years and loved it. Recently I moved hundreds of ebooks to the SD card on my Samsung Galaxy tablet and now I cannot get the aldiko reader to open any of those books. I've spent hours on the internet trying to find how and I'll have to change readers if you can't resolve this for me. Thank you. Blue",
            "Come on guys. Love the app, but all the adds recently. Mostly the ones that pop up when the app starts and won't let me pass, making the app unusable. No cross to close the add, clicking on the add doesn't work either, not does pressing the back button. Forcibly closing the app and restarting just shows the same add again...",
            "I would give it a 5 star if it had a search option. since some books do not have a cover, its hard to get a book unless you search it through other mean and then choose to open with Aldiko in which case it tells you that the book has already been added. I hate that but otherwise it is a superb app",
            "Tried creating a note. It took me to the subscription screen, but there is no alternative pricing. Only monthly. Forget it."

Is there anyway to clear the numbers in the activity sectipn? I have a list that goes back over 8/9 months. I use it often however still have the same problem with the ph. nbrs. Is there a way to delete some of the old nbrs?",

We have done the software and app updates and it still isnt working. Edit: It's now 10/29/2020. It has been 6 weeks and we still can't send or receive any media. This is ridiculous. I've reported it several times and no one seems to care to fix it.",
            "The app was great until my last update. Now it doesn't alert me with a sound or a number to indicate how many messages I have, when I get a notification. I went into setting to make sure my permission is on, & it is. I have to tap on the icon & open it to see if I have any messages. I'm missing, important information & meetings if I don't keep looking!",
            "Latest version is NOT as good as previous. When I upgraded phone to Galaxy s20, I expected the app to work better;thinking the software was not updating on an older model. Looking at other reviews, the new version of the app seems to be the issue. Since this is a new phone, I am stuck with non working version Auto Reply and scheduling features are now missing and not functioning over multiple devices. I preferred this app because it also worked with other service providers. No longer the case.",
            "Recently switched to a new phone and I am not getting txt messaging unless I open the app. I have gone through all the settings and uninstalled/reinstalled the app but still no fix. I have reported the bug several time. Apparently, a lot more people are having the same issue of not getting txt messages on time unless app is open. Please fix this issue.",
            "The app is great. Have used it for years, but just got a new phone and it uses the phones default notification sound when new texts come in. The only way to change it is to customize it in each text. You used to be able to change the notification sound in the main customization and all texts would come in with the sound you selected. That option is still there, but doesn't work anymore. I like different sounds for texts, emails, and regular notifications."

            "I loved the game at first I even made it to level 50. However, after months of playing the game investing my time and money it rebooted and made me start over from level 1. They took away my home and Sims family. I was so disappointed. They have since fixed this problem and returned my level and items. I love this game.",
            "Ok. I like this game. But one thing that i really don't like is that they don't notify us of new updates in the game. I would have to go to playstore everytime i suspect there's new updates. Sometimes i would have missed more than a week during an event before i update and i miss good products. So I really hope they would change that and notify us within the game. Otherwise i love it.",
            "I love the game but some things are still quite annoying in it, like the challenges, some are impossible to get unless you make use of real money to purchase sim cash. It think they should make the challenges quite easier to win reward becos some people can't always afford that. I am also hoping to see pets and cars in the game. By the way nice one EA and Maxis",
            "Quite good mobile adaptation of The Sims game. Enjoyable. -- Problem though: My Sim is female but Izzy designed male clothes for me on the first try, and still male on the second try. My starter Fashion Gems all wasted since females can't wear male clothes. Suggestions: 1) make Izzy able to detect the current Sim's gender or allow us to choose. 2) State the requirements of player's name so that we don't have to keep guessing why it gets rejected.",
            "Have all sims in collection. All great only complaint in this game is the loading and the none selling of items in storage.Be good if could add more sims. Over all great game. Am enjoying it. If the situations were resolved i would give a 5 stars. cheers.."

I really hope that this glitch gets fixed because it was one of the best screenshot apps i've used. I really wish i could give 5 stars, because it was really good. But for some reason its just bugging out always.",

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

            "It's a blast to play and definitely worth the time to. However at later levels you're forced to grind for a long time to get what you need to upgrade your base and the zombie difficulty begins getting higher than your survivors can seem to upgrade. Also, the zombie hunt rarely drops anything good, and you can't seem to unlock Rosie, the bow ladh.",
            "I like the controls, graphics and the interesting raiding mechanic with the unique graphic style with gory, explosive gameplay that some other zombie games don't utilize. However, there are too many ads and pop up for a game that has very repetitive gameplay that after so many raids grows boring and takes a long time to progress to the point where you need to watch 60 second ads to get the items you need on top of all the other annoying pop ups. It has potential.",

            "Had a problem with subscription features that as far as I know, cleared itself up (no support, clearing the cache didn't work. Did that, uninstalled and reinstalled and ensured I was logged into the correct account. Gave up, came back to the app a day later and was able to use HD features and all filters). It took a little less than support to respond, so that was good considering this is an app where you shouldn't run into many issues. Only issue, reorganizing your filter collection is a pain",
            "Used to be good but the quality fell, the filters aren't as good as they used to be, it is slow, and it suddenly became a subscription thing. There are very few filters, and the advert for the subscription or the free day trial keeps popping up every other moment. The few free filters are low quality and there doesn't appear to be many locked ones, so doesn't seem worth the money. Am very disappointed.",
            "The photo styles are great and I like that there is a choice of SD or HD, and that a variety of settings can be modified with the ease of a slider, however, the styles themselves are limited and there doesn't appear to be a way to include more (either as a freebie or paid). As much as I'm enjoying it, I don't see myself using it even the full year with that limitation. I'm on the fence as to whether it's worth the yearly cost. I have photoshop on my desktop; I'd be better off with that.",
            "amazing array of effects. totally engaging. few options that I wish were there: 1. search or filter effects based on criteria. Considering there are so many effects, searching through them to find the right one is time consuming. I wish they were sorted in categories or even better had a search option with facility t filter search results . 2. compare effects / compare with original option.",
            "Great app only problem is I used to be able to isolate a person and take the filter off only on the person or have the filter only on the person and the everything else normal. I really liked this feature and idk if it got removed or if it was moved and I can't find it."

            "While the only thing you do in this game is level up characters, it is surprisingly complex. I've played mostly for free(I bought some legendary tomes, they are hard to get). The game is very stingy in what it grants you. You have to be patient, unless you spend money. I've been at it for about six months. He'll hades has some excellent strategy guides on yuotube.",
            "Been playing the game for over a year now, and I had to drop the ratings. I love and enjoy the characters, great designs. Also, the game play is awesome. I don't like how the better characters are coded in a way to where you cannot obtain them if you don't spend money on shards. You need a ton of shards to get them; afterwords, you need more money for gems, enegery for leveling, also making your characters stronger. The tournaments are fun to a point.",
            "It's okay. The campaign gets a bit repetitive where you end up kinda just watching your characters walk down hallways as you tap here or there to attack or buff. That's my only real complaint, the graphics and design is lovely. The various in-game purchase ads are a bit annoying since you'll sometimes have to X out of 5+ windows of them, but I get it. If this is your type of game, you'll most likely enjoy it.",
            "Fun, in depth game play with lots to do. Awesome job on that. The only issue i see is the constant pop ups. Advertising promotional deals is great. However, you take it too far. It's more than just \"from time to time\". It's ALL the time. Calm down a bit on the advertising and people will calm down a bit on complaining about it.",
            "2 stars for good graphics but that's all that's good. If you have an issue and report it in the \"Game bug\" forums thread, all they do is ask for screen shots, well the problem with that, mobile phone or Android versions there's no option to add screen shots. I have mentioned this in forum threads and emailed you a s s holes time and time again. What's the point of support? Everyone should record all battles Then replay them in slow motion.. you'll find that you've been screwed since the start."

I've restarted my chromebook updated stuff and still the program crashes. I still gave it 5 stars. I'm a photographer and used it often, I really liked how easy it was to use and the results of really editing a photo not using filters but kind of making your own filters ;)",
            "Had massive issues at first, I kept on crashing anytime I tried to save or share. I reinstalled and everything works a treat. Really straight forward to use and in-depth editing. The previews of each adjustment is handy. The dehaze seems to work far better within PsX? It's never made more sense until now. I've been using Photoshop for decades, I've got my issues with Adobe, but I'm really liking this app.",
            "Love this! I can adjust all the important stuff like contrast, color, exposure, crop, tint, etc. As well as being able to add portrait effect. It doesn't allow you to fake anything with pictures like regular Photoshop. It just let's you adjust what's there which is exactly what I wanted. No fake beauty standards here! Just real photography editing.",
            "Just starting to use this app. Other than 1 crash I had trying to create a collage (hoping there are'nt any more crashes etc...) the app itself is neat, seems easy to use, a small learning curve and easy to navigate. The app was obviously designed for the average person who hasn't got a lot of time to learn how to use a complicated and professional grade photo editing app. Although...I can see a professional photographer using this app. Lots of good bells and whistles. Well done Adobe👍🏼!",
            "At first, I didn't know which app I could use to edit my photos, as I am a new born in photograph life, but this app gave me the best of the best. But my problem is that the very same app I enjoy does not allow me to watermark the photos, therefore I have optioned to watermark my photos using my mobil phone, otherwise I am happy with this app. I can recommend it to a new baby on photograph world"

            "This app used to be great, recording steps, bike rides and transport with reasonable accuracy. Now it has thrown me out and forced me to become a new user and I have lost all previous data (even with the same user name) plus now does not record calories correctly saying I hardly use any when excersizing. Extremely dissapointed and need something better that does what this used to do.",
            "No stars if I could!.... Rubbish....Now stopped working all together except for the occasional heart beat record. My smartband appears to be working but the app is not up dating the info, which is a shame because I can find nothing else that works with my smart band, which is still fully functioning. So very frustrating.... 19-07-2019 original review, Would like to give it more but it no longer records when I am in the car, I frequently walk a 2 & half hour car journey",
            "Edit, October 2020: The last update deleted all my data. Sony have no pride. Don't buy their products. Original review, March 2020: I have been using Lifelog for 12 months. In the start I felt it was a good app. At the time it was certainly one of the best life-loggers that logged steps, sleep, weight and calory burn in a single app. Over time it has become more and more unstable, especially the last couple of months. Counting from the start of 2020 I have registered 9 days where the app did not count any steps at all. That means that the step-counter counts 0 steps approximately one day each week. This means that the statistics that shows the numbers of steps each week, each month etc is always much lower than you would expect. It is not possible to input manual corrections. If manual corrections were made possible the errors would just be annoying, but without this functionality the app is useless.",
            "Somehow managed to walk 4km taking only 338 steps... Seems the step counter is a little inaccurate! Two years later no improvement - now not syncing with swr30 or recording any steps or location data... Pretty much useless unless u want to track only your sleep! And another two years later, more of the same.. Worked for a bit, now not counting or syncing steps from swr30.",
            "Still tracking steps but not tracking sleep since I updated the app. It tracks how long I've slept but not how much light or deep sleep I've had, it just says I'm awake all the time! It's a real shame as there doesn't seem to be an alternative app so does that mean my smartband is obsolete?"

In this update we improve the call blocking experience for users on Android 10 (“Android Q”) and higher: incoming calls that you wish to block will now be blocked completely, and not forwarded to voicemail! You can enable this behavior by setting Hiya as your default caller ID app. Please let us know of any feedback regarding this change. We also squashed some bugs and ensured things are running smoothly overall.",

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

In terms of research, this has been incredibly useful, I use the storage feature (it saves the highlights and notes to a file on your Google Drive) to go back to what I had previously found important. This is, perhaps, the most important app on my phone. Sure, it has some drawbacks but I am ever-so grateful for the ongoing work on this product.",

I live in Germany and I using a German smartcard, but although my mobile phone is set to English, I only get offers for German books. I have to search specifically for English speaking books, i can't brouse unselfconscious throughout the shop. There are still good offers for English speaking books after all.",
            "I used this app for several years on my android tablet but recently all books in my library and samples are opening in unreadable formats: only a few pages at the beginning show and they are not aligned with the screen. They are cropped so that part of the page is unreadable. The rest of the pages in a book are blank. Google Play Help was useless in fixing this issue.",
            "A very, very good app it does not require money to download and does not require your credit or debit card number for buyin free books the audio for audio books is very good and you can even change the page colours as per your eyes like. A very realistic flipping animation. Overall it's very awesome and I highly recommend you to download this.",

Yet I can't find my purchase anywhere, neither in the library nor in my purchase list.

            "M giving three star bcoz of the prices... The collection is good but limited...and the main thing is price... I guess this is too much you should cut out in the prices. Otherwise a normal person will not buy from your app bcoz its wasting of money on buying suxh expensive cloths.. And even in todays fashionable time no one is gone repeat the same thing in the party n all. So totally not gonna buy expensive clothes",
            "I downloaded this app a month ago and all of the sudden I can't open the app on my phone, Please fix it.",
            "I've order from them twice 1st time took 2 n half months said they couldn't find my address.

I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",
            "Love the game can't seem to put it down. No problems with my iPhone! The graphics on this game is amazing its clear not blurry like those othe war games. You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

            "This is a frustrating app. On one hand, on one of my devices, this app is great. It runs properly, is decently clear on what everything does, and having the peace of mind that my photos are safe is nice. On the other hand, on another device, this app crashes every time I try to move photos to a different app, is slow when doing anything else, and ends up wasting my time.",
            "So far I am LOVING THIS!!! I have only just begun using OneDrive, not knowing entirely what it was to begin with. Now I look for it wherever I am. I can open ANY file from pretty much ANY device! Word, power point, excel, etc.! I find that impressive. Especially since it's Microsoft. Like, I think Google tried to do the same thing but something just doesn't feel right over there. This is where it's at. Hands down. So far I highly recommend.",
            "I don't understand what's happend with this app. It worked perfectly fine and then Samsung backup switched to using one drive and it just isn't uploading anything right, it's not uploaded and new pictures from the last month since it change apart from some pictures from a year ago. Then it's saying it can no longer back up from and SD card? There doesn't appear to be anyway to change back and it's not clear what I actually have backed up now. So disappointed.",
            "Setup trying, should be made easier. Sometimes it takes days for uploads. Amazon is good for auto uploads. Making sub- albums is nonexistent (I used to keep info on leases, rent receipts, complaints, etc. in separate albums then group them under 1 album). Even Google changed that capability. I can't deal with these egomaniacs deciding what to do with my pics.",
            "Works ok except one annoying issue. The file dates displayed appear to be the dates the file was initially created and not the date the file was modified/synced. You cannot tell if file is modified until you open and inspect it. This problem is unique to Android version. Works correctly on all other OneDrive apps on other platforms (IOS, Windows, etc)."

The more MONEY you spend, the more you can HARASS others. Not the most elaborate strategic war games I've seen but its ok. Gets a little boring with all the waiting around. Horny sounding and looking animated girls narrate the game progress. Whatever floats one's boat...",

Like, it unecessarily cuts my 1500 game golds in the name of HQ transportation, when I tried to transport it to a nearest place of my guild member. After deducting the above amount, it simply says it cannot be done due to some kind of boundries. I mean, which type of game is this when I am unable to help my team members, couldn't arrange a rally or be a part of it? Seriously, a lot more work is required to improve this game.",

As far as I can tell, there are very minor differences, such as you can't choose the United Kingdom, Helena isn't available in the beginning, and Pandora is now Chimera (though a lot of the spoken dialogue still references Pandora). Really lazy re-skin, but that music makes all of the difference. Stick with KoW is you've put any significant time in it, otherwise play this for the awesome music. Oh, and zombies!"

When I also understood that review your edits and use the brush for Double Exposure, I was so stoked because the only problem I had with this app was that the image does not get inside properly and when I try to darken the added image, the 1st one gets lighter and then gets beneath. Although now I have no problems.",

            "A very user friendly app and exceptionally efficient. I've been using Snapseed for quite sometime now. However, over the last one month, I've been encountering an issue, whereby I'm unable to add borders to photos using the 'EXPAND' option. This issue didn't exist earlier. Please look into the bug, it would be really helpful. Otherwise, Snapseed is my favourite photo editing app!",
            "The experience of working with snapseed is really good. But I would like to share something with snapseed creator's. I think snapseed should add a feature like remembering the last edits for a long period like for a month or two. It would give a better experience to the user's. Her in this update it's like if you have edited a pic then again you come you'll have that Last edit but if you have edited it in the new way you'll not be able to use the last edit again,it will no longer be available.",
            "Overall the app is great, however I noticed that average ratings don't really draw developers attention, hence the 1*. Some basic tools like invert colour are highly desirable, but missing. This is the main image editor that i am using and i'd love it to be more complete, to eliminate the need of another one."

I used to love their supima cotton t-shirts. Now their t-shirt fabric is flimsy, transparent, the edging round the neck rolls outward and the side seams twist. 2. Last week I bought clothes for my son and this week they have zeroed my points! 3. The vouchers they offer are for stuff I don't and wouldn't buy eg household stuff.",

Nowadays, people are spending more and more time indoors during the day, and thus the time of the eyes being exposed to blue-enriched sunlight is reduced. Eye exposure to appropriate amounts of blue light during the daytime is healthful, and it helps cognitive function, elevates moods and synchronizes body-clock.\r\n\r\nMedical studies have shown that blue light in the nighttime disrupts people’s natural sleep-wake cycles by suppressing the production and release of Melatonin (a.k.a. Sleep Hormone). So, we should avoid our eyes exposed to bright blue-enriched artificial lighting and electronics screen before going to bed. Disruption of natural sleep-wake cycles may be linked to depression, diabetes and obesity.\r\n\r\nBlue light within the visible light spectrum consists of two components, i.e., blue-violet light (415 - 455 nanometers) and blue-turquoise light (456 - 490 nanometers). Blue-turquoise light is preferred to blue-violet light because of the following two benefits,\r\n\r\n1)  More efficient to regulate the Circadian Rhythm. \r\n2)  Medical researches show that blue-turquoise light may be less damaging than blue-violet light, which can bring on AMD (Age-related macular degeneration) and digital eye strain.\r\n\r\nCircadian Light Meter (CLM) app is to assess the Circadian Entrainment and Blue Light Content of your lighting environment by measuring the amount of light entering the cornea at a vertical pane, which is called vertical illuminance (Ev) in Lux unit. After obtaining the Ev value, CLM then calculates the Circadian Entrainment according to two different metrics, namely, Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML) and Circadian Stimulus (CS). Those two metrics are adopted by WELL Building Standard v2 under Feature 54 Circadian Lighting Design. \r\n\r\nCLM also evaluates  the blue light content emitted by the lighting fixtures, which consists of two components. The first component is the percentage of blue light out of the total spectral power of the visible light spectrum, and the second component is the relative percentage of blue-turquoise light and blue-violet light within the blue light content.\r\nDifferent make of Smartphones may show different Lux reading due to its own light sensor performance.

            "This app is fine, except I feel frustrated by how slowly this app loads and how long it takes the shutter to close. There is a lot of shutter lag. The app description claims this camera app is \"really really fast with zero shutter lag\" but that has not been the case for me. I want to be able to take pictures of my family when funny things happen. By the time this thing decides to wake up and take a picture, the moment is gone. I'm on a moto g5 plus.",
            "A couple days ago, while looking for 2 videos, I noticed that they'd moved from their regular places. I then checked to see if the Date stamp changed too and it did not. Second issue: as I reviewed the details on the videos and then a group of photos, I noticed that the Time stamp was wrong on every single one of them. I reviewed the Date & Time setting on the phone itself and it is set correctly yet photos I know were taken in the morning are timestamped hours later. Nothing online to fix it.",
            "Wow! I've never seen an app get this much negative feedback! I took a few minutes and read several comments and it's quite clear this app is broken. The cameras in these Moto E5's do work but you will need to download a working camera app because once again this app is broken!!! It took me only a couple of minutes to figure it out I wonder what's up with the clowns at Motorola! I'm not a cell phone or software expert I'm just a guy who can read and understands what he has read. Fix your app Moto",
            "App gives camera error every time and does not save photos any longer. UPDATE: Found that having a 64GB micro SD card formatted as internal storage was what was causing the problem. Switched to 32GB and now use it as external and app works. (had been working for nearly three years the other way) Must have been an update to the phone when I wasn't looking. Maybe the E4 was just too good for the price they charged and they had to downgrade the phone. Upgrading review to five stars.",
            "Worked fine for many years. New update makes the app unstable. Frequently crashes on start. Randomly crashes during use. I suppose this is modern software for ya. Fix what ain't broke. Changes nobody asked for including UI - consistency out the window. Push things out the door as fast and cheap as possible - quality out the window. Updates that make an already trivial program require even more fantastically powerful devices to run... Your streaming pixel data to blit to the screen... Come-on!!!"

            "Good app. Finally showing room sizes in the search results. Please add room size filters to save time searching. Hotel star rating often does not match the real rating, for example many 5 stars properties are actually 4 stars or unrated. Prices can often be misleading as they do not include fees and taxes until the final step of booking, and then the final price can end up to be significantly higher. Final prices should be listed at early stages and we should be able to filter by them too.",
            "I made a booking and then I found a cheaper price though someone else at the same property. I tried to cancel the booking and have the cancellation fees waived and when it came time for me to hit the confirm the fee waiver button it went straight to cancelled for $65.00. I literally found the other price less than five minutes later and immediately cancelled the booking.......smh. Bad Business.",
            "Terrible app. Too many bugs to list, and I couldn't even write them to tell them about it because the Google Recaptcha just kept asking me to select images over and over again. Oh, and after trying 5 different times to book a flight, I got \"reservation failed\" with no explanation. One time, when I went back to reserve, the same flight I tried to book initially went up $70. Oh, and you'll have to scroll back about 420 times to enter your DOB cause you can't enter it manually. What a joke.",
            "Frankly the app is really great. I usually check the googles and find hotels online. Then i open up booking and compare prices. 90% of the time the mobile booking app has deals and tends to be cheaper by $10 to $30. Not much but that extra $10 can go towards a meal or something else like the mini bar. I love it and i recommend to all my travel buddies.",

I'm getting high speed only when I call 199(Jio general helpline). After the call the internet speed becomes 2G again. This is so annoying. When I call that number, all of a sudden the range and internet speed increases. So horrible experience with Jio.",

As per terms and conditions if one downgrades or unsubscribe the plan then on the membership will be deactivated, but no where it is mentioned that if there is a gap of two recharges the prime membership will be deactivated. This was never commucated with the customers. Even your team is least bothered to notify the customer. Dropped and email but no proper service. What is use of collecting money and not providing service.",

I have complaint many times but they always say that sorry for this we are working on it. It does not deserve even a single star. I think , I am going to mnp it in vi or airtel.",
            "I used Google Pay UPI @VPA to resolve late night payments via local banks. App is great. Only wish app wouldn't upload my contacts online, especially on Jiophone. This behaviour makes me distrustful of all apps, even if it is for getting names for numbers in Jio contacts database. Customer Service is awesome except for early days when we'd lose next day's data balance if we used full data close to the cut-off time of the daily data reset. Was bad on weekends! CS had no clue how to help & no data"

So I tried once more to add a person to my family tree that they had recommended and it still tells me to upgrade so what the hell is the 129.00 for ? Now I am in a dispute to get my money back that should never had been taken. They suck and I actually rate them negative 10 stars !",
            "The site makes it hard to cancel the free description. They make u go thru 4-5 pages & u have to fill out your information & number & keep asking over & over for extra confirmation to cancel the free trial. That's so aggravating. Also, the site didn't show my family in Costa Rica, seems like it only can search in the United States.",

            "While I have always backed up my photos on Google Drive, it's nice to have the Amazon Photos complete backup as a failsafe. However, Google's photo software is not usable, and Amazon Photos has a couple of features that are outstanding. The user can place selected photos into any number of albums. An album can be selected as your tv screen saver. More importantly, it can be sent in an email, allowing the receiver to view all the photos in the album, hundreds if desired, with a single email.",
            "I love how everything syncs to one place. Amazon photos puts different people in their own little album, so its really convenient if you are needing a picture of a certain someone all you have to do is go to their album and any picture you've ever taken and they are in it (even way in the background) it'll be in their. My boys looked identical as babies and we were so surprised amazon could recognize which one was who. Its also nice to have memories pop up from the same day 1-5years ago.",
            "Since my Kindle HDX DIED with years of photos I couldn't print on it., This Amazing Amazon Photos APP helped me reconnect with the Majority most of the photos that were backed up.. This APP actually helped me reconnect with some photos I hadn't seen in years, because I hadn't realized that my photos were being Backed up each time I plugged it in to recharge the battery. So grateful for that. THANKS AMAZON 🐸💖STILL accurate information. I can STILL can go back to pictures I took 5+ years ago. A",
            "I was invited by a friend to share pictures on this app. I thought what a cool idea. I HATE that this app copies all the pictures on my phone, and stores them. Now every picture i take goes to three apps: Gallery, Google Photos, and to Amazon Prime Photos! I also HATE that there is NO left navigational plane foe me to get into the trash can",
            "Amazon photos is not only easy, it is convenient, take a photo and it instantly comes up on my Echo Show, it's like having a moving picture frame!! Also can watch on the TV and my Amazon tablet besides the Echo Show. Paid for additional photo and video storage, compared to having them printed!!"

            "absolutely loved this app. I have been using it for months but after the recent update, they made the makeup tool vip. I'm probably gonna delete the app now since it was my most used tool and i can't afford it now",
            "This app has been pretty valuable for me over the years that I've been using it. I tolerated when they decided to lock some features, since the more essential tools remained free and are uniquely useful enough to keep the app. I just had to look elsewhere for the other stuff. But when I went to use it today, I noticed they locked even more features - the essentials, aka the tools they've been most notable for. A pretty foolish move, honestly. So I'll be deleting.",
            "Reshape tool now requires a paying subscription, and it's not cheap! You used to be able to use it, you just needed to watch an ad whenever you saved your photo, but I guess they've gotten greedier. It was the only reason I used Facetune at all - all of the other tools are free on many other apps. Save yourself the trouble and money, just download any free photo editor.",
            "Certain things aren't free anymore, I don't like how you guys are taking the best free features away just to force people into subscribing. I also see how you guys made some features free which are tools I don't use for editing. This used to be the perfect app for selfie editing, for a long time too! But now it's useless to me. You guys are a sad case. I would give it 5 stars but no thanks. Uninstalling",
            "When I first downloaded this only a few of the edit options weren't available for free. It seems every time I go to edit now, more free things are getting taken away. Before it was reasonable, it's just ridiculous at this point. Looking to try different apps because trying to force users into buying your subscription is insane."

            "Good game, I hated seeing the ads all over the place making it seem like something else entirely, but I downloaded this because it would get me extra diamonds in the Animal Restaurant game. So far I love it but I'm at the point where it's taking hours to do tasks and soon it will be days and weeks according to what others have said. It's a shame, since it's a well made game but at least it's not as egregious as FFXV A new empire.",
            "Great game to begin with but soon becomes boring when your settlement is constantly attacked by rival factions to bully you out of the game. I've got better things to do than play games with immature players who think it's clever to attack players who are weaker than them. There's insufficient opportunity to defend yourself against attack, and no control over more powerful players hitting weaker players over and over again. Plenty of aspects of this game need improvement. Not good for players.",
            "Dont get me wrong, guys. I am still playing it to the very end (which is right after the corner) but i just cant give this game more than a one star. Why? Well... The game itself is good, if not for absurd donate system. There are certain items u just cant get without donations NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. When i discovered this ( after like 2 months of playing) this fact alone just CRUSHED me, killing any joy and will to play, because no matter how long and hard i try, ftp player wont reach the top.",
            "Good but after last update now game will not load. Tried to reload last update still have same issue. Version 1 9 42 1000 day 3 still does not work. I wonder if you are working on this problem. Just updated game t0 1 9 43 1014 still no change game stoped mid way in the load of base. Still can't load game, no new up dates. Nothing new game still will not finish loading. Hopefully the next update will work, this one was very poor.",
            "Great game.. been playing for sometime now. However it be nice if we could expand more of our settlement with added features such as building vehicles to travel instead of always walking. Make first vehicle free but upgrades are earned same as hero's. Through progression of game play... second review still love the game but still think changes can be made for better game play.. thanks kingsgroup holdings definitely would recommend if these slight changes can be made"

            "Love it even with the free version 😃 I dont personally see many ads so that's a plus for sure. It definitely helps to keep me motivated to drink water more often an stay on track",
            "I thought the app was awesome when I first got it and was more than happy to pay to unlock extra features. Now I've come back to using it after a break and found that despite paying for the additional features I now no longer have them and have to wait to unlock them. Cool app, but if I pay for a feature I should keep it, even if you update the way the app works.",
            "App was nice until they've changed the subscription to a monthly one. I've previously paid for the full version only to have it revoked with their new subscription system."

            "This app is apsolutely useless. This is fifth time that I am reinstalling it in an effort to make it work. It simply does not upload photos and I bought it for this reason. It manges to transfer 160Mb from more then 50Gb of photos. Half of those that are saved to Web storage are with error. I really do not get it. First time in my life I am writing a bad review but this app simply deserves it.",
            "App is broken, when entering into folders it is good but going backword it takes me to recycle bin and there is no menu option to go to main home folder. App is extremely poorly designed and not worth using it, asus shame on you having such a terrible app in production! Whatever feedback here from the customers should be priority and should be hot fix, but I bet they will do their best to ignore all negative comments.",
            "Useless application, if you want to maintain something like folder syncing, look elsewhere. Only automatically backs up your pictures and nothing else. All other files need to be manually uploaded.",
            "Takes forever to upload some files which are around 3gb. It should not take 3 days to upload. It just keeps saying 'uploading'. Seriously developers, this is very poor. How can you get the basics so wrong. You can't even upload folders which is very important for me. You have reviews here stating the same thing, we are trying to help you to make it better!",
            "This app is virtually useless. It is badly designed, making incredibly poor use of the limited space on a phone screen. The appears to be no way of uploading a complete folder, and having painfully selected all the files in the desired source folder, the app quits as soon as I try to upload them. Consequently I cannot use the 1TB storage I have paid for. ASUS make great hardware but they should be thoroughly ashamed of this dreaful app."

            "From getting new gadgets, finding old original parts to fixing issues, the Carlcare app is the ultimate one-stop shop. I was able to register on the app, reserve a slot and speak with a customer care representative before heading to their office. My phone was fixed in no time, and as a bonus for being a first time user, I got a new charger for almost nothing. I love this app and will be using it much more often",
            "Worst aftercare app. The response is so slow. I keep waiting for hours sometimes days for proper response. The timings of the care centers are inaccurate most of the time and the inquiry option doesn't even open most of the time. Honestly needs a lot of work.",
            "I purchased Itel vision 1 plus. The phone is good looking but the major issue is that its mic and speaker is of very bad quality. Voice is very noisy when listening call and second party also complain that your voice is noisy. I will not recommend Itel vision 1 plus. Although it was economic and good looking.",
            "So far carlcare has been very useful... I brought an original Android charger for 300... So cheap... And they sell phones in a very affordable price with discount at times.... The best part is they exchange old phones for new ones at a very low price... It's mind blowing.... As of now it's been very useful",
            "Excellent..I never knew about this app..only till my warranted phone got fixed.. This is like a healthy insurance 😂😂😂 special advertisements on TV,RADIO,NEWS papers etc.has to be made... Many people don't know about it..though the live with the office in the same neighbourhood 😂😂😂"

If you are looking to just kill some time then this game should fit in quite nicely but if you are not looking to spend on the game then you'll face a ton of ads which will annoy you eventually. The in-app purchase deals are not so nice by the way.",

This game was epic, now it just sucks.",

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

After I borrowed a real level, it was easily 3 degrees off level, which is insane. Don't waste your time with this app. I used it without my case on an Pixel 4 Xl with location services turned on and the whole shebang. Avoid using.",
            "With a 10.3 inch tablet, it really shines. Anyone complaining about accuracy, maybe it's your phone/tablet's accuracy. Also, like a real level, the longer the baseline (length) the higher the accuracy.",
            "Quickest rating of given. I haven't had this app for a full five minutes yet, and think it's awesome! Stay full-time in a 36' travel trailer, and literally lay my phone on the counter and adjust the trailer to feel extremely level. GREAT APP, so far. I will probably upgrade if the price is fair.",

            "I am writing this review after using this app for a while. The UI is really awesome but most of the functionality in the app is incomplete. Sometimes I click few of the buttons and waited for something to happen but nothing was really happening at that moment. For instance I click on play now for the games or join us button in the app, there is no notification that I have been added or there is no loader no make the user understand that something is going on the background and the requested action is in progress. I think as a user, I expect most of the things to be working in the application I use and if something is not working or something will be up soon should be notified. Also if something which is not functional should not be shown in the app. If it is shown for any reason, the user should be notified if there's some problem or he should be redirected to that particular page in a while with a loader. Also the loader used is not visible clearly on all the pages. I hope you would take care of these bugs in your next update. Thanks",
            "Honor play runs with High Power Processor which is able to Handle all task as compared to other smartphones so why other devices like 8X and 10 lite whose processor is not good as Honor play and similar camera performance Received ARCORE support and why not Honor Play Please provide it fast I am waiting for this feature since from beggining",
            "Well the app is pretty good But I like to mention some things that could be improved 3 : The app does not feel like a Android app but it feels like it was stacked over Chrome browser because on navigating between menu it give the functionality like Chrome or any other browser . 1: Under the offer section please change the colour of description text from blue to any other contrast colour like white etc , because the background is also blue and text appearing under the description is also blue so it does not feel good and comfortable while reading . 2 : I think that Huawei club ap can also be integrated into this or do vice versa , because I don't feel good while keeping two apps which one app can do easily .",

I only found out that Google knows it is incompatible after I opened the email on my PC from Sony telling me I was good to go for transferring my data and I had a month to do it. :/ Great hardware let down by sub par software.

More users, followers are definitely going to depend on this app if these helpful features are introduced. Thank you - - Uday Kulkarni.",
            "Truely awesome. Well done. Only one problem is there that you can directly select a file and open it from Fast Scan. You have scroll alot images to get your needed image selected. Must provide selecting images from gallery/other apps in different ways. Thank You. Good Luck. 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",
            "Is this a joke? You put free in title and give only 3 days free and ask to pay. I don't mind you asking for price but instead you put it on the free store and asking to pay after download. Move your app to the paid store. Edit : Google asks for adding cards to get paid automatically after 3 days. Bug or intended I don't know.",
            "I liked the app very much. But for some reason, after cropping and aligning it outputs files of very poor quality (low resolution and extreme compression artifacts), which makes them barely readable at times, even though I have put the quality options for both images and PDFs all the way to the max in the app settings and my input files are high res sharp photos. Do I have to purchase the app in order to get a good output quality?",
            "Excellent app. Super great. Saved me a lot of time and money. Thank you FASTSCAN team."

            "Honestly one of the best fps games in the play store that I've played. Love the weapons, the graphics, and the overall feel of the game. The ability to backup/restore really comes in handy for moving to new devices, or even if you just want to delete the app for a while when you're low on storage. Wish there was an online multiplayer, however the lack of that is not enough to rate this any lower than 5 stars. Great game overall.",
            "It's a good game but it's missing some important things like customizable control and auto shoot if possible but most importantly customizable controls, it is really hard to aim and shoot at the same time with thumb only if we could get multiple finger support for example allow us to shoot in right and left both side so with right finger I can aim and with left I can hold it down to shoot, I hope we'll get it soon 😁 great game.",
            "It is a best app to play like free fire Advantages: *good graphics *good gun collection *good creations *good game for fighting the zombie *we can play both offline&online Disadvantage : *THere is no jumping key. So this is the only disadvantage for mee. This zombie shooting game is very interesting to play. So everyone try this game.",
            "One of the best zombie games on mobile. But, as always, half the guns can only be attained with 'Gold'. Meaning, practically impossible to attain. So, basically need to pay real money to attain, or watch tonnes of ads to play casino for a chance to get a few gold at a time. Dead Trigger 2 is no more generous either.",
            "The game is really good with graphics, Here is the bad of it.. -First the Aim side is in same side with the shooting button, thus very difficulty to manage both. -Second you have made the prices of weapons to be very high in such a way that no body can afford. -Third, knowing that we can't afford weapons, you have made the missions to be very hard really it's boring. -Fourth,at least you could design a place to hide,zombies are coming in all directions as rain and you find youself in the middle."

            "Better since last updated . Before i had lots of issues with the game and now its just an occasional hiccup and when it does go out its game wide and everyone gets some type of apology gift. Still a lot of differences between free vs pay but better for free now than it was in the past. I love my faction and this is the best aspect of the game. They make me want to log in even on busy or bad days. Try it, just wait to be sure that you're gonna keep playing before you spend too much $$$.",
            "I absolutely love this game but my biggest complaint as I've gotten into later game play is that, every time I try to raid, I have to refresh for up to 30 or more minutes trying to find an opponent within even 90,000 levels of my rank. I've even been given the rank 23 person twice before I've gotten someone close. A person whose rank 100,000 should not have to almost exclusively fight people in the top 1000 players. They're characters are exceptionally stronger.",
            "These seasonal events and just events in general need to be lowered in team power all together. Literally feel like i cant do anything in the Halloween event because you need a S11 or higher team.... Hey Devs? You want poeple playing and enjoying your events and content later on yes? Why have the power for seasonal events on the roadmaps be for S11 - S12 and up? Why not have as many people as possible enjoying it? Why save it for players at the end of the game, or people who pay lots of cash?",
            "One of the best game i've ever played but the raid is so unbalanced,the wars is the worst its so unbalanced that it's almost impossible to win.Imagine workimg hard to get strong then ended up being defeated by a rich player who is at low level but have strong characters.",
            "Royal Coins fail. I've won enough to at lease have 800 TWD points/coins but yet my number is still stuck at 550. Between yesterdays jackpot and today's I should have had enough to unlock TWD Shane. But its like its stuck to that number. Can someone like help me."

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

It's pretty frustrating. After having my wife try it out, i did find that the UI is not user-friendly, she's used to kindle, fbr is just weird .. i guess it was simple enough for me, but maybe some UI work can be done to help noobs (like my wife)",

            "Don't download and use, this app is used by scammers. I've received several of the Apple ICloud scam calls asking me to download this app to \"fix\" the issue. This is a scammer app, use at your own risk!!!",
            "I often use the free version of TeamViewer to help my brother with his PC issues, so thought I'd try it for mobile phones. We have the same phone, so I installed this on my phone, to test it out. The PC connected (telling me that I was limited to 5 mins), and worked very well, but then suddenly disconnected after a minute or so. When I try to reconnect, I keep getting an error \"Connection blocked after timeout\", and tells me there's a session limit, and to retry again in a minute. So I wait a minute.... and am told to wait another minute, then another minute. Some time later I tried again: I got a minute or two of access, then kicked out again My first impressions are that, unless I pay for the full version (we're talking £15 PER MONTH here!), this one isn't going to be any use to me, so I'm only going to give it one star - sorry!",
            "To the developer, you need to be more clear on the purpose of this app. People are often more stupid then average and down load apps because what they assume the purpose of the app. It works perfect for the intended use; i.e. helping move around apps and trouble shoot remotely. Not controlling games are all kinds of no sense Ive read in the comments. Smh"

            "I really like the way Sky map is set up, the options are great, but I have a confusing issue (solved). You were right, Sky map didn't know my lat and long, I played with the settings and it's right on point now, thank you for your help. The constellations seem to be rotated out of alignment. As an example, Cassiopeia should be almost directly over head given where I live and the time of year, but the app reports it on the Northeastern horizon instead, even when I use search.",
            "This app is awesome! I have yet to experience any other like it and I am such a nerd for astronomy anyway and it really helps to learn the constellations and actually ends up being an entertaining and learning experience for anyone but also for children they find it absolutely fascinating and it's been my experience that it opens their mind to science and space. I recommend it hands down way to go Google sky map!",
            "I really enjoy using your app. One suggestion of an option I would like to have, if possible, would be able to select an invisible background. Using the camera field of view as a background would allow the map to be seen as an overlay of what the camera lens is pointed at.",
            "This is fantastic. It gives real time location of the stars and planets. Just hold your phone up to the portion of the sky and you will see that portion on your screen. Point it down, and you will see what is below the horizon. Just be sure your phone has a compass and gyro. Otherwise it will not work.",
            "Bumping it back up to 5 stars now. I updated the app and now I'm able to take screenshot. I did try to email the Devs., but the email was returned as \"recipient unreachable\". I hope the Devs. see this as google play leaves no way to reply to their reply. Not sure how many stars to give this app after this disappointment. I have had this app for a long time. It's great, until tonight. I saw something really interesting that I'd like to share online but I can't. I can find no way to take a screenshot of the app. Why is that? Is there something that I can change to force it to let me take a screenshot? I have taken screenshots of lots of other apps I have on my phone and this is the first time I have ran across an app that has screenshot capability blocked. What's up with that? If it were not this issue of the app blocking screenshots, I'd give it 5 stars instead of the 3 that I'm giving it now."

Much more importantly, the timestamps on the copied/moved files *should be the same as the original files*. Having 200 gb of files with the current date and time is useless.

            "This is a great game for players who are wanting to play against other teams and players who want to shoot guns +different modifications for sniper rifles. Very easy controls. Definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. Thanks to the Development team on this game hope to see more games from these developers.",
            "There is little time to get all enemy, no indication where enemy is, there is no stability of the gun while in hand, no one is that unstable, it's not real life action holding it. The game is based on snipers having the opportunity to kill one another, so why are they getting hit so many times bleeding out and recovering?",
            "I'm just a casual gamer thats been playing the game more than a year, and right now am at level Elite Sniper (1@2, not too sure)... I've only noticed within a week or so that I'm being put together with high rank players (usually just 1 player) and rest would be bots... This occurs throughout all the battles i choose, be it deathmatch, raid etc... I just want to play casually, get my daily rewards, collect my points, cash n diamonds via deathmatch n such. ..",
            "Youre clearly outmatched half of the time as you get killed just as the screen opens. You dont even get a look at the battlefield & youre dead. The only in game purchase worth the price is MAYBE cash. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. But when the battles are fair, its pretty fun game",
            "At the beginning it was okay because I believed that there are other individuals who are online playing but I've found that the chatrooms are fake , every single person is playing with robots, and the scores for each game is completely made up and they are not real. If you don't buy anything from them for your game to upgrade you can't continue playing. ."

            "It's a very good app, but the photo editing options are less. It would be very helpful if there more editing options especially in the colour option. Also, saving the pdf is taking a lot of time. If the time for saving is reduced it would be very helpful. Other than this, the app is great. I can smoothly share assignments using this app. There are no ads in this app which is great! Overall it's a good app but it could be made better by adding some more editing options.",
            "Good app. But this app tends to lag at times. Please make the generation of PDFs faster because it takes a lot of time and because of it, I could not submit my assessments on time. Though the copies were checked, but I had to listen to warnings from teachers. Please make the generation faster. Otherwise it is a very useful app and is handy too.🙂🙂🙂",
            "Finally we have a phone scanner that works about as well as a flat bed scanner! I've tried a few of these types of apps in the past, and they usually had issues. But this one seems to have hit the bulls eye on everything. The auto-detect borders almost always works, the adjustments are easy, the file size is reasonable, the touch-up/edit features work very well, and it doesn't erase your entire scan if your screen turns off because you had to step away for a second (like DropBox does). No complaints about this app so far!",
            "I'm using this to scan my answers to exam questions, then i make them pdf and send to my instructor. This is the best because I can select different filters for better look and legibility. When I pick a filter, I can shoot photos back to back without stopping and it will turn all of them to my selected filter. Also, it has auto-detection for documents. When I direct my camera to a document, it understands the context i dont even need to shoot or crop, it does everything by itself. Super useful",
            "my main issue with this app is that it cannot pick up each section of a certain document consistently, e.g I'll scan a document and half of it is very light and difficult to identify, while in reality it is just as dark as the other half of the page, though this may also be partially attributed to background lighting. nevertheless, this app simplifies processing and downloading scanned documents and for me, is more effective than a standard camera."

            "I don't know what the people complaining about this app have on their phones, but I have had no problems at all. I love this app. It keeps my phone running smooth. I free up memory and change permissions to keep apps from screen using my battery. The only problem I had, was trying to find it. So I could put it on my home screen. I would also add, I don't want Samsung Members app telling me fix something. This app should do that. The Samsung Members app asks for too many intrusive permissions.",
            "A must have and a very helpful App for daily phone management task. I really appreciate the enhanced deeper settings. The only reason why don't I give 5 stars rating is the configuration I set in the Deep Sleep Apps in Battery Manager section is auto-reverted to the default state after applying the last update, in which All Apps that I had blocked (disable) to run in the background had gone from the list -- the Apps list was cleared, so I had to reconfigure it all one by one manually.",
            "The app is constantly crashing . Error msg Said - \" Device care isn't working\" then a few other System files \" aren't working' . I'm not Sure if its a Note10+ problem or Samsung acrossthe board but the errors & Crashes are too frequent on numerous critical apps. Ive never had a phone that Completely freezes or had so many errors/Crashes before , System optimizing always reads 100% but each option needs to be dealt w! seperathy to optimize each segment.",
            "Nice app but on the note 20 ultra there is no virus Scan like I've Seen Maybe on the s20 ?what's up with that ? Maybe Had it Been there I wouldn't have got hacked \"Bruteforce\" attacks.Malware Straight from Google pre-installed apps and security features off from the start. Should be the other way around. You have to go Deep ! My OS is Like Imei etc !3rd Party please Add a deep Scanning Tool Like for the S 20 !!. my Sim Card even after Changing numbers.TY",

            "Amasing.., just amazing. It is a great game with awesome music, and I have minor complaints that are just me, and don't really effect the gameplay. 1. Press start last coin is a pain 2.nock em, is way to hard to be a hard rating. 3. Power trip backwards wave is a little bit tricky, (I love it though.) 4. It is a lttle bit add-heavy. (But that is how you make money so...) and 5. Power trip 75% is annoying. Over all, this is just me being nitpicky, great game. Good job robtop! Eddit: (2.2 when?)",
            "This game is really Awesome! The Music, Effects, and more! My favorite level is Press Start, all people like press start because its has a really cool music. But the part that i hate in Press Start is the Last coin and that makes me hate the game :D Big thank you to the creators for creating this game! It cheers me up sometimes :)",
            "This game is epic. Most of the 1 star reviews are people complaining on how it's so hard, how their device isn't the problem: the game is, and how it's so messed. But in reality, they just need practise, their device is the problem and the reason it had lost of ads is because this is one of the free games in the franchise kept up by ads. I love this game and hate it when noobs say how terrible it is when all they nerd to do is practice. If at first you don't succeed, try try again.",
            "This game is soooooooooo fun and I'm not even joking. All of the levels are so hard but fun, all of the 1 star people are just noobs who aren't good at the game so they blame it on dumb reasons like oh when I press this it doesn't work, and stuff like that but in my opinion this game is really good and I'm enjoying it and I hope u do to",
            "This game is sooo cool!!I just love the way the intensity of the music builds. And the PRESS START.....the level starts calmly....and then...... BOOM! It becomes so intense!! Especially when the PRESS START suddenly pops up i get so excited! I love it. This used to be DanTDM's intro so its gotta be great. No wonder why Dan played this game so much. Every single geometry dash game is awesome. Thank you to the games' creaters who are so genius.Thank you so much!"

There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",

The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "I have never quit a game the same day i started it, until now. And odds are more money is made by the ads than the players. I was excited when i started playing too many bugs and bad choices by the devs or management however.",
            "Predatory gambling and political ads ruin what could have been a fun experience. Edit - Cookie cutter reply from Devs fails to address my concerns. Gameplay is good, predatory ads for malware or gambling are not.",
            "Beginnings are fun, but later it's unplayable for free users. Too many ads, repetitive, unjust, unfair. At some point, progressing is limited to paying customers, upgrading your ships above certain levels is available only after buying crystals or cards. You don't receive enough of them during normal game. Ads can break the sound in the game, and pause your music. Free users are limited to 20 games at a time. Then you need to wait for energy to replenish.",
            "I updated the app to this latest version and lost all my ship and drone upgrades!!! That sucked biiiiiiiig time and deserved 1/5. 🌟 But the compensation received in the in-app mail was more than enough and deserves a 5-star rating...have your 5/5 🌟 as a sign of gratitude from yours truly."

            "Overall, a good app, as it hardly affects anything, but the notifications are kind of annoying(to be more specific, the pne that says \"Please sign in your samsung account to continue using services securely\" or something like that. If you do see this review Samsung, please do allow the ability to mute notifications. But if that is not possible, i will just stick to the best settings i can. If a user has the same problems i have, i recommend turning importance to low in the settings for the app.",
            "TERRIBLE! this app is frequently (almost every minute) sending me a notification that the app is not working. I cannot delete the app, I cannot access its setting or permissions or notifications. It makes my phone crash at least twice a day. None of the phone shops can fix it, Samsung does not reply to my emails about it and I'm ready to go back to iPhone!",
            "Hijacks phone taking total control, forcing you to use samsung apps not allowing you to choose! Takes up most of storage on phone (over half used on phone and I only had it less than a month!) Tried to clear cache and data used by Samsung, force stop then next day are notifications of tracing, tracking and recording my phone and personal info!!! Why? And who gave permission??? NOT ME! My friend Samsung,! or \"dreamqltesq\" overrides permissions and retakes control AGAIN! HUGE TRUST ISSUS SAMSUNG",
            "I'd like to rate this as a 0.-100., i strongly suggest that you never use it. Mainly because it's associated to Chrome by google., and if you don't know what capability Chrome has i suggest you do your research. I used Samsung and it screwed my entire phone up. I thought it was me, screwing it up at first but later found out it was Samsung and chrome.",
            "Samsung account wants me to sign in all the time. There's a problem with that, I have updated my new phone number every where and removed the old one but Samsung acct wants me to verify by sending a code to my previous phone number. I don't have access to that number. Therefore, since Sam acct wants me to do this routine with everything I do online, it's limiting my use. So, I have no clue what I'm supposed to do. I have looked into it and have read there are many people having this problem."

            "This is my favorite truck driving game, good controls, challenging, lots of fun, the only bad thing is while you're driving the ads that pop up at the top of the screen and stay there while you're driving makes the game lag so bad you can't hardly control or play the game ,So if you could Please fix this problem, I would Definitely give 5 stars",
            "The game is okay. But there are a lot of ads. The controls are hard because they are so small. The triangles for turning are okay but they are tiny so it makes it harder. Half the time i try to hook up to a trailer the truck and trailer collide causing damage on the truck and it wont hook so i have to exit out of the game to reset it so hopefully the next time i watch 5 ads to get in it will hook to a trailer. The game iver all is fun but every time i stop to get fuel, at the scale, or to sleep",
            "When you try to hook up the load most of the time it acts like your hitting something or your truck just goes right threw the load, very frustrating!! And you can't see the red lights even when zoomed in, please fix these problems! Other than that great game, I will give 5 stars, when fixed, thanks.",
            "The gameplay is superb. But needs some improvement in graphics and make it a bit more realistic. The game also needs 6-lane roads and new places in the map. Overall this has the best handling among all the other simulators. Also, everytime I go to Nashville, I'm charged with a speed ticket, no matter how slow or how fast I am. I have been playing this since 2017 and still cant get enough. Although now a little bored with gfx and maps.",
            "Couldn't play the game for more than 15 seconds without an ad. And why would I want to pay for an ad free experience if I haven't had an opportunity to try the game. Also, the game requests access to contacts, and wants permission to make and manage phone calls which seems odd for a game like this."

            "Great game but there are SO MANY ADS! I'd gladly buy a full version to remove them but that isn't an option, meaning you get a 30-45 second ad after every few games, and anither 30-45 second ad if you want to unlock the perks for a round. That often adds up to over a minute of ads for (sometimes) only 30 seconds or a minute of gameplay.",
            "The game may be hard it is just it's fun it's just fun but still they need to work on the difficulty though like you can be a beginner and you can have the most trouble on one stage it's like hell but you'll get used to it like anybody else will get used to it I'm starting to get used to it I only got this game like yesterday so or last week I'm not sure I kind of forgot",
            "Not what I thought it was, just running through a field as long as you can. Yeah you get weapons and I even got a dog by my side on only my second run from having perks from watching the ad, but still not what I thought it was. Controls feel strange. Not buggy, but the turning/moving side to side is way too fluid. I know that's the point but that exactly why I dont like it :/",
            "Update didn't fix anything, it's WORSE. Sh_tty adware crashed the sound fx completely and won't let me ingame. Had to reinstall. I will NEVER play online again. Sounds still play after being dropped/new weapon pickup. Hardcore map still plays weapons NOT selected. Lame mission points overlap. Random weapons drop my ass. This game has the potential to be great, unfortunately it's mired in endless moronic grinding. Most aggravating is the \"instant death\" *Hates the noisy dog!!*",
            "If this game was my girlfriend, it would be a love hate relationship. Love the run and gun aspect, but some of the weapons suck. Main the beginner ones(except the shotgun) I hate getting a those weapons out of a box after having a good one. Once I've made it so far keep me going with the good guns. I guess there in lies the challenge. Ok I said enough. Love the game and keep up the good work. PS, Love you too beautiful."

            "I have used both paid and free photo editing apps, and I have to admit this photo editing app is absolitely Awesome in comparison to all the free and paid P.E.A. combined!! It has nothing to do with it being mosty free, which is up to you to pay, but with all the free options, I have no idea what's included with the paid version! A MUST DOWNLOAD!! ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!! Thanks so much for such an awesome Photo Editing App!! Keep up the AWESOME WORK!!",
            "besides the excessive ads and the impending fear of not being able to use the app at all (for the purpose I downloaded it for) thanks to the forceful hand of a monthly-paid membership,, this app works great. it's literally the only thing I've found where I'm able to edit moodboards the way I've been wanting to, so I thank it for that",
            "This app is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for like 2 years now. If you understand all the features (which are so many), you won't ever need any other photo editing app. It has no logos after making a collage or editing, great layouts , different sizes with ratios and options while making collage to crop , swap , delete , anything. You can choose the border or just have no borders. it's just awesome. Thanks for the app makers.",
            "Like flying for the first time. Like a pool on a hot summer day in Modesto. Like a cup of hot chocolate on Christmas. Like checking ALL the boxes on your daily to do list. Like having all the laundry folded after watching an episode of the magicians, except that towel you used to wipe your tears with. Like strawberry bingsu in loser angeles in August. Like hugging your mom. Like reaching Challenger in Starcraft. Like making before after pictures of when you finally clean. Like comment subscribe.",
            "Very nice app ...I accidentally uninstall this up and I almost cry ..good thing after searching for days I found it..this is very useful in making invitations..I just wish you add more text options, calligraphy,and color like gliter effect on text .good thing this is update new effects were add..kudos to the developer..keep up the good work."

            "Was a great app, but when one purchases an app outright in full, then later is asked to now pay/subscribe to use half the tools suddenly is not okay at all. I never have & never will use subscription services. If you had the option to buy a new upgraded version each year, I'd be ok with that. But to pull a \"re-pay\" stunt like that for existing customers, leads me straight to the exit on this. I will no longer be recommending this app to the vast amount of others I work with unless changed.",
            "I paid for this app in full to get the premium mode a year or so ago. Now it's asking me to pay for a new version. Go and get f***Rd. I actually loved this app and was my absolute preferred app for editing photos. You had to ruin it and get greedy shame on you. And do not bother commenting saying why don't you try the free 7 day trial... You've lost me as a customer seeya",
            "This app is trash! It just crashed on me. I unintalled. The reason I bought this app was to animate some charachters in gacha. If you plan to do that as well I do not reccomend it! Its too complex to even know how/where to use the chroma key (if there even is one), and it crashes way to easily for me. 1 star for me. Experience wasn't the best at all.",
            "EDIT: One problem is that adding an image downgrades the quality of that image a lot. REST: Honestly I think I hit the jackpot downloading this app first as an editing app. It has literally everything you could ever ask for in a photoshop app. The scene option at the very end is pretty fun to mess around with also. You can pay for premium, but that just gives you a few extra effects, atleast I think. Which means this is probably the best free editing app you can get out there right now.",
            "I used to luv this app.But when i started my subscription, the app started crashing. My subscription will end Nov 2020.Cant save an edited photo..it just keeps crashing.it's good i just subscribed for a month or else ive wasted my subscription fee for a longer period."

        "comments": [
            "I previously played when it was tied to Facebook. It was a good game then, but now it's a whole different game. The alliances, dragon rescue, etc. is fun. What ain't fun is the sheer number of dragons behind a pay wall (I stopped playing at the point they added legendary dragons), the amount pop ups before you can actually play the game with no way to skip all, having to click the \"feed\" button a hundred times, adds that come out of nowhere. There are a few more issues, but that's the majority.",
            "Love the game, but I hate that global chat was removed, we have chest cool downs, and I'm bombarded with ads. I used to watch ads for rewards, but these Yahoo ads are killin me. Now I'm even getting ads when I do basic things during the game, not choosing to watch the ad. Yahoo ads are annoying since I have to wait at least 50 seconds as well as periodically tap in order to finish the ad, but it was optional (watch ads for rewards). The game seems like it's dying out now..",
            "Right out the gate if you spend $30 and put it in the right area this game will be your favorite game. I truly feel that this game can be a game of the century but I don't like how everything costs so much money. if you're not careful you will nickel and dime yourself. It is an extremely fun and addictive game though and I wish they had it for console. There's a ton of variety a lot of different combinations of dragons mini games mini worlds and everything in between. Excellent game.",
            "So I love this game. I have since I was young. There are only one things I would like to address. The amount of ads u get when you first get on the game, maybe incorporate them into the game some way, but my whole family plays this also and hates the ads. Now I would like to suggest an idea. Therr should be a way to send gifts to your friends every day. Just one a day. And when u keep sending then it can increase ur friendship level and increase your rewards in ur gifts, ex. A dragon. Thank you!",
            "Love the game but as of the 4th of October, Australia started daylight savings and we accepted the fact that the event currency collection times moved from 4am, 12pm and 8pm (all EST), to 5am, 1pm and 9pm. It was an hour later, but we understood. However, recently for some reason, again the event currency collection times have shifted another hour later to, 6am, 2pm and 10pm. We are not enjoying this change and it is restricting us from getting the most out of the game. I hope it can be fixed."

Navigation to features is quite difficult to use and some sub menus where you wouldn't expect them, making taking a photo time consuming and difficult. Don't download it if you're looking to improve photo quality.",
            "It says the limit size is reached ...and I cannot play atleast a video with 30 seconds ....it was good when I first tried ...I could shoot for 23 mins ..but now it's a trash . And the quality has changed after 2 days I installed. ...I don't find a good quality camera .and I want my front camera to be as a mirror but when I take a photo it gets mirrored again ...the photo looks bad . I don't even have an app with a better camera ..can anyone recommend one for me? It's one one the worst app ...",
            "Not good for video, the adjustments for the video settings are right on top of the start/stop button, I couldn't make any adjustments for color temp or white balance, nothing in video mode. For still shots it's fine but look elsewhere if you want to shoot video.",

            "Its a great game, but with a game so simple how come there are so many glitches?? 5 consecutive levels freeze up during a stupid ad to where I have to back out of the game and reopen it! Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",
            "This game is awesome the problem is that it's too fast and then you get confused where you have to go fix that and you can equip the skin."

Sometimes I have no messages left to read but the icon quips alerting me that I have unread messages, and this is a trend that extends for other apps like calls. When can we see dng for the camera? And does sony will release the Photo Pro app for the previous Xperia 1/5?",

It was the first info to show up as the app loaded. Also, now it takes extra taps to check battery temperature. 2nd favourite feature. Good: the optimisation feature, I guess. Recommended actions don't look very smart. I'm rolling back to the previous version (4.8.2).",

It kept changing making the screen too dark when i was trying to look at something even when it was dark in the room. I switched it off as it was all wrong light when it was supposed to be dark and dark when i wanted it light. I now have my screen brightness set at 50% which is perfect."

            "I Installed this game after around 1 year, i thought this game is not p2w anymore but i was wrong this game is still filled heavily with p2w stuff, matchmaking system sucks, take my advice go ahead for call of duty mobile, there is no mean to play greedy gameloft's games where activision is giving you console like f2p games Really disappointed of gameloft",
            "The graphics are fairly good, and so as the story line but there is a major issue that is server. I could barely play a complete match before it says network lost even when I have Wifi router connection. I don't think it's network issue may be it's your server issues..."

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

            "Luv Galaga This game is awesome. I've had to figure it out all on my own. Still so many unanswered questions as to how to play the game and what everything means. And yes I've looked. I've done this fine that too. I'm thinking the game will get boring soon but ... When I played Galaga I could turn the machine over, I was a winner lol ... This one just seems too repetitive at every level. All reviews were helpful.",
            "Pay to win platform. Glitchy, and rewards not updated to recognize VIP levels. Unrealistic difficulty levels as one progresses through game. Over priced, and too many cheaters on platform. Update: cheaters are even worse, and now you can't report them. The last update made the ships weaker so you'll have to spend more money to even have a chance in campaign or pvp. The game is trash, and the developers suck.",
            "Great game. Only game that I play on my phone. But this latest update has made the game worse. In PVP i get paired to play an opponent that has lower level than me, by the time that I finish wave 1, the opponent is on wave 3. The bots are more difficult to kill for me, but the opponent still gets through waves fast. And i see he has weaker ships 🤷🏻‍♂️",
            "I have insalled 3 updates the last 3 weeks. Will not auto update even thought I have it set to do so. Two weeks in a row that it is \"Boss Friday\" and it only shows up once in a while. Missed last mini-game for unknown reasons, it just was not there. Constant issues and never get answers when I contact devs. The game is grest when it works right but that serms to be less and less causing me to lose interest.",
            "Awesome game. Killer graphics! The levels just keep getting better! Download it now! Note: Not a compensated endorsement! I'm a real person & not a not nor anything like , I don't know the devs. I'm telling you this as my own opinion."

            "The game is fun and addicting, I just wish the choices didn't cost so much, I realize money has to be made, but it would be nice if there was an option to get more than 10 a day for a VIP pass. UPDATE: I still enjoy the game, however it would be nice if once you played through a story, you didn't have to use tickets to go through it again or use more gems to get hairstyles or clothes or pick choices you already made.",
            "I liked the stories but it gets expensive very quickly (I could buy several books with the costs) and you can't change the gender of your character. It was set to female and that was my only choice. The ad I clicked on showed a gay storyline but none of the story choices were that type. I'm a little confused. I also purchased the vip package but saw no benefit from it. Not really sure what I paid for. Still spent a ton on gems, had to buy outfits, hairstyles, experiences, and keys.",
            "Now don't get me wrong the storylines are awesome,they're steamyinteractive but the price of the gems are ridiculous! Now I've downloaded this game I've given it at least a week before I made a judgment on it to actually post a review but it's ridiculous the amount of money that needs to be spent in order to have a good choice or a good ending........ So it keeps the reader interested, it is too much money I understand that you guys need money to keep the game running but it shouldn't be THIS",
            "I love the storyline but like others have said, it's hard to get diamonds. It gives you options but you can't afford the premium options. I think you should be awarded more than 1 diamond for reading a 10-15 minute story. I would love to finish but I'm afraid I may have to uninstall this because at the rate I'm going, I will not get finished. Plus when you click to try to speed up or add diamonds, the game locks up and you lose where you were and you don't get rewarded.",
            "So far I love this app but gems are very useful and I have barely enough for anything. And the fact that you have to buy clothes that you already have. So gems need a big upgrade like come on it really needs it. I love the story that I am in and I think that's it the best but it judges you if your clothes aren't good enough 😕 and some of the best things cost so much gems its unbelievable. So I am on Lessons on Lust or something and I wanted to do the threesome with Gemma but its costs to much."

            "It seems to work well. I'm using it on a Pixel 4a, which only lets you know about it when the message or email actually comes in. If you frequently leave your phone unattended, it's nice to be able to know at a glance that something happened while you were out, and the little light around the camera cutout does that. After trying unsuccessfully to get it to work, I found a website that showed what each setting should be. Worked fine after I did that, and I can always tweak it later if I want.",
            "The Samsung Galaxy S10 series doesn't have any visual notification options, so I downloaded this app to help me prevent missing texts, calls and reminders. Obviously, when the phone is with me, I see each event happening. If I stepped away, however, I'd have to pick up the phone or double-tap it each time to see if I missed anything. Because I was used to my old phone displaying notifications, I'd forget to check and miss out on important events. This app saves the day... most of the times...",
            "I'm having problems with the light notification. I only want the light to come on when I receive any kind of notification. But when I switch off the screen (not locking the phone) the light still comes on (despite there being no notifications). I find I have to constantly switch the AOD settings on and off to try and solve the problem. But it hasn't worked. Please advise what the issue is.",
            "It took a bit of setting up, (there are a lot of options!) but it does a really good job. Very happy with this, and the writer responds quickly to email queries. Added bonus some good live wallpapers included. Well worth the money for the premium version. So, recommended for my fellow light flashy-liker people. 😃",
            "What's new is essentially a feature list, not what's new in the update. Two MAJOR needs now that I've been using for a bit. It REALLY needs to stop the edge stuff if notifications go away. If they are dismissed automatically, this stays blinking even with nothing to look at. Example is if an email is read elsewhere and the mail app dismisses its notification for it. Second is if it could vibrate when notification comes in, this would answer a number of topics I'm trying to resolve."

When I try and go to \"My Page\" I keep getting \"SERVER ERROR (0) TRY AGAIN LATER\" I HAVE \"TRIED AGAIN LATER\" FOR OVER A YEAR! FIX YOU APP! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR PRE-INSTALLED SOFTWARE TO NOT WORK ON PHONES THAT COST $1,299.99! UNACCEPTABLE! I have had my Note 20 Ultra since release and after contacting Samsung MULTIPLE TIMES. It STILL DOES NOT WORK! UNACCEPTABLE!",
            "Still no resolution over 4 months: Displays my galaxy s20plus warenty is rejected after review using this app. I called Samsung multiple times to have this corrected and they still don't have any idea how to fix this. They say my warenty should not be rejected. This is very disturbing my warenty status still showing its rejected since the beginning of July and no one at samsung knows what to do to fix the samsung members app?? This shouldn't be so difficult to correct.",
            "Why doesn't this app help with finding my phone via chat as my phone can't be reached? I was told to stay online as he was rerouting me to someone that can help, that was 30 minutes ago so I copied it all as no way to get a transcript.",
            "Hardware test may be useful, but I would trust 3rd party software more. otherwise I find this app mostly useless. I said it in 2017 and I'm saying now in 2020.",
            "Many thanks to Samsung for creating such a beautiful app. The Galaxy Store is even more beautiful than the Play Store. But the Galaxy Store needs more big updates. So that everything can be found beautifully in one search."

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "I don't understand what's the complaint regarding some colours needed to pay $. Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enough🤔🙄🤬😤🧐🙃😒😠👎👈",
            "Even though I know it costs alot of money for myself its worth every penny! Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off 🤔 And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself 😊 Jackie"
