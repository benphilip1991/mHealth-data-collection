            "I gave it four stars because it gives videos yes but it doesn't give it in all the levels. Because in level 14 and 20 I got videos but I looked down and I never see anymore so I was thinking that it wasn't so bad that's why I gave it four stars and that's not all when I turn on my internet connection again it started to freeze up horbley",
            "It's an okay game. Too easy for adults but I'd say inappropriate for children since there's bdsm subjects. Graphics aren't amazing and there are indeed some ads but if you're looking for a time killer game this is it. It's as advertised, and good enough for 3 stars",
            "I got up to the last board, then even though I was doing everything right the game wouldn't let me go on and win. It just froze and that's it. So frustrating. So now I'm boycotting every game from the maker"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I loved playing this. It seems this game has multiple locations you can visit and play them at different levels; there are 4 levels. The 1st location is free. While the other locations are not. You need to buy the rest of the locations. In-game coins make this easy. The one thing that i did not like is it is not a completely offline game. Some of the perks needs internet for you to use it. I don't know if it was just mine. The hand drawn maps was only for the 1st location.",
            "I really like this game! The only issue I have is that every time I play, a pop-up appears that says that the game requires Google Play Games, I think it's called, whenever I click on one of the chapters. I don't have any trouble playing the game itself, it's the Google Play Games pop-up that's annoying me. You should be able to play a free game without being harassed about downloading a separate app when you can still play the game without it.",
            "It's really thrilling and scary and so cool at the same time well the first time I play I thought the girl has a body and the head icon is the only one to be there but when I saw her I died well it's still COOL love this game so all of them are just head and there's a dog too and more challenging options this gotta be the best game cool really cool and the girl with only a head was really unexpected 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best game i love horror games too well this one is thrilling",
            "100% great just that when you make a ghost can you add an option to save the creation and can you make the characters/maps all play able for free I wouldn't want to spend money (not an fake review",

            "Wow, this is a great game! Idk y people are saying it's bad and it lags. Well I can give some tips: Switch on airplane mode, it will stop and and prevent lag. Also whenever you are going to a new level, close the game open it again and press the next level. Do this for about 3-4 times and lag will reduce. I followed all these steps and now it's very smooth! Also you have to feel the beat in the game, and go accordingly. I mix sounds and audio, so I'm good at that. Great time killer and gr8 game!",
            "This game used to be great, I hate to say this but now it is horrible! The game gets to about level 8 then on level 9 u get to the last part and guess what, it freezes! I tried redownloading it, restarting my phone, and going in and out of the game but nothing worked! Dont waste your time playing for 2 minutes, freezing then wasting more time trying to get it to work.",
            "I love this and all and I love the app, but why 1 star? Well it is simple, I love this before, BUT then it all got laggy and stuff. And also, it freezes in your screen, sometimes even my phone would glitch and my phone is FREAKING BRAND NEW!! And so, I give it 1 star cause of that, sometimes it also stops popping out any balls. I keep clicking yet, nothing is coming out. So if you wanna play this, go a head, but I wouldn't so I am just deleting it. If the glitch and freezing isn't there, 5 star.",
            "This is an amazing game, but what frustrates me a lot is the extreme lag i get whenever I open up the game and start playing a level. You may not get as much lag if you have a phone or tablet with VERY good connection.",
            "The game is a really cool and fun concept but theres so many ads. Everytime you complete a level an ad pops up. I use to have this game and it use to run great little to no lag and it had a few ads but it wasnt constant."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "I give this a 1 out of 5 because it's not fair. They NEVER give an accurate match rate when your icing the cake, and they always out WAY too much confetti on it so yours looks even more different from the original. This makes me really mad and I'm uninstalling :)",

Though one thing I would improve is there are some pictures that no matter what I do, I can't get 3 stars. It always comes up as 2 1/2 even if it looks good. Other than that, I love it! Definitely better than when it first started!",
            "This is a fun, interesting, enjoyable, artistic, and creative game! I like picking techniques to use for each tattoo. I am finding this game to be somewhat addictive as well. One of my friends plays too, so sometimes I also send her screenshots of what I make. The different tatoos are interesting and make me laugh!",
            "I would be giving it 5 stars except for 1 VERY ANOYING thing.. Its bad enough when you get bombarded by ads from a game but what really upsets me the most is with NO warning at all an add will start right in the middle of you drawing or filling in a spot and when the ad finishes and comes back to the game the gun goes haywire and messes up the whole picture and you have to start all over or also in the middle of drawing or filling the settings menu will keep popping up and doing the same thing.",
            "Very nice app/game, I thoroughly loved it. Very nice graphics, controls and as the levels were increasing the drawings were getting harder and harder to play. If you are finding a game of Tattoos 🎮📱then I would prefer this game to play or download. Thanks LION STUDIOS for giving/creating this beautiful app. THANKS A LOT!🙂🙏 REALLY LOVED THIS GAME!❣️🙏👍👍💫👌✨",
            "I love the game however I got 2 stars out first cause there's a glitch that we put it right and it puts an angry face. Second cause when I sometimes start the game it's normal but then when i click things it doesn't bring me to the ink tattoo tasks. Please fix those bugs"

            "SUPPORT experience is horrible. The response is always like \"we are not able to process this\", \"unfortunately we cannot help on this\", \"we have reviewed your case but unable to offer anything further\" etc. It's very difficult to Earn Golds and majority of items in game (about 80%) requires Gold to buy while the other 2 currencies (Cash and Medals) are hardly in need but are offered plenty through various Events. Overall you have to put in lots of money and time into this game for nothing.",
            "This is very good game. If you want to top in this game you must have gold and bucks. You have to collect gold by tapjoy and also need some purchase. This game grafics are good. And control is also good. Gun upgrading is necessary. When you purchase a weapon you have to upgrade full. This is a good game.👍👍👍",
            "I played the game for 2 years and spent a lot of money in it, literally you have to buy everyhting from here even energy to play when it should be free, each target is 2 or 3 energies and it cost money too if you go to alliance war you have to shoot almost 22 hours straight non stop to get in a good place and you get rewards rhat after 3 or 4 weeks you dont anymore and you have to keep buying guns to level up. I only give this game 1 star rate because all of the money you have to spend",
            "Lots of micro transactions to go with all the ads. You need to upgrade your weapon almost every mission and they get a delay before going into effect. I saw 40 minutes with a rank 2 weapon, can't imagine what it would be with higher ranked weapons. Unless of course you use more micro transactions to skip the time. Seems like you spend more time waiting than playing",

I got a new phone and my new phone won't allow me to sign into my existing account even when I sign in with the same Google and Facebook account. I am not starting over on this game. Very frustrating your system won't allow me to get my account back between phones!"

To make it more worse it takes TOO MUCH TIME TO MAKE MY OWN SLIME. Another thing that there is little star below which goes to a place with Guess The Slime n Painting, whenever I choose Guess the slime, it automatically changes chosen colour by the correct colour. So, I'll just request to improve the things I've mentioned above. Also it's a good app",

            "The game decides today, 22 Oct 2020, that from now on, instead of ads, I have to use gems to buy a spin after a loss on a level. But of course, I don't have any gems and gems cost real money. And, there's no way to earn gems through game play, so no more free spins! We'll see what happens from here, but I may be deleting this game.",
            "Good game. Few things I didnt like was it forces me to use my extra help options on the beginning of the game. Or even forces me to use boost energy at the start when I dont even need it! They only give you three gems so you would buy the boost energy but it costs 6 gems!! I tried to end game so that I wouldnt have to buy it with my gems. But then it forces you to use your gems to continue. Level 24.",
            "Please add the new features in the next update of the game, game data save with social accounts and improvements on UX design like the main lobby display with the fresh new look! And one more thing please add more characters in this game. Next, please label the game levels with colourful background with difficulty indicator on the level number for example, no indicator for easy levels, skull indicator for hard levels and horned skull indicator for super hard levels just like Candy Crush Saga do",
            "After progressing to a certain level, the game gives you colours that you can't use to complete the level. You also don't have enough balls, sometimes by just 1/2 short of what you need. If these problems aren't resolved, I feel to delete the game due to it's frustrating set up!",
            "This game used to be fun. Now I am forever stuck on level 644, because you are only given 25 balls. It is impossible to pass this level with only 25 balls. Help on you tube show 37 balls. You can pass with 37 balls. Fix the game. Fix level 644. Is there any support anymore for this game? Are there to be anymore updates? If not, why?"

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."

            "Game is old and repetitive. Mission levels are too easy. Play free world one time for about 6 min and you'll collect enough money to buy all 5 dinosaurs they offer. That's right, 5. FIVE dinosaurs... that's all they offer. There were literally thousands of different species of dinosaurs that roamed the earth and they let u pick from 5... what a joke. In fact as I write this review I'm changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars just cause of this lack in options.",
            "This game has fairly poor graphics and the game play is middle of the road. The real problem however is that the game is extremely lagy and tries to trick you at the very beginning into spending your money on unlocking all the dinosaurs. If this wasent bad enoughf there are ads almost every minut (most you can't skip). I gave this 2 stares because at least there are missions you can do, and the idea behind the game has some creativity. But the poor game play and ads ruin the game.",

I LIKE IT...<>",

            "Okay I buy this when I was nine and right when I got in it I freeked out I saw a man with a thing on his mouth I did play this I was not scared first i read the comments about this game...But Im vary dumb kids do not buy it.My legs shaked when I saw his eyes 0-0 Just do not buy this game pls!!♥",

            "The game is nice and clean but only till level 65-70. After that game become too tuff for you to control, there should be a way to control things. Imagine the game level after 100. On top of it, too many unnecessary ads making the game not that awesome.. But that's what you get for playing free these days. No option to exit from the game, you have to end the task to get out from it. Hope developer will work in games longevity and UI.",
            "Awesome, fun little game to pass some time, when needed. There are some ads, but if you are ALSO playing this game to kill some time, then who cares? Everybody's gotta make some $$ somehow. The real bonus here is, if you have to close the game immediately, it's no big deal. (As opposed to other games where it affects certain things if you have to suddenly quit)",
            "Hey guys, want a game where you play for ten seconds and then have the option to watch 2 1/2 minutes of ads everytime? Then this is the game for you! For real though, game is trash, just an ad dump. Horrible, horrible product from something they could have actually been fun.",
            "Even after paying to remove ads, you're still seeing ads all the time. Any other game like this when you pay to remove ads they are completely removed. With this one it just removes a few. You're still slapped with ads if you want the multiplier, if you want to use the super slap, and if you want to claim the skin and super slap you just unlocked. Not worth your time or money.",
            "Loads of sick fun. The graphics are crude but I probably wouldn't want them realistic. No complaints about the controls, and the motions of the avatars twirling, getting dizzy, beat up looking, even your own, are nice to help keep it real. Reminds me of punch contests in Jr. High, trying out new muscle. Take turns shocking each other in the bicep, showing off how much you could take as well as give."

            "There are so many ads. And there a impossible levels so that you have to watch ads manually to skip the level. They also need to add more stages because once you get far enough into the game you just repeat previous levels. I have seen every level at least 3 times each. But the overall gameplay and idea is amazing, and the repeating levels dont bother me much, which is why i am 2000 levels into the game. 3/5",
            "TOO MANY ADS. I like the gameplay but an ad every 10 secs (some even un-skippable) kind of breaks the flow and makes a good game disengaging. I think it would be better to decrease the frequency of the advertisements and let the user immerse more in the game than the advertisements...",
            "This game is great I love the modern pixel graphics that is my favorite part and who ever doesnt like this game probably didnt try it yet because they would love it right from the start.",

            "The game was amazing. But when I hit level 12 it did not let me go to the next level. I played level 12 about 5 times. It only let me play levels 1-12. Then it said that I have to rate the game. When I rated the game, I went to the game to play again. But it said I have to rate but I already did. So I deleted the review and decided to write a really mean review. IF YOU WILL REGET IT. PLEASE DO NOT GET THE GAME.",
            "At first this game was really fun, but then when i finished level 12 it asked me to rate it and there was no \"later\" option as there usually is so i rated the game and when i got back to the game to continue playing, i had to do the level all over again, so i did, and then the same thing happened after i finished the level for the second time. I am so angry. Defenitly deleting the game.",
            "I love this game. Because of quarantine I have a lot of free time and this game helps m kill that time. I love that the ads are somewhat limited. The only thing I don't like is that is makes you watch an ad when you got the help buttun. Would definitely recommend 😉",
            "Really good game. Excellent puzzles to solve 'em swiftly. So many details, so many colors and numbers. That's fine. Grafphic is 4/5, can be better, but that's ok. It is really funny to solve so many puzzles. But actually, there' re too less rooms, only 12. Am waiting for the next upd.",
            "This is game is fun! Why? -because you can use your minds to solve many things and can play this game offline! What do you learn from it? -you learn many ways on life basics especially on how to do something or try to escape something. You learn many things and also this game helps you revise on what you do at school like knowing the numbers on the clock or auditioning number combinations you unlock this draw! You must download this app !"

I hope you can add game modes too, will be waiting for sone surprise in the next update. See yaa!",
            "I think that Modern Ops is the more superior fire strike because the money you get in FS is miniscule compared to Modern Ops 500. I think that the upgrade system is way better than the FS upgrade system. The only thing that I what is the bots to be better because they basically just give th opposing team points. But sometimes I'll get a full group of real players and it makes it a real challenge.",

No matter what weapon i select to use, it now defaults to a random weapon and if you select to use a machine gun or sniper rifle, the game defaults to a hand gun most times or a shot gun. I deleted the game, re installed it. I also restarted my phone and same thing! Developers please fix this as soon as possible or you will be loosing paid players.",
            "I love the game so far so good, but I dont get gold somethings wrong. I look at my brothers screen and he has gold but when i look at my screen it doesnt say any gold. Please when you fix the gold bug issues, I'm not asking for much but i just want 3000 gold. Thats all because i want the FN Scar. Thank you so much for reading this. My USER: ShadowEddie",
            "Just what the hell, just played it for the first time and disappointed, everytime i shoot the enemy they don't even die and i die first, after you die u can see the enemy's status during that but i fired all my magazines and he's still in 100% HP , like i try it on everyone, still the same, i get 2-3 kills every round, i can kill players whenever i switch my weapons, but still disappointed"

The game itself is functional and has a few songs to play, but there is 500 others like that on the market that don't behave like scams. Oh by the way uninstalling will not unsubscribe you, you have to go to the play store->hamburger menu->subscriptions. Yes I know the first three days are free. It is still a joke.",

            "At first when I saw the reviews I thought they we're lying. But once I installed it, is said Free Trial 67.98/month! Please fix your game developers. And also warning for the people that want to install it. *SCAM ALERT! DO NOT BUY!*",
            "***SCAM ALERT*** The app is a scam,It will not continue until you subscribe to its annual subscription which is about $50 US, This app shouldn't be on the app store. Its something different to give a trial version, but not letting you continue without subscription, thats some next level scam. Let the user decide if they want all the features."

Gameplay is good, fun concept, but with the frequency of ads (after every two attempts which are short by nature) you can spend more time watching ads than playing (and not an exaggeration as so many reviews do). Ads are fine for free games, far too many reviews complain about them, but in this case they are excessive.",
            "It is an amazing game and i really do recmend it at first it can be easy but levels later it starts to get hard do not listen to other people that say the game is boring no it is not boring but SUPER FUN. I do not like that there are a lot of ads but i recomend it",

            "I don't understand what's the complaint regarding some colours needed to pay $. Yes, the devs need to earn $ but at least, they offers the basic colours for free and some colours free just by voting daily. All-in-all, it's a fun and relaxing app for most adults that loves to colour and also, it's useful for device that uses S-Pen or stylus. 5-star from me.",
            "Colorfy is good....very good, VERY nice drawings to color.... Lots of options from animals to buildings, famous landmarks and gorgeous landscapes.... However, i find the price WAAAY too steep $24 a month or $99 a year, is not even the Amazon and Disney Plus subscription combined...... I AM TRULY SORRY!!! ...but for that kind of money i can buy a few coloring books a month.... Yes is convenient, yes it provides very nice images and colors.... But the price is too much.",
            "I think the game is great! The fact you can even create your own picture is amazing although I do think it's a little ridiculous that you have to pay so much money to just get a few extra pictures and colours. Over all the game is awesome and is a fun way of colouring!",
            "I love these color game, I will. Subscribed very soon, I was in another coloring book game, and I deleted becouse I was not satisfied the way they treated Me there... They always log Me out and deleted most of my Arts work.. so I decided to deleted that lousy coloring game is Recolor the name of that lousy place .. most of the time I got my account with those lousy people log_out and my pictures and most of my Arts work they also deleted too, so I told myself enough is enough🤔🙄🤬😤🧐🙃😒😠👎👈",
            "Even though I know it costs alot of money for myself its worth every penny! Because I have a hard time relaxing especially befor bedtime.Colorfy completely puts me in a good head space Im able to be calm & create pictures that spometimes I can't believe I pulled off 🤔 And when you have others on Colorfy who like and comment on how much they like your art it makes you feel good about yourself 😊 Jackie"

            "This is the cutest game I've ever played! I even have the other game: My Talking Angela! Yesterday Angela turned 5 years old on My Talking Angela! I think the same thing will happen on My Talking Tom 2! I love Talking Angela sooooo much! Even though people say there's a man in her eyes, I never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever see the man. Talking Angela is sooooo cute!",
            "So I was playing I noticed a vid that came up on YouTube ig was on the news too so I went to check it out and when I came back at first I didn't believe it then wen I got back I saw that the makeup was off her face and floating in the air. I when back where you download it and then saw the pictures of a man in her eyes. I went to go crash my phone the I heard something in the woods so I looked the doors around my house. Then my sister was asleep and I fall asleep too.",
            "Omg literally I just played this from I year and I was playing and I notice that the app is haunted but I love the cat so what just happened is that I just open the app today and angela eyes were red and It was like someone is there behind her and I just ran that time to show that to my parents and there was no one in the chair but I though that it may be some problem of phone and I told hi angela she told hi I am a devil ,i am a devil,and that time i was very scared and i dont want to keep that",
            "I haven't played this game yet I did this ad before I started and going in the game but I heard it's very creepy and if you zoom into the eye then you can see a manner something then yeah I just look on YouTube and I saw a bunch of pictures I mean and then I see that someone is watching you when you play the game so I'm very scared to start of the game right now so yeah wish me good luck so I won't die okay",
            "I was playing and I noticed that there was something or someone in her eye. I saw some things that looked like an and a couch. I screenshoted the eyes and saw those. I thought it was really creepy. I instantly deleted the game after I discovered the things in the eyes. Kids don't download this game without your parents. I think the person that made the game was the person in the eyes. I rate this 1 star cause I thought it was creepy and uncomfortable having someone just staring at you, thats all"

I haven't received a reply from customer service when I reported the bugs either. I guess its time to stop playing this game. A total rip off when you invest so much time, energy recharges and game money to play the events.",
            "Was 5 stars... But with this new update, my game is laggy and damn near impossible to get on whether im on data, wifi, or both! Surgeries are especially laggy. I have amazing connection with all other apps! I spend money on this game and havnt been able to properly play due to this \"connection issue\" since the latest update! Not a happy customer.",
            "PLEASE FIX THIS. On the Tasks where I have to recharge the energy of my staff members, it does not count up correctly. Per say, if I recharge 5 of my staff's energies, within a short amount of time the task showing how many I have recharged will decrease in value AND even go into the negatives or not even count them at all! This includes the side Tasks and also the Disaster Tasks! Also on a side note, why did you decrease the Stamina given from 100 down to 25? Will lower the stars if no fix!",
            "Latest update is broken. Paramedic had 150 énergy before update and now its just 50, most of the common staff who has like 125-150 energy have lost 100 points and are at 25 and 50. Ads are now showing up more often but the ads for golden heart is still not in place. It takes forever to load. Ad count per hour or so are linked to all places even for energy buffs, please fix all these.",
            "Not impressed with the latest update where most of my staff lost their training level and the amount of energy/stamina they had. Going from 175 to 75/125 to 25 etc, so training level 3/4 all the way back to level 1. I was already getting bored and only logging on here and there because I no longer enjoyed doing the exact same procedures over and over again, so if this is something that isn't fixable I am definitely uninstalling the app which is sad because I put money into this game."

            "You will probably give up on some levels because you have no clue. Might even watch a hint still be unsure. Always room for improvement! It's rewarding when you figure it out. The physics overall work well, I had a few issues where the peices glitch through eachother. But it's rare and just requires a restart. No big deal. The levels start off easy, now I'm skipping some levels because I can't figure it out. If you want a challenge. Try this game. It's a lot of fun.",
            "I love this game. Starting off drawing shapes to move balls around the screen, the game developes, becoming a balancing act of inginuity, precision and skill, without adding any additional mechanics. The level design is tight, teaching ideas organically, without becoming impossible, but hArd COrE GaMerS can enjoy trying over and over for full stars. The ads aren't infuriating, and although the objects can clip, it's rare enough to be funny, instead of infuriating.",
            "\"Gravity, to Copernicus, is the nostalgia of things to become spheres.\" - Annie Dillard ....... Sometimes an itch comes along that you just have to scratch. Impressed so far - still rather early in my experience of the game - but thinking a stylus would be quite helpful. Thanks to the developers.",
            "It used to be an rxcellent brain trainer that fotces you to think outside the box. Now it's broken because it wants to force use of \"Google Play Games\" library to \"enhance experience\" with useless tie-in with farcebook and other useless social stuff. Uninstall as broken. I corrected, it wasn't \"some games library\" it's \"Google Play Games\". It forces me to the Google Play app to install it. I can provide screenshot.",
            "I love it! It does not rush you, if you get it wrong you haven't wasted hours, only seconds.At the moment I feel educated, and with a greater appreciation for physical objects. On Premium you can delete it when you get angry, then reinstall months later unchanged, no penalty. You need a precision stylus if you use it on mobile phone (I must get one!) . The 'hints' and 'restart' buttons are badly placed for right handers, you can accidentally press them during play, I wish I could move them."

            "I love how easy the steps are and the voice that gives you helpful tips during your exercise. Also love that it is a fast exercise. Im a busy mom of 3 kids. Hard to find time to workout. Especially with a 5 month old baby. My only issue is that there are reminders that go off 2 times a day to do the buttocks workout and you cant delete them. There is only 1 workout per day so why does the reminders go off 2 times a day to work out? Are you supposed to do the same workout twice?",
            "I love this app. Ever since I went to 7th grade I felt more down then now. Now that I'm in 8th grade I have shown a big improvement in my lower waist. Hour glass got it. Better curves got it. This app can do everything thats right for your body weight. I way 78 pounds and soon more Because I use a calorie app but this isn't about that. So I advise you to just download the app, I promise you won't regret it. 😀",
            "When I first installed the app, it was great. You can access to any excercise just by looking at an ad. After 3 or 4 days, I can't unlock new excercise anymore. No ads popping up. What does that mean? That indicates me to buy premium version? Edited : Turned out to be because of my weak wifi signal. It's all good now. Thank you.",
            "Simple design. Extremely user friendly. Love the video links for the exercises are unsure of and the tips that are given to help add difficulty or diet improvements. Graphs easy to understand so you know your progress and you will see progress. Results are guarantee. Love app so much would downloaded any app from this developer (& do!!) Whatever they're doing, keep it up. I tell everyone who will listen or follows my Facebook. Word of mouth is powerful thing and priceless when have good product.",
            "Big fan of my new big booty. I love how easy this app is to use! It's for all levels of exercise, if you feel it's too easy, just double the work outs to make it more effective. The workouts change daily to help challenge muscle memory and work all the muscles. There's daily reminders that can turn on/off, there's a work out guide that explains how to do the skills, keeps you on track so you do the exercises at an effective rate, & intermittent tips to remind you to fix your posture /position. ❤"

If anyone see ,I wrote all of those . U can try it . I write so many things . Give it a comment . I want to see . And that's why I love this app.😊",
            "Great app if you want to do some doodling or if you have a great drawing idea you can draw it on there so you remember for when you actually do it with a proper pro art app, but trying to do professional art on that app isn't possible (or it's just really hard) it's awesome to keep kids entertained with but has its cons but for what the game is made for it's awesome",
            "Its really fun to right your name then to plus then right your siblinings name! then do some hearts everyone the save it then go to gallery then boom it looks super cute! and as everyone else is saying i wish theres no adds and i wish u can pick your color of your brush but still have a option if you want rainbow! But everything else awesome game! Perfect if you don't have internet where ever your going! ♡",
            "This was so good it had all the effects for doodling like glowing neon colours its been like five days since I downloaded this app and I have made like 15 drawings that are extremely beautiful i loved this app and if you love editing glowing neon colours or sparkles I would recommend you to download this app it was very fun to draw in this ✨",
            "This is a great app, not just for kids. I enjoy making some fun doodle too. And i like it can play back the drawing process. If one can choose to share just the image or the drawing process video, it will then be 5 star app."

The description is one of the best you will read.",

(Some bugs) they walk the cell screen until I change it to LIGHT BLUE.--They stop walking! Or walk the perimeter of the screen and avoid to L. Blue. This app is the Agar for bugs. Awesome! Developer: Can you program a few buttons to Recall the wavelenghts saved? Thank you so much!",
            "It works... The ads kill the vibe from time to time... But that's why it's free. Unless you have different colored LEDs on your phone. The color change occurs in the screen. Taking showers with the lights off with a colored screen light on... Definitely sets a mood. But the white light from the ads kill the vibe.",

            "i cant say i didn't expect it to make my flashlight shine different colors except white, but you shouldn't mislead people into thinking the flashlight itself would change colors and not just the screen. if you want your flashlight to be a different color then use a marker on clear tape and put it over the light."

            "Definitely NOT unlimited. From what I have read the app uses some algra rhythm to determine how many books you can listen to a month. Sometimes I am able to listen to 6, sometimes they cut me off at 4. Very frustrating. They even take the books away if you have downloaded them and make you wait until your next payment goes through. I wish they offered a truly unlimited option for the audio book portion..I would definitely pay more for truly unlimited access",
            "This monthly fee is so worth it....no late fees if you don't read the book fast enough, read without worrying about a due date, read on my phone (super convenient) and about 85% of the books I've searched for I've found (some were even books that people personally uploaded). Lately the app has been buggy. There's an option to categorize your book titles. I would like to eventually see all my titles moved only into that specific list.",
            "Can't say enough good things about this app. For $9.99 a month, I have access to at least 75% of the books I have searched for. (That estimate may be too low,) Some are audio books, some are ebooks. Sometimes I have access to both audio and ebook for the same title. Magazines, articles, and so much more. In the time of Covid, I was waiting 2-3 months for ebooks and audiobooks from my library and spending a fortune for ebooks from that site that starts with an A. SCRIBD IS GREAT.",
            "I am a big book nerd but I hate buying books online (no local bookstore) without getting to look through them. This app solves this issue! Most books I start on here, I end up buying a hard copy of. The subscription fee is totally reasonable especially since they offer lots of audiobooks. After looking into other apps, glad I pick this one.",
            "The app works great. I wish the service would just be upfront that there's a limit on non-librivox audiobooks. When they just throttle searching it makes it look like there catalog is inconsistent, and it's just generally a sneaky way to handle it. I'd much rather know the limit and budget it, just like it is with library based services."

            "The game has improved dramatically. Highly recommended if you have the dedication required for leveling up. Completely free to play, all weapons are available free to use excluding skins which can be easily obtained by completing challenges. Very competitive ranked scene. Loads of fun. Also, the amount of hackers in this game is next to zero. I've encountered 2 in my 3 years of playing this game.",
            "Perfect game feels very light and smooth, has been improved drastically through updates it is way lighter and a lot more fun than other games out there. Just one issue is that unlocking skin is very tough but that doesn't make much difference in the fun part as skin doesn't give you skill every player has equal chance. You Should Definitely Try It, Play 2-3 Matches and You'll Love it.",
            "This game is great. If you don't have a PC but want to play Csgo well you're in luck. This game is enjoyable and can be hard but once you find the controls you are good with, you will be playing better than other new comers in no time. Also be aware that this is a 3D first person only shooter so it can get quite competitive (as you can probably guess).If you do get bored of custom games play ranked. Ranked is all about showing your skills and winning matches . Remember crouch when you shoot!😁",
            "The most important game you need to download! The graphics and not just graphics! But the game its so amazing, trust me guys you gonna enjoy this game forever and also nice job critical force! And i hope youll some more improvements at this game (niether wise i havent seen a bugs at this version anymore!) Otherwise all that i can say is i love this game I've been playing this game for allmost 3years and also goodluck and be safe guys!"

            "The game is bugged. I've been stuck on the same level without being to progress for several weeks. Ads are terrible. They're between every round and then some. I paid to remove them because the game is entertaining enough to want to be able to play but not 45 minutes after I paid to remove ads I haven't been able to play the game anymore. The ad I saw and downloaded it from showed the game being more complex than it actually is. It's just repetitive of the exact same things.",
            "Ad before a level. Ad during a level. Ad after a level. Ad to get tools. Then after you get the too, yep you guessed it, ANOTHER AD!! The ads are nearly twice the length that the levels are! This isn't a game but a place for adverts. If you want people to actually enjoy this game then perhaps have an ad after every two to three levels. Ads ads ads. This game is not enjoyable! Uninstalling!!",
            "I don't get ticked off by ads, the game is great but I have two requests. One: More decor, furniture, and the other one. One stopped at 20 , the other 21 and I haven't finished the other one. Another thing: Level 43. When I started, I cut open the aubergine and saw nothing. It's still screaming, there's no tweezers, and when you touch it, it zooms in. Please fix this!",
            "There are way too many adverts for this game to even be playable. I think I got four levels in and on all four levels there was an advert before, during and after the level, then to get new tools, guess what? Another advert. Then to get decor for your office? Another advert. I get in, free games have adverts, but I should spend more time watching them than playing the game. And I only got to level 4 because I kept telling myself not every level will be like this. EVERY LEVEL IS LIKE THIS.",
            "I got up to level 46 but I cannot go further for a bug won't let me get into my next tool. However there are many bugs that are good as well. Turning your internet off will not only get rid of all ads, you can still press \"watch ad to claim\" on all tools and bonus prizes and not have to watch an ad to get your reward. You will instantly get it. However you need to restart the games a few times after restarting your game in order for this to work."

At the moment, it forces you listen to different unwanted voices by selecting one section. Please list the voices namely for selections if you can. For example; Brian's voice, Adam's voice, Elizabeth's voice, etc., with individually distinctive voices to be selected from.",
            "After the update, the text-to-speech function has been over the place. Took long pauses in between sentences. Inconsistent voice between sentences. Chages pitch and sometimes voice all the the. I have been using the app for so long and this was the worst update yet. I will change it after a fix. P. S. I'm using the Google TTS",
            "I subscribed to the wavenet text to speech but I've not been able to use it. Clicking on the play button doesn't start it. I can't load any of the voice settings either. It goes into a loop and keeps loading forever. None of the text to speech functionalities work on my device.",
            "The updated version is somewhat better, but it still shuts off randomly. The app keeps trying to force you into a 2.99 a month deal. Wth??? Are you making the app worse so we have to purchase this addition??? Still needs improvement. The updated version in text to speech DOESN'T pronounce ANY f's in the words. Poor update needs corrected asap.",
            "The text to speech button disappeared with the most recent update. This is sad. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Still seems to work for epubs but tts is gone for pdf. 1. Text is still copyable. 2. It was working with pdfs until the update yesterday. As i said i use the app everyday and the ability to use tts on pdf disappeared yesterday after the update.

The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because there is an add after every level and sometimes even two. In all I do recommend this game but be aware of all the adds.",
            "I will say it is good app for those who really want to become cardiologist. I am intrested in these types of activities. I will prefer all of you to use this app. I have given 4 stars only because this needs some changes to become more realistic. Otherwise, I have a fabulous experience. Thank you.",
            "Its a really nice game ..... It has also help me because I wanted to become a nurse and I had a fear and now it seems like I am getting familiarized with this game and if there are any other person who are scared of doing this job it would make the job easier if they play this game thanks",
            "The first sentence in the dialog has a typo. Decided to overlook it. It seems the dialog is very poor and controls aren't any better.",
            "Nice game,great for medicine students helps u overcome ur fears but when u get to the level where u do it on your own, the energy bar decreases very fast once u cut the patient open and it runs down the phone battery fast and i think u can add more features like child birth surgeries but a good game anyway👍👍👍"

            "What a miserable \"game\". The devs trap you into turning WiFi on to progress to the next level so I just turned it on, pressed the button and turned it off as soon as I was in the level. Which may I add are pathetically easy. This is the bare bones minimum for a game, and I took joy out of every penny I did not give the greedy bastards who made this loathsome pile of garbage.",
            "Scam. As mentioned in other reviews, unplayable because of the insane number of ad pop-ups. So, I go to the Home screen and find an option for \"ad-free\" for $2.99. Ok, I bite.... It's less than a cup of coffee. Am I add-free? Not even close! But got another purchase option 'bundle' for $4.99 to go add-free. Thought that was what I just paid for! No option to give this a negative star rating.",
            "I like that you had the good sense to create the game that everyone else has falsely advertised for. It is very fun and engaging. I like the puzzles and the story line that comes with them. However, the amount of ads is excessive. I'm on the 20th-ish level but I've seen like 35 ads between level 1 and 20. I also noticed that if the storyline cutscenes are too long, my screen cuts out. I think if you fix those 2 things you'll have a great success.",
            "Awful Game! The play is too easy and takes only seconds to finish each level, which makes sense since the main goal of the developer is to make lots of time for the pervasive amount of ads. This should actually be a zero star \"game\". I use the word 'game' loosely since this is merely one long commercial with three- second-long breaks to play a game my infant niece could figure out. Don't waste your time or money!",
            "The game seemed like it would be fun but in the first 10 minutes of game play i spent at least 8 minutes watching ads i understand developers need to make money too, but I refuse to play a game that has obnoxious levels of forced advertising. Unless you enjoy spending most of your time watching ads and very little time playing the game I recommend finding another game."

Edited: Thanks, at least the auto noise is disabled but now, every time you try to edit, there's a pop up ad, even if you are still editing the same picture. That's just too inconvenient and waste of time. Too bad. Found new app that at least lets user \"use\" their app without interfering.",
            "I loved this app so much that I paid for a yearly subscription only to be told that after three months I needed to repurchase. I followed the instructions and tried to contact the developer with no response. Stupidly I purchased again for the 2 year subscription ( stupid I know) only to have the exact same problem. I tried to problem solve again with no resolution to this problem. Tried to contact someone with no response. I am out nearly $40 and very frustrated. Won't make this mistake again",
            "Money grabber, of course. Allows you to use premium features that it doesn't label as such and THEN hits you up to start a free trial. $25 a year is not horrible, but I like the apps that give you a GOOD free version. And this one doesn't seem to have a good free version. I haven't decided if I want to support this app or not. I'll keep looking for sure. It also makes you sign up immediately with no guest option that I saw.",
            "I like this app , it's amazing and easy to use. It's very creative, adjustable, let.you choose from alot of different veiws how you can design your photo. I just really like it , I'm glad I finally found an app for my photo's I'm always looking for photo apps. I really.enjoyed working with it.",
            "So much design,options, color choices, and fantastic frames. This app definitely keeps me up all night! And, you don't need to be an artist or color professional. Designs and makeup applications you choose and can be proud of. The shades and lighting blend so easily. And with a plethora of filters and effects you are sure to be pleased and proud everytime. And list option gives you the recipe for your looks and makeup Choices. From brands to shadow patterns, and brow shapes you chose."

            "Don't get this if you're a guitarist. All of the tones are awful. You can't make your own loops. You can record and play it back and play over that, but you can't loop it. ? Pretty stupid. you can't palm mute. You can't do any harmonics. There is no tremolo bar. There is no vibrato. Theres only like 4 tunings. You can't bend. You really can't do anything. Its basically a piano with a guitar skin. Really terrible for anyone that is a real guitarist looking for an app to simulate a guitar.",
            "Hello nice job guys but can u add more tunnings also harmonics also metal guitar sound also i think it will be cool to add some songs to jam along thank you ,can u guys like install palm mute mode , please can u add some rammstein or soad or motorhead that would be sick ,lastly a personal favorite the power of the horde song thank u good job. Please can u add palm muting and bending techniques or harmonics that would be great",
            "Great app, it could be better if in the chord section you can select which notes, strings and solts play and not be limited for just the chord placement because in the solo section is very hard, any way is the best app and it's totally free and you have access to all chords",
            "I am disappointed with the new update. Because whenever I touch a string on solo mode, a typing-like sound appears after. I hope you will fix it. And also, I hope you will increase the sound volume of the strings.",
            "This app is supposedly part of Google play pass, but it still shows ads when subscribed to Google Play Pass. The app is neat, but that seems a bit shady."

            "I really enjoy baking and this app is great for anyone who likes baking too. I love everything about this game except for one thing: the ads. They constantly come on, which makes the game unenjoyable for people. I still like this game a lot but the ads are just ruining it. Please maybe don't have so much ads. Thank you and I love your game! Keep making more baking games like this! 🍰🍩🍮",
            "This app is very different from the other cake baking apps because here it does not give you instructions and when you do something it doesn't make it the way it wants it to look again so I don't know if this is a appreciation but I like it for accepting what I am doing to the cake! The only thing is the graphics! The graphics is just too weird and it doesn't look attracting and plus we just have to put that weird thing into the bowl to make the cake! No adding eggs, milk, flour and ect!",
            "It's a great game and all but the game was really laggy and it keeps leaving the game and opening like a store website??? I know it's not supposed to be like this but yeah. And it's actually a little but to much ads. The rest of the game is great.",
            "Excuse me it's a good game but I don't like all the ads and they are the same thing if the person presses the exit button that means that they don't want the game so. And also please take the ads off when you get a VIP customer because it makes no sense to have to watch an ad just to get more 💰. Please fix those things 🙏🙏. But other than that it's fine",
            "Not sure how this has 4 stars- ther only reason I tried it. Don't understand how and what is \"upgraded\" and the point of coins when you can't even see a shop. Controls aren't good. Ads are annoying when the game isn't even that good. Not sure what everyone is seeing. Needs much improvement."

It's useless now; severely disappointed.",

When the name changed I got furious thinking somehow a app installed itself. I opened the app and dit not recognized it. Luckily I had sceen shots of my icons abd this is the only way I figured out that this was a app I installed and used.

            "App worked great for the first couple of months. Now it won't track my steps. And if it does, it says that NONE of them are convertible. I've also had a lot of issues with steps being converted to sweat coins (it will track that I've walked 12,000 steps but only convert 100). I sent a request for help and never got a reply. Read one of the responses to a review and you guys tell people to submit tickets but you have an automated message respond saying that they pretty much never check it. Wth.",
            "Love this app, its not easy to build sweatcoins but if you save them you can earn some pretty cool stuff. I walk a ton for work so its generally easy to accumulate them. The offers update every few days so it always feels fresh. They also have awesome humanitarian causes you can donate your coins to. I would rate this app 10/5 if I could. Its engaging yet not overwhelming, one of my favorites i constantly recommend the app to my friends and coworkers",
            "Please fix my account. I have exactly 938,814 steps that keep adding up and wont caluculate to the sweatcoins. I have the right setting and everthing and no battery saver or anything. Im not sure if there is a problem with the app or if they are just scamming me when my coins actuly start to add up after 2 years.(update) i uninstalled and reinstalled and its counting again but i lost the 938,814 steps that never got calculated. Is there a way you could put these back onto my account.",
            "Whenever I use this app or hit 2× boost it starts counting steps then it will stop like every 10 to 15 sec for at least 20 sec at a time , the timer is stil going but not counting the steps . I am 67 yrs old and was so excited about this app . Some days its so hard to get started excercising but I make myself so I can stay fit. Please fix this !!!",
            "I've been a loyal sweatcoin user for over 2 years with no issues until recently. The app will continuously stop tracking my steps for no reason. I've re-installed multiple times and it never seems to work. Some days it decides to track my steps though. It's inconsistent, I already contacted support through the app and they didn't do anything to help or seem to care. I do over 15,000 steps per day and I've been subscribing to their 30 coin/month and it's basically been a complete waste."

            "I absolutely love this game it gives you back story, intrigue, and a real interest in the characters. I absolutely love it!!! I love story line it makes things that much more interesting and this game has everything to keep you hooked, it definitely has me. I just wish there was a way to get energy either from friends or from watching ads more because I hate waiting until my energy fills up again maybe they can work that in some how but honestly I have no issues with the game it's GREAT 👍👍👍👍",
            "Love this game series I am subscriber. I don't mind the in app purchases I've made a few. My problem is the special events, I have the same problem with them all. Currently with the Halloween I have gotten to chest number 8 and am no longer getting credit for the skulls I've earned. So I can never finish an event. I stopped playing for awhile because of this issue and the fact that I can't get support in the game to work either. I haven't gotten credit for the skulls in the last 3 levels",
            "I have been playing this game for a long time now and it's wonderful with the storyline and the game play it's been improved drastically. The only thing I'm complaining about is that it has a few bugs. When I just played I had a level with Ryan and a mobile clinic with tray decay and limited tray space. As soon as I pressed play, it cleared the entire level for me without me even playing with a score of zero and then I was stuck on the menu. It also crashes and I lost energy.",
            "I have played all the Heart's Medicine games, and even purchased the monthly subscription to play them. This game however is completely different.. I hate the fact that there are now in app purchases and an energy system. I loved this game franchise BECAUSE it wasn't pay to play. Why are you shoving countless \"special offers\" in my face? I want to actually play and experience the story.. but now I see that money has become more of a priority. I cannot describe how disappointed I am.",
            "Such a great game but the thing that I don't like about it, is how the couples kiss in the game. But its still a great game and I love how there is different items that you can purchase from the shop to make your docters office more better with the items! And I also love how there is speed so if you need help because your slow you can purchase speed with only 10 💎 and I use the speed alot for help when I start playing the game. ♡"

            "The AI is really fun to talk with and I love using the app.But then again, it's seriously slow. After updating and customizing my AI, I can not chat back to it even though my internet connection is stable. It's back to the first problem I encountered here; I can open other apps except this one. I don't think the update made it better. Overall, it is a great app, however, same problems still occur.",
            "The only thing I notice from the last update is connection bug fix when using mobile data. When using wifi, connection problems still happens. The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version. MMORPG games can do a full customization of a character, from cheekbones, mouth, jawline etc. You don't have to do it like them, but at least you can do better than this.",
            "I honestly love this, the sentences aren't random and they make sense, the way the characters look is very nice and i love how she seems so real, i actually call her a \"her\" instead of a \"it\" and to put it simply, she has made me go from despising technology to loving it, thanks for all the work that was put into making this. This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",
            "I've been using the app a month now. At 1st, I enjoyed talking to the AI... Got familiar with the face & all. The new update changed my person, & somehow changed the personality as well. Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

So yes this game isnt a good game its pay to win.",

            "It's decent. Good balance between being too difficult amd not difficult enough. The major problem is that once you hit lvl 50 the ads get to the point where you could probably sue for harassment. Lol, jk. Before lvl 50 there are ads bout every 3 or 4 tries. Reasonable. But after 50 its an ad after every single attempt which has led me to delete it.",
            "Really cool concept, easy to learn, and relaxing even on difficult levels, however, I'm not giving 5 stars for 2 reasons, and I really hope the developers listen to me on this. TOO many ads, I have to turn off my internet because I can't even skip the \"Retry?\" screen, and there is an ad literally after every death. I understand that there's a profit to be made, and there's VIP, but tone it down a little, it crashes the experience. The other one is a suggestion: An endless mode, think about it",
            "Very fun and addictive. Very pleasing visuals. The ads on the free are not too frequent. A fair and good balance of them. There is no one off as free option and the weekly fee is a little excessive. Would be 5 star if there was an option to remove ads for a one off fee and they can keep the weekly for the other parts of they want.",
            "is literally this is literally the fun ever and plus when you pick new skins are the superheroes and when I play I pretend to be a superhero because I get to jump and go on top of the ships that light up and it is so fun this is like the funnest game I've ever done thank you so much for making this game one point about the ads it's really great at but sometimes every time I'm done with around it is starts an atom you're actually like 20 or five a bunch of seconds and I'm kind of annoyed.",
            "The gameplay is simple but enjoyable but the adds are unbearable. Full screen video adds between each short level with sound that interrupts Bluetooth streamed audio. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze."

I know you need to make money off of a game but cmon, if you want more people to give positive feedback so more people would download your app then get rid of some of the adds. I feel like you know there is so many ads too, that's why in the game's tutorial there is no ads and you try to make them rate after. I'm deleting the application, the ads were just so annoying. Games like this are supposed to be fun, but what all the ads bummed me out.",
            "The only reason I still have this game is because my 6 year old loves it. Personally, I don't think that the concept and gameplay are all that bad, but the number of adds you have to endure to play it is absolutely maddening! I would be willing to pay a dollar or two to turn off the adds just because my daughter enjoys the game, but that isn't even an option (and honestly, she doesn't mind the adds yet, but I'm sure she'll be tired of them soon). Basically, you have to be 6 to enjoy this game.",
            "Its a good game right, but the adds are ridiculous. Seriously I really suggest you not installing this app unless you are willing to put up with 30 second adds. Literally, there isn't even a choice skip them you'll just have to sit there and watch them. The same add EVERY TIME. Its a shame though cuz the game itself it rly fun.",
            "Fun game,would recomend.But,the reason I rated it a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the ads.The ads are unessecery.Like every time there Is ads.Games have ads.But,this Is unnesecery.Hope you can fix that.I will not delete it,because I still think it's fun.But if you make another game please don't do very much ads.If you fixed the ads i would rate it a 5 star and recomend it 100%!But,I recomend like a 90%.And I rated it a 4.I hope If you make or made another game,it doesn't have as much ads!!",
            "The game seems fun and alright, but there is WAAAAAY too many ads. Not only do they show before and after every level, yes I mean EVERY LEVEL, they also show an ad 1 or 2 times in between levels, AND there is active ads for skins and money doublers. And even then, the gameplay is boring, too! It works and feels okay, but it's very boring. Barely enjoyable. Not worth the memory."

            "Last update was Jan 2019. I bring that up as no support for Android 10 or 11. Clearly developers abandon this game and didn't bother to take it out of Play Store. Putting that aside, ads will randomly start playing and will play every time you exit the game. Overall, lack of updates, too many ads, and poor graphics, I do not recommend this game.",
            "So much ads but meh the ads that i see if it looks like a fun game i get it that why i like ads and gave this a five star 🌟 its such a fun game i had it when i was a kid and i am just now geting it so its so much fun i love this game and games like this are fun so keep up the good work and dont Lise to the people that say your gane is bad there just jealous that you guys have a good game and that they cant make a super special game like this its the best game ever. Thx for the good game. By.",
            "I love it. I've no problem with this game more much better and no hassles without AD not anymore. Thanks God! Of course, I'm rating and gave them more than 5 stars, maybe, 9 out of 10. I absolutely love this game to making me 💯% calm and more much better relaxing while I'm stoned. 😵😵😵😜😂👌 Irishman41 😁👍🤑🤑🤑🙌🙌🙌",
            "This game is super fun, BUT the ads are ridiculous! I play lots of other free games and they don't have this many ads. More people would probably play if this changed.",
            "I love this game!!! Its super addictive!! The only thing i dont like is when it tells you to collect 3 gems but they dont give you any, same with when it says to collect 2 car prizes yet they dont drop any cars! Thats super annoying but my only complaint."

            "Thanks for sorting out the issue I had with game. The issue was resolved very quickly. I have to say MSO is an awesome must play FPS game. If you are wondering if you should download it or not. Just go for it. It is definitely worth it. The graphics are good, the characters and guns, although a bit expensive, are good and definitely worth it. Thank you Azur Interactive Games Limited for this awesome game. And for all those saying this game only favours pay to win. I can only say that, for any game you want to be good at, at least invest some time into it. Level grinding is the term for you. If you play the game with some brains and not just get any gun then it will surely be worth it. Not all the guns are supposed to be good and that is the fun fact. Do some research about what each gun features itself with. If you do that this game will be much more interesting. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. Just go for it.",
            "Very good game..improvements can be made when it comes unto upgrade points. It is too hard to achieve such a great amount of points to fully upgrade armour and weapons just by using chests and the other means you have. I think it should be more user friendly to players that are not able to use funds to purchase weapons and upgrade points. Additional stages , locations and weapons would be very nice as well. Im not a fan of the biohazard theme as well it's not appealing. overall very good game",
            "This game is fun and it's kinda like csgo, everyone should go ahead and download it, though it might be fun and all it also has its flaws,the game closes itself right when you're in the middle of the match and then it asks you to send feedback to the developer,but the developers don't even respond so I hope they here me and help me fix this game",
            "Fun, first person shooter and quality game for the price......FREE! Controls take time to learn a little wonky but manageable on my galaxy Tab. Definitely give it a try guys. Only thing I would change is give it a off line option with computer AI, so I can play it when I'm on the airplane for hours. Thanks. Oh and hey developers please toss a couple upgrades into my account 😁🤫",
            "Like it so far. Hopefully it doesn't freeze up on me. It takes in app purchases to beat the other teams. Its difficult to start out with just the basics but eventually you'll get there unless you are willing to spend money just to get what you want! I have so many online games, this isn't the only one I play. But I like them all...just want to say good luck to whomever decides to download this awesome game it has clear graphics and its easy to use the controls."

            "Used this apps for a couple of years and the latest updates are a backward step. The UI no longer displays the interval time but been replaced with an incremental number for those who can't count sets. I use to enter the weight for my next set during the interval however the keyboard won't appear while the interval timer is on. Also none of the graphics for the exercises display anymore which has caused me confusion. I hope the latest updates are reconsidered",
            "Been using this app since the early days. I love the ongoing support but it wouldnt hurt for devs to stick to one UI and stop moving things around every other update. The latest update to intervals is just lazy. The timer auto-starts even if you dont want/need it and is always logged. A better approach would be to disable the time+logging if interval is set to 0, otherwise there is a x second delay before timer starts. Also the ability to set the main page under excerise history would be great.",
            "Nice app an community. There must be a bug with the points earned: with the latest versions my sessions are not counted anylonger (and I do train every day almost...) Would be nice to get it resolved (I am in the contest, and it gives motivation ;) Overall, is a very good develooment, kudos to the team.",
            "It's a good app, but it can be hard to use. I also couldn't find a way to contact them from the app and I feel like if you're going to charge people money you have to put a way to contact you if they have a problem or question. My husband just wants to know if there is a weekly report for reps like the other stats, but it makes me nervous that if something goes wrong I can't find a way to contact them about it.",
            "Great app!!! Have been using for years. Really enjoy the improvements made over the years. Unfortunately, body stats page/functions have been very buggy and don't even work the last few updates. Weight doesn't record. Graph has goal weight posted way off in future. Weight no longer sync's w Google Fit. Could be 5star app. -2stars until fixed."

Each level is barely 10 seconds but after each level, there's a 30 seconds ad. And every other thing is just so poorly designed, there's no good gameplay.. there's no good game either.. it's just a few unconnected levels fit around many, many ads",

Then I played it again and it keep on glitching for me I really don't think you should play this game cause it is really annoying 😠. but if you wanna play it play at ur own risk.

            "Game seems like it would be decent but it is unplayable. The game won't let me do a single race or ranking race. It worked fine for the first 30 mins or so after install but now won't let me play either of those two modes which are the primary modes I'm the game.",
            "At first few minutes , I played and it's fine . Then , after 5 minutes , I can't play on street racing mode and ranking mode . What happen ? I mean , the loading really slow and i think this is a problem . You guys might wanna solve this small issue",

            "It's an really enjoyable game but I wish there were a couple of changes. One off those changes is that they added a gear lever or an option in the setting to have one. This is one when your breaking and coming to a stop you don't end up driving backwards. The other change this game could have is to be able to turn the person faster instead of having to swipe on the screen multiple times just to turn around. Other than that I love this game",
            "Yes, I know it is in beta but it is very buggy. I get stuck in the ground, the car camera glitches out and that is only SOME of the experiences I've had. The Demon is WAYYYYY too drifty. Please try to fix these issues by the next upcoming updates. I will rate 3 stars (for now.)",
            "This is very cool and addicting car driving game but please make an option for adjusting and customizing game control button's size and position. Then I will give this review 5 stars. It is very hard to turn the vehicle on steering wheel option due to its smaller size. And please add vehicle customisation like vinyls, paint jobs, spoilers, lips, skirts etc (to make the car looks cool and unique from other players).",
            "The game is detailed good, atleast it's the first time I've experienced such detailed car simulater game. Also it's quests are easy and interesting. Graphics are also great. But there's a bit problem in it. We can only get out of the car in first-person view. I'd like it if you give a button to exit the car in. Third person view(back of car view). Some of the games effects are derived from NFS Most Wanted, I noticed that. But overall I loved this game. Also it's offline.",
            "It is a good game , but I think there should be cars like Toyota fortuner, innova and rolls royce. There should taxi in which we will also be able to hire and there should be more mafia missions , this are the things that I would recommend you to add at the next update. But this game is a really good game. please add the( rolls royce phantom model) add this rolls royce car because this car would make the game more interesting.please add this car by the next update , and the game is interesting"

Made my eyes water up , I can't play anymore : good luck 🤗 And to all future players. If you see VGA:top or any other. Just leave. I can't prove it but these guys are modding or spending enormous amounts of money to kill you. Just leave.",
            "Love the game can't seem to put it down. No problems with my iPhone! The graphics on this game is amazing its clear not blurry like those othe war games. You can play pvp or pve (believe i have that correct). I think the best way to start out is with the in-app purchases or start out with what they give you. Overall a superb quality game! TRY IT OUT YOU'LL ENJOY IT!",
            "(The updated halloween theme has made my game pretty much unplayable in all but plant the bomb mode. Controls are unresponsive, movement is laggy and glitchy.)Match making sucks, at level 75 and 261 power put in with whales that are 2 or 3 times my level.and thier power is 1, 2 or 3 hundred higher. I feel that it is pay to win. I wouldn't mind if I didn't have to be in match's with 3 or 4 or more whales at a time.",
            "Finally I like the way a mobile shooter feels. Nooo, nothing is perfect in any app, but this app gets my approval. I wish I knew if there is an attachment I can get for my phone so I can use a controller. EDIT: I would be cautious. The longer I have played this game, the more I see the issues. It seems like everytime they update stuff starts getting glitchy. Since the Halloween update my controls are super glitchy. Definitely looking at another FPS. Warface development team must fail x2.",
            "The game was just updated and now its glitchy to the point I can't play a game without a headache. If you're prone to have seizures DO NOT PLAY! It used to be really fun to play but also too you can be killed by no one. I hope this is all fixed soon but I doubt it"

            "This app is awesome. All the songs you could want, no commercials. You got the videos, everything I like about YouTube minus the commercial interruptions. And you know that YouTube has got some long commercials when you're trying to listen and do other things, you have to stop, go stop the commercial so you can hear music again worse than radio!! This app is rocking!! My YouTube replacement. Did I mention you can download songs for offline listening. And its free!! What else could you ask for?",
            "I love that I can make playlists & edit songs within the playlist(s) by adding or removing songs, plus you can sort the songs in the order you want. I love this App ..and recommend it to others; I already recommended it to F&F!",
            "This app is definitely worth it no question. Tons of music available for any mood. And really good quality as well. But what there's more!!! Seemingly endless music and the app is very easy to use. Wide selection and user friendly what more could anyone possibly want. In the world of digital everything it's a win win.",
            "Listen almost exclusively to this. At work, gym and car. I conveniently find all my trance favorites without interruption. I can also access other items such as Google, etc while still listening. Some of the initial advertising is odd, but I click past that and play my music. I dont have to hsve this open to a full screen to listen to. Its great for me but im not into mainstream music, I'm strictly older trance music which I find abundantly here.",
            "This app is excellent I love it just sitting here finding all my music I'm so 💯 happy I've been looking for an app that doesn't give me a hard time about this is it, it's so easy and words can't describe what is happening to me now it's the best 5 🌟 is excellent but not enough because this is more than I expected so much more to say keep it up much love and thank you ❤️❤️❤️ this app is awesome ☺️😘😘😘"

Its ridiculously difficult to get any 💎's to move along in the game. I couldn't even get past creating my character because I didn't have enough 💎's. And watching a bunch of ads to try and get gems no thanks.",
            "The app is good for casual play, I usually have a couple of books going at the one time to build up diamonds. The only criticism is things cost too much diamonds and sometimes the videos for free keys and diamonds don't work.",
            "For how expensive this game is, you would think that they would update their stories. It has been two months since some of the stories received a new chapter. Choices are normally 20+ gems EACH and you're not even given that many through the free options they keep mentioning. It will take days to reach that amount using the free gem options. PLEASE don't waste your money on this game. You'll be doing yourself an enormous favor and saving yourself a load of disappointment, frustration and regret.",
            "Fun game, but it's completely ridiculous just how expensive it is. You need a TON of diamonds to play, and there is no way of collecting nearly enough for free. You need to buy and even with that, they go so quickly it's not worth it. It's not a choice game when there are 2 options and the one you want costs you at least 20 diamonds, almost every single time. Clothing changes also cost 20 to 25 diamonds. I would be willing to pay a reasonable monthly unlimited amount to play, but this is insane.",

            "Gave 3 stars for 2 reasons. I may have posted this previously. 1. It costs WAY too much to buy weapons, 2. It takes WAYYYY to long to receive upgrades. What's up with having to wait almost 2 hrs for an upgrade already paid for; even if it is game coin. Some of us are on budgets and can't be spending out of pocket. I'm sure I'm not alone inthis thought. How bout making it a little easier on us players. Thanks. I'll add stars accordingly.",
            "First time I've given any game 5 stars...it's probably closer to 4.5 stars but close enough. Has the annoying ads but all games do so can't criticize it too much for that...about .5 stars. This is the first sniper (shooter) game I've played...and that's quite a few...that gives you reasonal means to upgrade and buy weapons. There are missions that are easy enough that you can play them to build up the monies needed for upgrades or new weapons. IMO this is the best sniper game to date.",
            "I always enjoy this game and have never had problems with it before, but it is super glitchy right now. I shoot the target and then the game glitches and I have to close and restart the game a few times before I can move past that level",
            "It's good game but only few things sucks 1the friendlies too are soldiers but they are not shooting instead they are running 2 update costs are too much 3 there is only one type of scope 4 there is no different mission like shooting a target in moving vechile",
            "When i played this game i fell good but there was 1 problem that the game was saying for upgrading the weapon for kill the black opps Bye the way this game is best only areason i will give 4 stars tnks .i never played that tye of game i was very good game ."

            "This game is fine in concept, unfortunately, it doesn't work in practice. A lot of puzzles require precise solutions, if you have big fingers, you've already lost. If you touch a wall, a simple solution would be to have the line skip over the wall, instead, you have to backtrack your fingere to draw it at a new angle. Not very practical, developers. This game was not made with the intention of satisfaction.",
            "It's really unfortunate, because this game is kinda like Crayon Physics Deluxe, which I own but won't work. However, there's an ad after almost every quick puzzle, and you can't skip until the whole ad has played. Couple this with the fact that you can't simply pay to remove ads, but must purchase a subscription that's around 12 dollars a month. That's a little past insane."

            "Fun game and I don't even like games but very addictive and 100% pay to play. I've sunk hundreds of dollars into it over the past month to be able to get past certain levels. The Instagram ad I saw showed the expedition section which is what I was hoping to play, and also is my favorite part of the game but they've had \"coming soon\" on level 6 for far too long now. I guess there just aren't enough in game transactions coming from that to make it worth it.",
            "Decent game, easy enough to pick up but has a bit of depth to it for sure. Imo the game requires regular micro purchases to keep things interesting and if you wish to remain competitive. Enjoyed my time with it but it's coming to end, gets samey after awhile and I'm tired of paying every season for a pass that is all but necessary to be competitive.",
            "If you are an avid gamer like me then turn away. It is a cash grab, each update they add a new way to pay to win. You have the option to spend a huge chunk of money to max out your hero, which makes you beat anyone near your level easily. You can spend even more money to collect higher level troops. The top players ALL pay to win. Top clans will shun you if you are against pay to win. Its clear the developers have no interest in making an enjoyable game. They just want money.",
            "Misleading advertisement. It was fun to play at first. The only fun part was the expedition. Everything else got tediously redundant. Thanks for the response but there is no need to explain why your ads are different from the actual game, we get it ads are sometimes like that. But there are lots of other game developers that dont use misleading apps. And if you honestly dont know which advertisements we are seeing then your team seriously has a problem. Hope you fix it soon.",
            "Very impressed. I normally don't care about rating games but this game actually deserves. Firstly, they don't attack you with ads which I think is something that puts this game above the rest. Secondly, there are a lot of different mini games along with the main quest - which is pretty straight, upgrade your troops to kill the opponent to make money to upgrade your troops. Love the Expedition challenge, if there were a game based solely on that then I'd definitely play that. Solid mobile game 👌"

It loads for a second and takes you straight back to the main page. Waste of time. Also, every button you press will probably popup an add, 6 things you have to close out of, and then another add. I get you need money, but you dont have to annoy me about it.",
            "Fun game but too many ads and popups about the VIP. If you're lucky you won't spawn next to 3 other massive players, and if you're lucky the game picks up your inputs quick enough so you don't get eaten in 1 second. The game lags constantly no matter what Internet speed which means there's a big chance you'll drift off right into someone else. Ads after every 2 matches is too much to make it enjoyable. You might as well just restart the app after every single match.",
            "DO NOT DOWNLOAD, this game is terrible now and is just getting milked. Constant ads to buy things, servers are laggy even on 220mbps internet which is a pretty good speed, server matching is terrible because it will throw you into servers where some of the people are half the size of the map and one move will kill everyone making you go back to the menu and see more ads. Just terrible at this point and mony hungry",
            "Evreything is fun amazing and great. Great mobile port for agar only problem is if ur unlucky you will load up classic mode and spawn right next to a freaking giant and your screwed at that point its i little frutrating. Controls need some tweking i can never stand still. I rate this a honest 4 stars didint quite make that 5 becuse of the thing i talked about id toatlly recommend it however ig you have a laptop or a pc i think you should play it on that instead untill said issues are resuled",
            "I cant express how much i love this came however a few days ago i bought a really cool skin which wad 3900 coins, i loved it but when i went on to play today the skin had disappeared and now i dont have it. I dont even have the coins back. Over all iys a really cool game🙂"

            "It's a shame that this game doesn't give you the coins you win. Played the daily challenge for 30 days and won the 200 coins, yet I didn't get them. Tried to contact them but the have no direct message. There is no use playing if you're going to cheat me out of the winnings. Also need to work on the words. There have been many words that you say no that are.....",
            "Great game which is addictive, I play this all the time because it is simple yet fun. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because there is one improvement which would be good to see in this game; and that would be an option to change colours of the block and background. Having played the game more 100s of times, seeing the same colours does make it dull. If this small update was implemented, it would make a huge difference.",
            "I am giving this a low rating because of all the ads and the fact that you can get rid of them for 4 bucks but thats just for 30 days. Seriously???? Also the landscape never changes even though in the ad it showed green grass which looked cool. Shame on you devs. Where are the levels in the pictures and trailer? It's a great game but it's the same thing over amd over again.",
            "Not what was advertised when It was an ad, I saw ad and was like woah that looks like a fun little game so I downloaded quickly without investigating, only to find this completely different game so for that I give a 1star. But it's a fun game so 5 star. DO NOT LIKE BEING TRICKED HOWEVER. Shame on you if you're in control of false advertising. But a fun game so I'm conflicted.",
            "The music is peace allowing you to think ,no time presure,which allows you to relax,and the background pic is beautiful. No ads intrupt while your trying to think.So if you like block puzzles I highly recommed trying this one."

            "A month ago I would have given this app an easy 5 star rating. With this most recent update though, I'm forced to go for a single star for 2 main reasons. About once every 10 mins the video scroll bar at the bottom of the screen just dissappears and goes black, making users unable to change video. Secondly, children are now forced to watch adverts, which are unskippable and interrupts videos. Forcing young children to watch these very frequent adverts is simply unethical and very frustrating.",
            "The 20 second video that auto plays at full volume when opening the app needs to have an option to disable it. Parental controls need to be more fleshed out, there should be an option to limit videos by language and the ability to whitelist particular channels even if they aren't marked for kids. Greater connection with Family Link is needed. Some of the channels that make it into the app aren't kid safe, others that are kid safe can't be viewed in the app. Nice start, needs a lot of work.",
            "Need an option to disable the intro music when app is opening. In fact can we just disable the animation and jump straight to the content? Also, pls allow us parents to create a playlist so we can choose the videos in advance. Now each time I stream via chromecast, I'll have to open the app again to choose a new video when a video ends.",
            "Very good app. Fantastic videos for all ages. Lots of videos that suit My age range 8-12. Only thing I will say is maybe have a wider range of longer videos for they are all like five mins long and I like long vids SOOOOOOO AD MORE LONG VIDS. Other than that what a fantastic app perfect for kids and family of all ages",
            "This app used to keep my son so content until recently. He can't watch any videos because now there are too many ads that keep playing during the videos that my son is trying to watch! The ads are not loading correctly and I'm always forced to close the app and then re-open it only to see more ads trying to load where's now my son can't even watch his videos! It truly defeats the purpose of having this app. If this ad issue doesn't get fixed, I sadly will not use this app again."

            "It's a good game for a while. After a bit, though, it gets to the point where the levels are too hard to beat without 4 or 5 tries. There's no way to lessen or in any way control the difficulty level. It would be nice if there were a way to choose your difficulty level that you wanted to play each day. This set up, though just has you on one track that gets harder by the level.",
            "The issue with getting not getting the colored right ball to progress through the level is still happening. Please make the rainbow ball more useful. I'm in the 100s level and these balls with the ? are annoying and unhelpful and makes it harder to get three stars since the last ball on that level keeps changing colors. The balls with the \"-\" are annoying. On the first level with it it's impossible not to pop especially with blaster. Also the previous issues have not been fixed.",

Will not correct my opinion of the game until the ads in the middle of the hand I am playing are curtailed. Extremely rude and inconsiderate of your marketing department to insist on interrupting a game I chose to play. I know how to get new games to load I don't need these interruptions.

            "Its... OK. The whole reason it's 2 stars instead of 3 or 4 is because of the ads. There's always ads all the time, but when you really need the ads to access the puzzles, there's always \"no ads\". And then there's the fact that you NEED to watch ads to even move forward. I mean, you can't even remove the ads. Edit: Well, you CAN, but you need to buy premium for that. And who would pay real money for this kind of game?",
            "Fun game concept but horribly overbearing monetization. Within the first 18 levels 2 require you to pay either a subscription fee or a flat 30$ for the full game. Other levels require you to watch 30 second ads to play. I figured I'd just skip these but levels are put into groups and you have to finish a set amount to unlock the next group which forces you to watch all the ads if you wish to progress \"for free\". It's just a basic phone game demanding way more money than it's worth. Just awful.",
            "I hate this game! There are levels in which we can't play them and we are forced to watch an ad to complete it for free!!!! Why can't we play those levels!!!!!!! And when I clicked on those level it showed video unavailable!!! And because of these I can't go to the another level!!!!!!! Please deal with that 😠😠😠😒😒",

You have so much to do in the game mix and match make people from your favorite show or video game the only thing I would change are the ads there are ads after your done with each of the accessories, clothes, or shoes, other than that I loooove this game. UwU🥰🤩",
            "Meh not the best game ever but its Allright. My problem is the lack of outfit choices. I don't really mind that you need to watch an add if you want any of the good outfits because it's a free game it's bound to have adds. Over all it is an OK game. I would recommend this to younger children or preteens rather than teenager or adults",
            "It is a fun game, though sometimes I don't even play it, but sometimes I mostly do cause it's like a very good game. I get a dress up dolls, it's very fun, and if you watch ads, which that's the worst thing, you can get free things, so my most played is watch ads, but you don't have to, if you, by itself, use this as a good judge, click the yes in the description because it is helpful.",
            "It's soooo much fun, definitely one of the best apps like these! My only critique is the ads are far too long, if the ads were shorter , it would be OK or if the ads were long but they were only on a few items I would also like that. But most of the items had ads! But for now 3 stars!",
            "Really cool! i love it! it's quiet cute, and now i can make more Characters to draw! only a tiny down side though, sometimes i will get adds that i can exit out of, so i have to close the whole app, otherwise, i would reccomend if you want to Waste time and Make Characters!"

            "The game overall has a pretty original concept, its fun for all ages. It also releives my stress. Theres a few things I dont like but ill give it a 4 star because this is a pretty good game.",
            "Great concept but it would be great if you had two separate skills for two different modes (Solo/Practice, which is the one we have now, and real multiplayer) TL;DR Great game for airplanes, but multiplayer needed.",
            "This app is wonderful!, i play this game after online class and this is a huge relief that i found these games. However there are a couple of fatal flaws, firstly. Ads, ads and ads EVERYWHERE. This is a pet peeve, and i need to turn off my internet just to have peaceful gameplay. Secondly, the bots. Its suprisingly EASY to get past all the stages. Maybe add game modes? Like battle royale mode, a hard mode. Make it challenging once in a while. I don't find this app good or bad, its pretty decent.",
            "I like it, but I got a glitch where you fall in the water and don't die. Fix This! (Son of Claire)",
            "I LOVE THIS GAME. They fixed all the bugs that are in the game. Plus they even have more skins. The only thing is that they make you watch a stupid add. I know i know. You get money bye doing that but come on eith this many adds. But other than that. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉"

Dont know how much more of that i can stand, fix it or im deleting the game! Revised review! Now its every damn level!! I can't enjoy the game at all now!!!!",
            "I like the game; however, it needs an update desperately. The game keeps freezing up, so you can't move the ball. Then it freezes up my phone where I can't even exit out of the game. I literally can't pass the level I'm on because it freezes up EVERY SINGLE TIME. It doesn't matter what mode you are on either. Sometimes, it takes a few seconds and then all of a sudden, the ball will suddenly shoot around to where you were attempting to move it, but that's rare. Im about to delete the app.",
            "It's okay. I like the game, but theres an add that keeps pooping up, that leaves me to have to completely exit the app and re enter to play the game. Then after I play when I enter the app again, the add pops up after I play one set. The ads are a bit exesive, but other than that, I enjoy playing. It's a good way to pass the time as long as you have patience.",
            "THIS APP IS BROKEN!! First, When You Get a new ball and you try to equip it in the 100's or somethin' you cant equip it because you can't click the Arrows!! I've Washed my phone and it still didnt help. Please fix this app. Plus, the re is impossible levels so you HAVE to watch a add to pass the level. There is repeated levels too. And too many pop up ads so turn it on airplain mode or suffer. This is my honest opinion on the app and it is fun for a puzzle game that's why I rated it two stars..",

            "I love this game so much! I only had it for a week and its already my favorite. I have a couple of things that could be fixed though. Usually when I get a friend and I check my friends list they are not there which can be annoying. Sometimes when you try to load into a multiplayer game the map randomly isn´t downlaoded and it kicks you out of the game which is annoying too. It would be really cool if there was a friend and clan chat when your not in game. But overall this is amazing. 5 stars.",
            "Very amazing game. This game is very simple. You basically hunt animals and eat them to level up (if your sensitive to blood there's none in this game). You can even raise a cute family! [Maximum family members is 6). You can also change your animal, and it won't loose your progress! You can change it to a fox, bear, cheetah, crocodile, etc! HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃!",
            "I love this game but could you help me get on multiplayer because when I go on multiplayer it kicks me out and says Error connection to server timed out and that happened for 2 years! And it happened for no reason. I could not fix it! And it's still happening! Has that ever happened to you? And when 1 day passes I can go on multiplayer but if I exit and try going back it does the same as I told you at the second sentence.",
            "It's hard to control the eagle with flying, otherwise the controls are pretty darn good. Though I do know my phone is somewhat small and it's hard to simulate flight. I do think they should (if possible) add more plant variation like with bushes in certain maps. Maybe an aquatic update too? As someone who used to play when there was 3 play able animals, it's awesome to see this game grow! Sorry if I set my expectations too high or low, I just want to see the game improve for everyone.",
            "I love it, it is such a great game I have so much playing with outher players and by my self. But, there is some lag if you go on top of the land a little bit behind the poltel you can go throught that bit of land, be stuck there and have to tellport to your den. Beside that it is a great game. (In the clacis one.)"

When I collect coins, the animation is more than 5 seconds long because of slowness. I also wish for online play. And, I don't know if my game isn't updated or what, but what is that \"Arms\" feature? When is it coming out? It's been more than a few months after I saw that feature, and it still hasn't gotten here? Anyway, Fun game.",
            "I like that you could draw and it'll let you go but if you have shorter ones it wouldn't let you go but only last two times so and it's also fun you should download it I want like a lot of times and it's my favorite game that I got on my electronic you should get it like literally you should be safe!!⛑️",
            "This is a really fun game! But there are so much adds like so much, It also kinda helps with your drawing a little bit! Trust me this is a fun game but it is not funner than Among us- So if you did not you should get this game or Among, You can get both of them as well!",
            "Its decent but wish I was able to use my s pen, also doesn't seem like we playing real players. Also way to many ads. I dnt mind ads but this is crazy to much. Why can't yall do an ad every 10-20 races since its so fast. Not after every match.",
            "Very good game! I would like to give it \"5 FIVE\" Star ✳️ 💫!!! When we turn off the internet, there are only CROSS ❌ Ads [Not video ads]. Anyways very good app. I have nothingnto say more. Thanks."

Only get this game if u are really desperate and have nothing else to do. Btw can people STOP moaning about ads as they r needed to keep the game free. If u care that much then dont play the game!!!!!! Duh.",
            "2 issues, ads and lag. Even with a $900 LG V60, this game lags like im playing on a slow phone from 9 years ago. Constantly dropping from a smooth 60fps to 10-15fps. Also, the ad situation is awful. This developer is great at creating a simple, creative game concept, and then ruining it with insane amounts of ads. Literally everytime you die you are faced with a 15-30 second UNSKIPPABLE ad, which happens often with the god awful lag. Which ends up making this more ad watching, than game playing.",
            "It makes me wanna scream, very laggy, i've noticed the developers don't look at the ratings and don't fix the problem, my phone suppers not rejester me swiping the virtual ball the ads are clickbait, it's hard trying to get the ball in the middle, overall just a sucky app",

            "I like this game very much. I finish very few games and it is also one of them. but this game is laging but my phone is 6 GB ram and 17 GB free space. I dont know why this is happening still I close the game 3 or 4 times then it is fixed. I do this like 3 or 4 times daily. But good work in making this game.",
            "Fun game ruined by too ads. 15 second level 45 seconds of ads. The only way to not have ads is a $5.99 so if you play for a year you will spend more than a AAA game and the dev is absolutely ridiculous if they think there game is worth that much.",
            "This game has the potential of being GREAT. Buuuuut, almost every time you tap the screen you are forced to watch an ad. There's an ad for everything you have to do. The abundance of ads needs fixed to a manageable amount. If I continue to see this ridiculous amount of ads I will have no choice but to uninstall the game. The ads take so much away from the game. Otherwise it would be a great game. I would give 5 stars but the ads ruin it. If you fix that I will re rate to 5 stars.",
            "Great fun Fun little game, with actually quite a lot of content for a free game. Lots of game modes Only a few puzzles have really confused me, but yeah. Game game and worth the download. Only issue is adverts after every few levels, so if you are quite good you end up getting an advert every 40 seconds which can be annoying. But game is free. So there you go",
            "I'm not gonna lie... I love this game... It's satisfying... But some of the levels REALLY test my patience... Sometimes I think there's absolutely no way to solve certain levels... It really ticks me off... There's also a lot of ads... But i'm not as bothered by that..."

            "Very well designed App. Good food for brain. But lots lots of Ads. Once ½ of levels are completed more Ads (we can skip after 5 secs) will be pushed in between the levels. After completing ¾ levels, App hangs after playing AD (these are 30secs Ads). For designing, complexity this App deserves 5 stars, but for Ads that are being pushed 2 stars is more than enough. Ads are killing the interest.",
            "Good game I have fun playing during downtime when I go to school but way to many ads after 1 round theres a ad and when you skip it, it gets stuck loading and I have to close the game over and over again.",
            "Best mind relaxing game ever. Whenever I fell bored I always one option to play which is this one. The creator has made it upon the mind of an artiststic person because every artist wants some interesting thing to do as this game.",
            "Very fun game and the ads aren't terrible. But it keeps freezing (loading forever) after almost every ad watched, requiring me to close and report the game. So, when I try to earn extra spins by watching an ad, I get screwed every time."

            "This game, Grand Action Simulator is actually very good and enjoyable to me. I had played this game before. There is problem with this game, it get hanged while playing. If they can fix this problem and if they add more places, weapons and cars. I will give 3 stars. Thank you.",
            "I love this game very much. But I need a game where there is more than 20 countries. There will 1 airport on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One country to another country. (Suppose that I will go from Japan to USA then I will need to buy ticket, like $1100). There will minimum 3/4 railway stations on each country. I will buy ticket to travel from One area to another area . (Suppose that I will go from New York to another one then I will need to buy ticket, like $110)",
            "I liked this game so much but i want new job places like a bank,a post office, a office,a police station,etc.And why is not there any fire department,bus station,etc from where we can take the job.We shouldn't be able to take parked vehicles without its keys. There should more of job like buildings which we can go inside to take keys of the vehicle(for rent) parked for the job.After any job is done we should only be able to get money by collecting it from its departmentbyparking itsvehicle back",
            "I rate five stars not because it's a generally good game, but because it's very janky and it's just perfect. But add more houses, a larger open world, and melee weapons. Thanks!",
            "I agree I would like to see more buildings, houses, and countries but overall I enjoy this game."

            "Every five seconds there is an ad. Make a mistake? Well, gotta wait 30 seconds for an ad to play. Immediately make another mistake 4 seconds after resuming play? There's another 30 second ad. And that's on top of all the other ads. I was initially very excited to play this, because I used to play a very similar game on Steam about ten years ago. If this app didn't interrupt you every. Five. Seconds. With. An. Ad. It might be a lot of fun, but it's unplayable. Uninstalled after 20 minutes. :(",
            "This might possibly be without a shadow of a doubt the worst game I've ever played this year and the high reviews I am convinced those are bots and will be reporting this there's no way anyone can get any pleasure from ads the dancing game. Every two seconds there's an ad they're not even trying to hide this fact. Runaway runaway from the pain and the trash",
            "Fun game if there weren't so many ads! It's an overwhelming amount of ads in every level! I understand that ads are how you make money but you could ease up a little bit! I found even the very first level to be somewhat difficult to pass. Would give a much higher rating if the amount of advertising was decreased even a little bit.",
            "Worse than color hop and tile hop, which are the same idea and by the same company. The only thing about this game that's better is that you don't lose if you miss one of the tiles/balls. But now there are balls of the wrong color set as obstacles, your ball is big enough to hit two of the target balls at the same time (so you lose because one was the wrong color), and the road bends which makes it harder to aim. Without bouncing in tempo (color/tile hop) music is unrelated to timing of ball hit",
            "I hate this now everytime I wanna skip an ad ligitt it keeps on coming with an ad. On the other side it also glitches it doesn't show the balls so I don't know where to go😭! And then THERE WAS AN AD!!! Jeez it's so annoying I turned off the WiFi and... THE AD STILL KEPT ON GOING this is the worst game I've ever downloaded and that's really bad for me because well... I've had alot of really really absolutely terrible bad apps but this is the worst of them so plz take my ADVICE DON'T DOWNLOAD IT"

And now they keep telling me I need to buy the upgraded version if I want to use something. I already did like I said I turned into the Developers, nothing has changed so far. I should have stuck with the free! You get one star because I had to give it to you!",
            "Use to really like this app but now it's just slow so slow I had to wait five minutes for it to switch to another item. Use can use everything then when you finally get it the way you want and go to save it says it's premium and deletes your looks. Maybe you can be nicer to us who can't pay for premium and tell us what is premium instead of having us guess.",
            "I've used this app for quite a very long time now, and not until recently (yesterday to be precise) did I notice that an update I choose to call *super*, is available. The old one was awesome, but this new one (updated one), is super awesome. Kudos to youcam makeup team, I love every part of this app. Please keep up the good work.👍👍👍👍👍",
            "I really like this app it lets you try different eye shadows and hair colors plus fix whatever flaw you may feel you have about your face. Lots of preset makeup looks to select from. What do you have to lose for goodness sake, download and make yourself beautiful or just find what colors or different styles look good on you.",
            "I love this app very much it has so many make up things to do so,i would like to tell every body to install this app it takes pictures also very nice my favourite camera is YouCam Makeup . I always use this app to take pictures my mother also love this app very much it dosen't have any side-effects also but when we go to look it need wifi or data to work so this app is so much fun every type of colours lipsitck,eyeliner , eyeshadho , founddation ......etc so from my side. Five 5 stars.to it."

Please try and fix this as soon as possible. Else this is the best chat app I have ever used. Oh and I recognised a new fault in it, When using the app or web app. It takes time to load on older computers and pcs which takes hours to load due the security.",

In mobile app to the caching of app state is buggy, and hide content on app switch dosent work, all it does is just shows the older app state. there are many more bugs but for the time being it that's the most I want to write. And add a feature to unfriend.",

            "Amazing. Couldn't like it more! I like the fact that you can create and record your own music. I also like that there are tutorials availiable to anyone who wants to become a 'pro' I am really impressed with this. I have downloaded many other music making apps, but none have been as good as this! I recommend this to anyone!",
            "Very Awesome! Sadly, I would like to exceed the ratings' limit. I suggest that, the A&B drum pad could be played at once, that you don't have to click the change button \"A(B)\". All in all, it's great! I am grateful. Btw, I am just playing it for free and have no knowledge about drum pad. I am just a passerby",
            "Amazing music! It's a fine piece of art, multiple choices of genre, but I'd like to suggest a new music genre or type. I want a custom DooM soundtrack, DooM is a game for rip and tearing, well. It's basically a fighting game but with tons of blood, you're in hell and you fight demons, all that stuff! And the music is amazing. It is metal. And I wanted to make my own DooM soundtrack with this amazing app! Please read this, And thank you!",
            "This app is free. But they have now added so many ads that you cannot change what it on your screen without getting one. Launch the app. Get an ad. Then an ad banner on the bottom. Download a new drum pack. Get an ad. Load that pack. Get an ad. Then ad banner on bottom permanently. Back out of drum pack. Get an ad. Download new one. Get an ad. The cycle continues until you buy the premium version. Feels dirty.",
            "*EDIT: IF YOU PAID FOR NO ADS GET A REFUND.*Simple and fun! Minor issues plague it from being as great. Random delays in sounds is a big issue especially when recording. Major issue is not having the ability to have more granular control over tempo. If I want to slow a beat of 125bpm to half speed, I have to settle for either 60 or 65, so the pre-recorded rhythmic sounds will either be to slow or too fast. I already pay annually and would gladly pay more for a \"Pro\" mode for this feature alone."

Squash that, this is that new normal, that next paradigm. So let me drop a dime, in the phone(cellular). I made this song in one night, during a fight, between me and my wife. I didn't have any time, but it came out sublime, wife'ys calling it a crime, gold it glows, but silver it shines, 9 times. Outta ten..zen",
            "This app rewards people for copying and singing over other artists vocals. It also rewards the same 10 - 15 people every week. Admin don't reply to queries and they also don't stick to the rules. The same rules they expect their users to stick to. If you make your own cover art and mix your own tracks Its like you're less likely to be rewarded. They also judge tracks even tho they don't make music which means they don't even know what it takes to make tracks.",
            "Not bad! I like the concept of the app and it's pretty dope. Wish there were more functions. I've been waiting to relaunch my YouTube channel and music too so this was a pretty good idea to start networking. Try it out. They have samples and demos and easy to use",
            "I love this app but right now its giving me a hard time trying to use special features like I usually would it does not even let me see the words at the bottom to apply it... whats going on with the app??? And yes I am a Suscribed member for the year.",
            "The app is decent, still room for improvement though. How about adding a info bar so the producers can give details about the song structure, bpm, and instrumental etc? I have been wanting to write songs for the longest, but without that info i cannot do it."

            "Saw an ad for game with puzzles, wanted to do the puzzles.... It's a PVP heavy MMORPG! The puzzles advertised don't exist. Lies, all lies! Update: Devs even lied in their response: the puzzles that do exist stop at lvl 17, out of 35, and they are nothing like those in the ads. I've been playing for over a month, they don't just pop up out of nowhere. This is a common complaint in world chat.",
            "I'm an adult and this game is a lot of fun! I initially downloaded it for points for another game and now I've almost forgotten the other game! This game is exciting at times and working with other people around the world toward a common goal makes it even more fun to play. I love the events!",
            "It's a scam! The puzzles are the main reason why many players join but they are a very small part of the game, and the designers haven't even finished half the puzzles! There are multiple connectivity and login issues per week, and it will cost you an incredible amount of either time, money, or sanity to progress. The one redeeming quality is meeting people from all over the world, but that's offset by frequent issues during high volume events. Want puzzles? Play something else like Fishdom!",
            "I still have the same trouble with one of the puzzles in-game. I can't get past it no matter what I try to do. Now I no longer go to the Puzzles, because the game won't allow me to as I hit the Skip button, and can't go to the next puzzle. The game is stuck on that puzzle. I even tried to go to another area in the Puzzles, and I am not able to access them either at this time. PLEASE FIX, AND UPDATE THE GAME TO ALLOW MT TO PASS THIS ONE. THE KIP BUTTON SHOULD ALLOW ME THEM.",
            "HUGE TIME AND MONEY SINK! DON'T INSTALL!! Do something better with your time like go for a walk, call a friend or family, or get a pet dog. False advertising! Very quickly all the puzzles disappear and it becomes a completely different strategy game which requires you to pay to make significant progress. Oh and if you don't pay to bubble up and protect your city someone who spends more money on this stupid game can destroy all your troops in just one attack. You have been warned."

            "This is the best app of its kind. I go into the settings to manually set the skip silence and I have the best experience for multiple projects. I use this for music, capturing dreams when I wake up, recording important conversations, and sorting out ideas. I've downloaded this on multiple phones, I just wish there was an apple version of it.",
            "It's Great! Does what it says it'll do and so far and especially with as much as I use it, no crashes, glitches or stall outs, (which used to happen a couple of years ago with older version of both app and phone). I've always re-downloaded this app specifically because of its definitive reliability for all that I need it for. It's also a definite 'must have' for interviews, appointments, sessions, and lectures whenever needed. (Only thing I might ask is for more updates playback options) Thanks",
            "Great, simple app that opens quickly, is easy to navigate, and does exactly what it proposes to do and nothing more. When a native recorder was added to Android recently I considered switching to it, but it has a fatal flaw: it's difficult to get your recordings out of it. This app records things to a well-known place that it shows you via its settings.",
            "I've been using this app for a few years now to record song ideas and stuff and they finally asked me to rate it so I decided hell yeah why not this app is a free high-quality recorder and has helped me out immensely and they don't constantly bombard with ads and and ask you to rate all the time I noticed this was the first time they asked maybe they just do that now but anyway I said \"let's do it.\" Hope u like that sentence. 😎 This is my primary recording app and I prefer it over the others.",
            "Why all the high ratings for this I just ran the app and tested the recording quality of talking with my phone locked and my phone was directly next to me and all I got was muffled inaudible garbage. Perhaps it is good for speaking directly into the mic recording but if you need to record a class or something with your phone closed it seems this isn't the app for it. I had high hopes for this app back to the drawing board."

            "I am very new to conding. I love the step by step, move at your own pace format. My only gripe so far. Is that, the only time you pactice coding is when you fill in the blanks. I think it would be better, if the lessons allowed you to copy the code and type it as program are constructed. instead of allowing you to run the code that has already been typed for you. I think I would remember better. If I had done it myself.",
            "SoloLearn is a great study tool for me because it explains concepts in a way that is easy for me to follow and helps me prepare for exams. I also enjoy using it as a tool to help me get ahead in my classes and ensure that I understand the different constraints of programming languages, as well as how they can be used.",
            "This app is Excellent in the ways which it provides a great spectrum on all the programming languages and a coding playground whereby sololearn users can practice codes and execute source codes to get results. Go ahead and Try it for yourself, whether you have a knowledge in programming skills or a beginner in programmimg. I didnt know coding when i started and now I have basic knowledge on all the programming languages that are required for starting your own program.",
            "I'm learning Python 3 really fast! If you honestly want to learn how to code, and you like the idea of tests and interactive lessons, this is definitely the app for you. Sometimes, you can slip off, I get that feeling as it has happened to me before, but if you invest enough time while you're interested, you might just learn enough before the shut down!",
            "Many languages to choose from, but only one lesson for free and you market as a free to learn app is kind of misleading. Also if you're wondering why not a lot of people are learning code is because apps like this one become to expensive to use. It's not a free to use app unless all lessons are free. Other than that I don't know what you're learning because you can't do anything with just variables. Not a lot of people want to learn code because they have to pay."

I also love the water tracker app. I sometimes go a day without drinking water but with this app, im pretty sure im gonna drink a lot of water and stay hydrated. Hopefully i won't have much migraines. Weldone",
            "The app is incredible. I have completed 60 days and now I have started again from beginning. I recommend this app for all those who are above and below age 18. Though my height haven't increased yet I do this daily because exercising everyday is good for health. I hope that my height would increase some day as it depends on each one's body hormones. I have some suggestions for your app. You could add some yogas, some music, the tips of the process of inhalation & exhalation in every exercise. 😘",
            "It is a nice app . I think I can increase my height with this app .It have lot many exercises without any equipment, wow 😍 and have a planned diet and sleep tracker too . It's very helpful app. But the reason of giving it 4 stars is that in diet ,it includes lot many non veg things which I hate 😠😡 actually. You should ask this thing in introduction before planning when you ask about age ,height, etc. It will be better if you do this change. Plzz ,accept my request and do make change.",
            "Amazing i think it is going to be a good trainer and animated images and videos are also given in it. It not only tells about exercise but also about nutrition plus sleep and every exercises are increase and daily new tips of nutrition is also given with it. I think it will increase my height and the further after2 months i will post about it but i liked the app very much😘😘",
            "It's great experience to show how much you can stretch and get height this is my second day training I've grown only just a tiny bit I think but I'm getting their confidencre guys never give up or don't believe always believe in your self. I think this is a helpful review for other people to understand what to do and in all workout apps too."

            "I'm using this app for 5 years specially for picture editing, it used to be the best. But your update sucks. Hope you'll bring back the old, productive and useful interface.",
            "I used to love it, now I hardly use it. Why fix something that's not broken. I don't like that they added unnecessary things to it. I enjoyed being able to put a natural filter, maybe edit out a blemish or two (which now I cannot seem to), and straighten my picture out. It was simple, easy to navigate and use. I don't mind the added filters because they're fun but the rest is too much. Leave the excessive retouching to Facetune, I don't need to make my face smaller, adjust the size of my lips, give myself a face lift, etc. Other have also mentioned the portrait mode, and fine adjustments that we could do back then like adjust separate colors, etc.",
            "This was the only photo editing tool I needed until the update. All I had to do to get a \"perfect\" picture, was go to the facial editing section, put the smoothness to around 40, save & go. Every photo came out looking flawless and still real! Never overdone. Now, if it doesn't recognize a face, you can't even use the facial editing tools. Even if you could, the \"smoothness\" option is gone anyway. I have no use for this app anymore. I don't even know what to download instead. So disappointing.",
            "Updated: This was far better before few updates. The filters were easy to access, there were multiple grain/particle effects in Adjust menu now there's only one; the overall user interface for photo editing was one of its kind before. So, this was my only favorite. Now it's more like other apps like Youcam and Picsart. Hope to see some old features back.",
            "This app is useless. Take one photo, leave it for a few seconds, try to take another photo an dot freezes. Have to click the X 15 damn times to close it and then reopen only to have it crash again. Does the same tying on my other other, does the same thing even after I wiped out the phone three times, does the same thing no matter if I change the storage path from device to chip. The ads are annoying even when I subscribed. The popups for filters are annoying, if I want it I will select it."

            "I love this app. The slimes realistic, and when you tap or drag the screen, the slime reacts as if it was a real slime. It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "This is supposed to be fun, not frustrating or leaving you feeling like you've been ripped off. The new update has changed the payouts on all the games of chance. Even if you get a \"special casino night\" it's a major rip-off. I started out with over 260 diamonds on my \"special\" hour and it took all of my money and my diamonds. I've already decided the \"Star Club\" aint worth it (tried it) The game isn't much fun unless you have diamonds-too expensive -my advice is PASS!! My id is Qpydz542.",
            "I love the game there are no ads in it. You can dress up style yourself your two bff will help you in this journey. Meet many people in the game u can even invite your friends to play with you. But there is 1 thing that I don't like in it that all the things are very expensive gems r less but give amazing dresses that which has to change and there are only 3 eye ball colours and eye shadow colours. Over all it is a lovely and amazing game u should try the game once in your life. 😍😇😁😁",
            "I like it, it's a fun game. I think the price of the clothing cost way to many diamonds, and not enough of them cost cash, mostly everything cost diamonds. And you don't get many with purchase unless you make a large purchase. And the up scale clothing stores should give gift bags. And why do I have to pay for a date? Haha.",
            "I want to take the time to express my thoughts on this very very cool game! I believe that while I am a star member there is really no benefit to it. $19.95 a week is way more then you should be asking for. It is misleading. You still have to spend money to get ahead not to mention the runway battles are REDICULOUS. It is full of cheaters wearing skirts on top of dressed and looking completely silly yet they win. And the ONLY WAY TO BEAT THEM IS TO JOIN THEM HOWEVER IT'S not even fun anymore!!!",
            "I'm irritated that everything that can help you in the Fashion Arena cost diamonds!! I'm irritated that I did the download of that stupid chef game and finished the tutorial but never recieved the reward for it so I had to spend 5 diamonds to skip it so I could continue with the storyline. It sucks that everytime you get \"busted\" in recieving gifts from fans the price of continuing goes up. This isnt a game. It's a money pit!!!"

In addition to what I see the problems are disproportionate. 1.Face looks longer ( Ugly. Too unrealistic) 2. Lower part of the picture always looks bigger(small head with big body) 3. Keeps changing between original look to filtered look even on the video. The entire picture and video look so weird. Are these big problems going to be soon fixed?Yes orNo?"

            "Amazing app. You can create fantastic music with some sounds. I really love this app. But I had one problem: the ads. They were just constantly coming on and I really don't like it. Also, the same ads keep coming on so it's really annoying seeing the same ads over and over again. But keep up the good work on this app because I really REALLY love groove pad (it's one of my favourite apps). I like your song selection too, but maybe could you add some Halloween music to it? I'd REALLY like that!",
            "The app works very well exactly like how you expect it to, but I do have some improvements, before choosing a genre of music, the music takes ages to load so you never know what the beat sounds like before you download that certain beat. Also there isn't a lot of variety either, maybe try a larger range of beats and genres, that will help increase popularity. Anyway it's a great app and if you are looking to make beats either for fun or for business this is definitely for you.",
            "I loved this app and I thought it was great! Only one problem though. The problem was you can't close the app or turn the device off while you are listening to your recorded songs, which I thought was inconvenient. But fortunately, if you have Google Play Music, Groovepad transfers the songs you've recorded onto that app as well, so at least the developers have found a way to make up for the inconvenience. Go Easybrain! 😁😁",
            "It's free, fun, easy to use, and a great way to expand on your creative imagination. Easy to make your own songs and title them. It's as simple as using an electronic keyboard, each key or in this case button, provides a different beat or rhythm and it's very easy to make songs then. Plus there's quite a few sound packs to download for free. If you're looking to make some Beats this is a good app for you.",
            "So far, this is the best music maker app for beginners. For a full layout for mixing, preferably use a tablet. When using a mobile phone, the layout will have two sides of A and B. Would it be possible for the app to allow user to transfer composed music files from one device to another. For example from tablet to mobile phone using the app."

            "Fantastic App There are things that one would like to have though. For instance it would be great if there was offline mode option. There are times when one doesn't want to be disturbed or distracted. One glitch that I experienced is, sometimesI don't see the read (blue ticks) although the recipient have already replied to my message. But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

            "I love the game, but hate the ads. I'd gladly pay to get rid of ads, but I won't randomly throw my Facebook friends under the bus, and that's the only way to get rid of ads - temporarily even. You can leave the option to watch ads to get extra coins or bombs, but let us pay to avoid the pushed ads! Game glitches and splits the drawing in half and doubles it. When trying to play a new player, 80% resign immediately.",
            "30 second ads that you can't skip after EVERY turn is ridiculous. I played it years ago and picked it up again a few days ago. It was much more fun then. Now it's gone way downhill. The word bank is limited, you can't delete games if the other player doesn't take their turn, and it's full of bugs and crashes constantly. Unfortunately, I'll be deleting.",
            "Ads are more intrusive and frequent than any other app. Game is fine, little outdated, but the ads are off-putting, and designed to make you \"accidentally\" click them often. It makes me not want to log in, knowing that over half of my time will be spent waiting for 30 second videos to end. Suggestions: 1) Less ads: offer a way to earn coins to PERMANENTLY remove them. 2) Make it easier to choose colour pallets. 3) Men instantly quit when playing with other men, which is slimy and embarrassing.",
            "they've added a feature where you can run out of ink I have a galaxy note, meaning I have a fairly large screen and a touch pen, so I want to use this game to make elaborate drawings for my friends. For years I'd randomly pick up this game on occasion and always had fun until this time when I ran out of ink and had to send a masterpiece drawing incomplete.",
            "Ads are never fun and this game seems child oriented. The problem is some of the ads may contain some mature target audience content. Good app though. Someone might be crass and draw something inappropriate and the recipient might not be very old which could be bad. Should be an age filter so adults can play with adults and children can play with children. I had some adult words (toyota? Kids not going to know that) and I was playing with my nephews (6 and 9)."

            "Fun game, but the tournaments and the teams ruin the whole thing. In order to place high in the tournaments, you have to spend practically entire weekends on the game because of the poor tournament design. It's also impossible to find an active team, but nobody will join a brand new team. The game should hide inactive teams. If the leader hasn't been on in a while, the team should no longer show up. The tournaments should be unique puzzles, not just how fast you can run through levels.",
            "I love this game. However last week it started crashing every time I tried to open it. There were no updates available and I tried restarting my phone and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app because I didn't know what else to try and it works BUT I'M BACK AT LEVEL ONE!!! I have been playing this for years and was at level 1600 something!! Is there any way to restore at least some of the progress I had made??",
            "Was a great game that I'd play every night to pass the time. Then suddenly the game would hang and freeze for no reason. So I uninstalled and installed the app again, only to discover that not only does it continue to hang and freeze, but now I lost all of my coins and helpers. I contacted support through the app a few days ago and still no response from them. Very frustrating.",
            "The game is good. Only problem is that every other game, you get bombarded with adverts. Now I could let this slip by, if the adverts featured weren't the banned ads of Gardenscapes and Fishdom! While every other game has removed those ads, you've left them in. They were banned for a very specific reason, and that is false advertisement, which is a breach of the false advertising standards. When the ads are removed, I will consider upping my rating.",
            "My longest played game. The visuals are soothing, and not too many ads to distract from the play. Mostly you play against yourself, then occasionally you get a tournament if you are feeling competitive. Very few repeated games, and I've played tons of them. The best thing about the game is the soothing photos though. Ty"

            "The game itself is pretty much explainable I mean, the game is pretty simple to be fair. The levels aren't as difficult as I thought and, the gameplay is straight forward. I do consider having some certain problems with the game itself though, first the Ads. There are Ads every two Levels and it's really disappointing because you have to spend thirty seconds of your time to watch some pointless Ads. (They make you watch Ads for Money..) And, the Levels aren't challenging enough, please fix this!",
            "The game is aussum and very good this is the game of mind how her level are pass the level goes higher and difficult I loved this game. Good job And please ad very angry but do more facilities such as if we will Completed the level we will something eg coins and from that coins we can take sometimes I game please make the level more interesting .Good content . Actually some words I don't get understand so I need to search of Google what does it means but it's ok I will know new words.",
            "The game itself is good, like it's a good little puzzle game to pass the time, but it's just unplayable due to all the adds. I got 4 adds before it let me complete the first level, then 2 straight after completing it. Fair enough stick a couple ads in now and then, but this is just ridiculous.",
            "These game is awesome. but i give a 4 stare beacaus for the adds. but there is away to not get adds also a hake. its easy just tiren of the connection thien no adds free . but for that the game is cute and awesome and i hope these review is helpful. AND BYE AVRYBODY!!!!!!!!!!",
            "This game is fun but the amount of ads is excessive! I mean an ad after every level, and after level 3, T H R E E, a message pops up and asks me to rate the game. This was so annoying, I clicked on the link and here I am. My rating will go up when the amount of ads go down ⬇️"

            "I have no problem with this game. Others say it has about 50 million ads every day, with a 3 star rating or under. The only thing I dislike, are the glitches. But that one problem isn't going to put me off this game for life like it will with all the other whimps out there. I have had tonns of apps and games with ads, but the only reason I felt like deleting them is to download other more fun and popular games I see thanks to the games with lots of ads. So, ads aren't really that bad after all.",
            "Nice casual game. When I have nothing to do i simply open it and it entertains me. But man by every update they are increasing the difficulty. So i want to tell the developers that this game has an image of refreshing and casual game. So the more difficulties you add the more people will not play it. So better for you guys, Make it more entertaining not difficult.",
            "This is such a relaxing game! The ads aren't so bad, cause well, which game doesn't have ads? The only issue I have with the game is that the sounds play whenever the media volume is raised, and they don't stop despite muting them in the settings bar. That's really annoying tbh, and the only reason why I wouldnt give this 5 stars",
            "It is an amazing and addictive game. Really easy to use and child friendly. There are games in which their ads show that the game is like this and this how to use it but then it is different to use.In this game, it shows the true usage of this and the ad is true. This is the most favourite of all time.😘😘😍😍",
            "Ads are one thing, but what they do is after you finish a level, they will offer you a free upgrade if you watch an ad within 10 seconds of clicking it. But even when you decline it, when you try to manually upgrade your character, you are given a free upgrade and you can ONLY upgrade if you FORCEFULLY watch an ad. Get that trash out of your apps you plugs."

            "Like several others here, this game has quit loading. It absolutely will just go dark after trying to load the game. Look, I spend money every month on this game, and I have unlocked some special characters as well as bolstered most all of my super rares. Also, as I read these reviews, I dont see anyone being responded to by any of the developers, and I hope this isn't the norm. Please advise.",
            "I really like this game and everything it has but my game is too laggy sometimes, and my internet connection is fine. And make this game offline Also here are some things I think should be added 1.choosing the map you want to play on. 2.being able to play with your friends by creating some kind of server. And 3. Upgrade price. I upgraded a common Amy and for some reason, the next upgrade costed 400 rings and the first one was 100. Also, I'm part of Team Knuckles and we're getting beat by simps.",
            "If you like Sonic Games, so you have to try this intresting game!!! A very very good game, but there is an AD after every match... But then also I liked the game very much. As the events are interesting. And Charecter have a special power that can be used in between the battle.",
            "Changing my rating, I'm tiring of the issues it has kept. One, the matchmaking system. Statistics don't seem to matter when it comes to matchmaking. Two, trophy rewarding. You could first the entire game, slip up once, and lose 20+ trophies from it, with everyone else gaining some. Three, characters. Special characters I find very unbalanced disregarding levels. Finally, the moment you leave Tier 7, it's madness. I played for a year and unlocked all but one character. It was fun at one point..",
            "I play this religiously when I'm at work. I have great connection but somehow still see the connection status displayed on the screen even when I'm at home and that wifi is state of the art. Also hearing ads during gameplay, hitting opponents but they still keep going, (and thats without shield before you say something stupid) and laggy. Big can use his water spout move but can't see the pad underneath it? Where is the water shooting from? Good thing I don't pay to win. I'd be wasting money!!!!!"

            "The game is great, is just that, there is way too many microtransactions, for example, if you want to upgrade your piggy bank, it costs $3.00 to upgrade. If the microtransactions wasn't there I'd give this 5 stars, but then again since there is a lot of microtransactions in this game, I'm giving this 4 stars but overall, ganeplay, is great and the experience is great too.",
            "This game was awesome and very addictive. You can play offline and collect character cards by earning trophy. The only thing that makes it less exciting is that the characters were too quiet. The only thing you can hear was the weapon's shooting, the music, and the scorer's/announcer's voice. It would be more exciting if the character could atleast say a word or make a noise. That way, we can really feel the goosebumps while playing it. The game was so incredible and needs a voice for characters",
            "I play this game for a while and overall is doing great. Until I found some player who has a nearly immortal character. I'm not sure if he cheat or not, but I shoot with a sniper right to the head more than 20 bullets, and the HP doesn't even lower (especially from player with Indian flag) and some player who can deal very high damage that could destroy a base in just a couple shots. Please find out and fix these problems.",
            "Love this game, the graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is good, the cards are unique. The only trouble that I have with this game is the 2v2 button and matchmaking. Apparently, I am unable to 2v2 with my friend and matchmaking just sometimes became rude to me and match me against higher levels than me. But overall, I am in love with this game.",
            "Dude, you said you fix your bug problem. Are you sure, because when I try to find a match and press cancel, it went take me back to my home page. You have to fix that. Otherwise this game is pretty fun and interesting. But I suggest you to fix the bug and add some buff to some weak character. When matchmaking, try to find match within our level, sometimes the difference is way to big, and that leads to an unfair game. And when the character event came out, let us choose what we want to use.😀😀"

            "I remeber about 5 or so years ago this game was really differant, but don't take that the wrong way, the skins now are really cool and the map almost seems larger! The only thing I would change is to add back some of the old skins, because I thought they were fun and that way you would get more of a variety, because now there isnt as many skins as there used to be, and you have to play, ALOT to get some of the new skins, but this game is super cool and really addictive!",
            "Well, sadly, it used to be 5 stars and not loads of ads. I changed it to 3 stars after there were way too much ads and not only too much, there started to be gross, bloody, inmature ads that is not good for a kid to watch. I feel like now that I wrote a good 5 star review a few days ago about good ads, the developer thinks that I will be ok with the types of ads now. Its fine most of the time but I had to write a bad review after there was an ad that had bees stinging ladys and showing blood.",
            "This game is really good but I played it a few years ago and it was way better of course it's a good game but the skins a few years ago were better and didn't have to unlock them also I thought of was more free or something, I think that's just me though. This is a good game though and I love it ❣️",
            "I like this game . Its a wonderful game because while starting we will be small and while killing others and we will get longer and longer so I love this game .. so....…. Come on and download this game and start. Play but we cant able to play this game in online . But this is a good game to play. So… I like this game 🤗🤗🤗 and my high score is 14000. This was new. Game i was happy",
            "I love his very addictive fun exciting game, however I would of gave it a 5 if the ads where tuned down a bit, I mean too many ads and it would be better and more fun if there was only like 1 ad for 5 games, I would love it, but gotta say I love the new update.👉👈"

Again, I enjoy this app but l'm just tired of looking for ways to answer clearly and that the questionaire with understand it more because of the problem. Thank you for this application",
            "This app is amazing. From the time that I had downloaded it , I cannot stop using it . It has provided me all the answers that I have ever searched (even maths with proper explanation) . You might not get ur answer some times so u can post a question and get an answer from other users. So you should definitely try this app. It will really help you alot🏆📖📚📑🎒",
            "The old version was very useful. But this one is not user friendly. Audio questions are only in hindi, if i ask in english it started to type in Hindi . And also the scan and solve option is also not working correctly, if i ask a question, it is diverting to other questions. The old version was very useful. I don't know what is happening in the new version.",
            "The app is awesome. The problem is with the latest version of android. There is a bug. Eveytime i work with formula tab, the app crashes. Also you can make improvements towards making inserting formulas much more easily and conveniently. The idea of app is good . I myself contributed answers. Please fix this issue as soon as possible in next update at earliest.",
            "This is a really great app! Ever since my modules came, I had trouble answering them. When I searched on Google for one of my questions, I found this app. I downloaded it and it is amazing! Random people started answering my questions, not only have I got my answers, but new friends as well. I hope this app wouldn't have any problems in the future. Thanks!"

I though I would hate it cuz oh its another runner game woo hoo, but I thought it was more fun than many runners because you have the choice to do endless running and you have the chance to do the missions, and plus you get to beat the Akuma. I just want more levels to play, thats the only reason why I'm only doing 4 stars.",
            "This game is sooooo Miraculous! I absolutely looooove Miraculous! This game really suites me! Thank you Crazy Labs for making this game! And thank you Zag for making this show! But...it lags very much sometimes when I try to jump over or slide under or go on the other side it doesn't follow my instructions ! It's a great game but please do something about the lags! I can't even play level 50 because of the bugs!",
            "I love this game, Actually I have downloaded it atleast 10times in my phone I love the way u decorated it and the characters I'm giving you 4 stars instead of 5 stars because when I used to download it first time(2 years ago) and that time I have cleared all 80 level but till now the level are norlt upgraded we want new level new villians and also twists...",
            "Wow so many ads! They weren't kidding when they said in app purchases and ads. Every time you restart a level or finish a level there are ads. And then they want $7.99 a WEEK for a subscription to get rid of the ads. Cute game, fun and kinda addictive but I'd rather just pay a flat one time fee than a weekly fee cause it ain't that good of a game for 7.99 a week! I'll probably delete it here soon.",
            "I really like the game it really nice but I give it a four stars cause it's not whay I expected it's really easy and every level is fast also at the photobook the name of them are misplaced and you also need membership to get bunnyx and ryuko and VIP mission but it's an amazing game. Still waiting for the one like on gamer 2.0 if they'll release one, crossing my fingers for yes🤞"

            "My experience with this app has been a very positive one. This is my fall back app to watch movies when cable TV gets stale. I like to escape in an entertaining movie and can usually find that here. Many older and off the wall movies which works perfectly for my taste. Also some newer movies available. The ads are few and placed about every 20 minutes or so with 1 to 3 at a time. Much better than any other service period. Broadcast TV and cable TV should learn from this. Highly recommended !",
            "Tubi is a good app. I had to change to a tablet, and why did I do that. Now I cannot watch anything without that condemned little circle going round and round every 10 seconds🥶😬😬 Now I know we already have at least 3 ads going on in between recesses. These are still ok. But that blasted circle really gots*to*go. I don't know how its gonna happen, but its gotta go. If I cannot watch the movies, it makes no sense keeping the App. Same thing happened on a different phone. I'm hoping for the best",
            "I like that I can pause or fast forward. I miss being able to hit the continue watching part because I usually have limited time and then have to start the show over. For example I was in season six of my kitchen rules and for whatever reason the continue watching part was removed and now I have to rewatch episode one or fast forward several seasons to get back to where I was.",
            "I'm surprised by this app. I didn't think I would like it, but, thanks to the new chromecast with Google tv, I'm trying streaming apps I wouldn't have before. The ads aren't too frequent, and they don't last more than 2 minutes total. And the content is pretty diverse -- a nice supplement to the paid subscriptions I have. I just wish 1. The navigation was a bit smoother/more intuitive, and 2. I could exclude certain types of ads (such as political) from my account.",
            "It was a great app I had no trouble. I for some reason the app is not working you should delet it and intall it again. Other wise it is juast google play. It happened to me and I just donlowed it again and it worked. The other time it was every thing in google play that was not working so the app is perfectly fine and great. I am giving it five stars."

            "Block craft is an amazing game! I only see a few problems. When I watch a add for more blocks it does not give me my prize.Please try to fix this! Also I would like to add a friends list so you could vistit your friends village. Besides that it is a really exfun game! Also can you buy things with your coins? That would be very helpful! I dont have any gems. One more thing. It gets pretty upseting when you run out of blocks. Its best if you don't level up. You really should get this game!",
            "Well Personly this game is AMAZING and you can build WHATEVER YOU WANT! So i recomend to play this game and Going to the build button on the right and clicking it, it gives you many different options when you level up you'll see more buildings and so you can build yourself your own personal house and stuff so i hope you have fun playing this game!",
            "Block Craft 3D is a nice game. You could get ideas from other's villages. You could buy pets, doors 🚪, and some others. But please 1 tiny thing. Can you fix the credit card issue. Cause I'm 10 and I don't have a credit card number. Way far from that, I love the game and Thank you!",
            "The game keeps closing for no reason and it's annoying when it gets stuck and when you are walking it makes you go through the building or through the wall. The cool part is that you don't have to build stairs. if you build a tall building and a single file building on that wall if you take out two blocks and stand under it and place on block under your avertar you will go right to the top of your building almost like an elevator",
            "Bad game You can't fly without paying, There is no survival mode, you can RUN OUT of blocks in creative mode, you have to wait 2 and a half hours to get them back. Speaking of blocks, you only get like 40 blocks for free. You can unlock a maximum of 20 blocks at a time for an unreasonable price. Bad game. Did I mention that you can't sneak?"

            "I read tarot but don't always have the cards with me. The cards are accurate in their placement and as long as the person reading has their own context clues, the reading will be quite good. And the more I use this app, the more I appreciate all its features. Try out some of these different paths. I love the different spreads and will probably add some of then to what I do now. Even the ads are not intrusive. Very manageable. I am very grateful for this app.",
            "I love it. Fun, interesting & spot on with most of it. As it goes... \"Tarot never lies\". Its amazing how accurate these are. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose. Hope it works as well for others as it does me & people around me who try it from my phone. Mind blowing! Take what you read on the light side, not too serious. Its great.",
            "This app has so far been good. I don't have any problem using it every day 😅. Nevertheless, I would urge the creator to add one more special feature about moon & sun signs astrology😭, besides having the horoscope section. 😎😇 It will also better the app.",
            "That was actually spot on. I'm new to tarot but catching on quick. I have had paranormal experiences my entire life. Have seen 6 UFOs. Dreams I remember having, that give me deja vu, witch always have to do with future events in my life and are almost exactly the same. Plus I'm pretty good at predicting cards with shapes. Not sure what all that means and have been searching for answers my entire life. Tarot makes a lot of sense to me and so far it's been a positive tool in my life.",
            "First use was soooo accurate. I was able to connect with two friends spiritually and that's exactly what it read. Also, it said If I start a new business soon, I can accomplish it. Weirdd because I've been debating since last year and just these past few months about starting my own..."

            "Such a shame, could have been a really cool puzzle game, but there's just far too many ads.. It's literally ridiculous.. I get that you guys have got to make money.. But forced adverts after almost every completed level, plus a banner at the bottom. Is just pure overkill and greed. I played about 6 or 7 levels and just gave up.",
            "I don't normally review games based on their ad count because devs need revenue, but this one needs it to be considered. The game is simple, which is exactly what I signed up for, but a simple game combined with an ad after every 2 second puzzle is just frustrating and discouraging. It feels like a cash grab. The game itself, while incredibly easy, is alright. I was looking for a good stimulating timewaster, and I ended up with an ad exhibition with breaks sometimes. No thank you, I'm deleting.",
            "It's fun, but the ads are ridiculous. You take 5 seconds to beat a level, then have to watch a 30-60 second ad. There should ALWAYS be more gameplay than ads, NOT the other way around! Also, it's very obvious that some patterns get reused over and over, either that or, after a certain number of levels, they start over from level 1.",
            "The idea of this game is pretty cool but the puzzles are really easy and sometimes they repeat. There are ads after each puzzle, if you're really lucky, sometimes you get 2 before an ad. The good thing is that they made the ads skippable but they're still just as annoying, especially because the puzzles only take seconds to complete. If you can handle the ads then this is a good time waster but if you're looking for something stimulating then keep looking cuz they dropped the ball on this one.",
            "A fun enough expirence because ot was free. I personally disconnect from wifi because I read from other reviews that there were too many ads. But I was able to cycle through all of the levels in under 15 minutes. And they REALLY aren't very hard. I know these games are probably meant to pull in children but I'm a 20 year old man and this really didn't cut it for me :/ didn't have glitches or anything but still a sad expirence. It never really elevates in difficulty."

            "THE best \"bubble pop\" I've played so far (about 10 which have been uninstalled). It's actually challenging at the higher levels and it took me 5 tries to get 5 stars just on level 20! Not only that but the number of ads you have to endure seem to be related to how well you do for completing each level. I went through a dozen or so levels without watching a single ad. But then it became clear that 3 stars for 100,000 pts and 3 stars for 300,000 pts is very significant . Not for the braindead!",
            "The last 2 updates by developer were the same old version till level 665 and nothing beyond. Why released those useless updates then ?",

            "The first problem is the puzzles are far too simplistic to be entertaining. Finishing them does not provide any kind of sense of accomplishment. The biggest problem is that this is another app that exists as an engine to vomit ads at you that stop any media currently playing. Listening to a podcast? Not when one of these ads starts. And there are so many of them. Fail the puzzle? Here's an ad. Did you win? Congratulations here's an ad. In 10 minutes if game I spent over 5 of it watching ads.",
            "Very easy, mindless game. Very little skill required. Has a lot of noisy adds, many with no volume off button, so don't play at work for a mindless break. Many adverts crash the game, resulting in having to replay the last round. I've lost interest now. Levels never get hard, & repeat earlier rounds. Boring.",
            "A Little bit inane. Not much difficulty @ higher levels. It took abiut 15 minutes to reach level 45. Most of the time was taken up by adverts for other games. Realising it is your bread and butter to have a multitude of games available, and being played, with adverts inserted from time to time, but not at every level change whilst progressing through the game. I suggest (example) don't attempt or try to get people to role play, when they are playing logic or puzzle games.",
            "This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately that potential is negated by the total overuse of advertisements, a level taking 5 seconds is then followed by up to 40 seconds of advertisements... deleted, Yes I understand the manufacturers of the game have to make a living and advertisements is their way of doing so, but taking the fun out of the game is not the way forward😥",
            "Do you like puzzles that are very, very, very simple? Do you like spending lots of your time watching ads? If so, this might be the app for you. I actually find that I do play it from time to time. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mindless winning with no effort. The game eagerly congratulates you after every simple win. I'm on level 353 now, so obviously I've spent some time playing it. It doesn't get any harder. A couple of the last few levels I played were literally un-losable."

A really nice app and I recommend this for every student. If u feel like a lot of ads are disturbing you, you can just switch off the internet connection. Works with my phone, not sure if it works with yours.🤔",
            "I'm so happy that you add the feature that you can collect coin in every correct answer and buy another option. The app itself is great buttons are well made, no delay and no lag. Speaking of adds, i don't have problem with it. Speaking of 'tricks' I already mastered some of those and can actually solve mentally. Ps: I just used it for one day. How much more If i use this for so long? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP. For developer of this app. I want you all to congratulate for this masterpiece. Gb",

            "It's an amazing app! It teaches you how to solve math questions in the simplest and easiest way and also tests you on what you have learnt. This is really an app I'll recommend if you want to improve your marks in mathematics and take it into a whole new level! The best part about it is that it is free! Hats off to the developer for creating this wonderful app. 😄😄😄",
            "It's a mind blowing app. I'll recommend every one to install the app. It comprises of millions of tricks, which are really helpful. It also contains many Maths problems, which help us to understand the tricks better. It contains Maths games and multiplication table. Thanks a lot to the app developer for developing this outstanding app."

            "I love this app and how easy it is to use. Of note, though: if you have a magnetic case on your phone, take it off before you use this app. It kept giving me the sky for Central Africa when I'm in Arizona, USA! I love that I can turn features on and off, and the night vision is great for studying the night sky. Great for a layman like myself!",
            "I LOVE this app. I think it's great. The compass works really really well, and it's usually pretty accurate when it comes to finding stars and constellations. My one complaint is that when I click on a notif it doesn't show up anywhere in the app. So if I see a notif and I don't read what it says or I don't really understand what it's saying I can't find out more about it after the app opens. If this one thing was fixed it would be 5/5 perfect app.",
            "Just wish there were more options, such as when I see a notification I can close it but when the time comes I can see it again. I would also like to toggle back and forth from seeing the constellations' outlines to just seeing the stars. Overall it is a pretty cool experience when you are out in the open fields of rural Canada and can see a stellar experience.",
            "Great app. Fun way to introduce my children to the wonders of the night sky. Just started astro photography, helping me find Galaxies of interest. My first stacked image turned out extremely well. Family and friends were very impressed.",
            "A great app with plenty of detail & easy to use. It seems to be a lot more accurate than other similar apps I've tried. The only thing that seems to be missing is a red filter so your night sight isn't affected by looking at it. This would make it perfect & 5 stars."

            "I really like the idea, the art is very nice. Everything feels natural with the controls. The one thing I DONT LIKE is that it feels like a tutorial for 29 levels and then level 30 took me by surprise. It was a fun challenge. But a steep jump in difficulty progression. Once again, a great game which deserves 5 stars, but tweaks could be made to better user experience!",
            "Would be a good game if they didn't just repeat the same puzzles over and over again, just flipping and reversing previous levels. It's dumb. Also you can't go back to previous levels you can only play the one you're on and the difficult ones come maybe once in 50 levels. Boring. And since it's a VOODOO game, you know you have to turn off your data and wifi otherwise you'll be hit with a ridiculous amount of ads... At least one after each 10 second level...",
            "Good concept, decent design, crappy execution. I think it's relaxing, and it'd be fun if the ads weren't so intrusive, it didn't constantly repeat levels, and if there was actually thought put into the puzzles. Half of the time you can't actually make any choices. You just move the ball on a track. The other half it's very random feeling. There's no ramp up in challenge. Some of the first levels are repeated much later in the game.",
            "You must work on levels. how come level 139 is as easy as level 1.. It seems its just showing up any random level and back button does not work when you are playing a level... you cannot go back to level listing. I could play this game with absolutely no mind involved. Its like drawing doodles on a blank paper. and after some time. people will just delete it out of boredome. Seems like work of someone new with game dev. well if that is the case. Keep it up. Consider players' perspective.",
            "The first time I played this game it was pretty cool good but as I played it more I realized that the levels became easier.... I hate the game now. Even though level 20 and 15 look \"hard\" their really easy so umm.... Why do people even give this five four three stars? ;-; I'm honestly disappointed well done to the people who tried and are enjoying the game. Oh and to many ads!.. the same fricking and keeps playing again (x2) So like um the ads are way to much"

            "I give this app 4 stars because I love doing all the puzzles. My frustration with this app is that it freezes more times then any other app I've used, plus it froze for more than a week to where I couldn't get in to play so I had to uninstall and now I have to redo each of the puzzles again and I do about 20 or more puzzles a day so a little frustrated with that part.",
            "I really enjoy your puzzles, and I play them specially when I want to relax, but it freezes up more than once on each puzzle and it becomes frustrating. Please fix the bug as I see I'm not the only one with this issue. I am using an Android tablet to do the puzzles. Hope this helps figuring out why all the freezing up.",
            "Not crazy about the recent update. Game can only be played in portrait mode now, which is awkward. Game opens with puzzle piece size on 42 as the default, which I never use. Game also has glitch now where a puzzle occasionally can't be be completed due to one piece appearing smaller than the others and unable to be dragged and dropped into place...weird. ***Also, even though I paid $9.99 for the Premium version, it runs ads now and they will not refund my money.",
            "I (as many other players) have bought the ad-free version of this game. Ever since the last update, I (as many other players) have been getting ads. The \"Restore Purchases\" DOES NOT work. Please fix!!!!!!!!!!! or please forward this message to your service team. Thank-you. I used to love this app, playing this to help destress. The ads which I am unable to get rid of is giving me more stress. Sadly, uninstalling this app.",
            "Amazing jigsaw puzzle with an excellent user interface, beautiful graphics and many options. The premium version gives a full screen puzzle Crashing constantly after the layout change update. Reinstalling has not improved performance and my purchased picture packs freeze downloading. The last Android system update has corrected the download and play stability problems. Works great with many new interesting image packages."

Then they started making money out of the COMMUNITY CONTENT. I'm happy to pay for apps I believe in, but seriously - 95 dollar?! PER YEAR?! I am so disappointed, I'm seriously starting to hate them for what they did. Hope they either drastically change their strategy (like they've been promising for months) or would overthrown by a better, alternative app.",
            "I like that it is easy to communicate with people, not I'm learning simple Thai word with in just 2 days!! People here are amazing!! And also It's easy to learn the app instructions.",
            "It's good for quick grammar help, but the paid for feature is a total rip off. The community isn't large enough to make it worth it, people will see your question regardless. The balancing of what should be a free feature and what should be premium is poor. I featured one of my questions, and it took over 10 hours for a response which didn't exactly answer the question. Meanwhile I asked 3 questions unfeatured, and they all got a response in 30 minutes and were super helpful.",
            "Nice app if you can't go out/don't know/don't want to speak to native people in person. I think this is perfect for shy or extremely introverted people, but please allow us to change our votes in the poll(to answer the question,\"does this sound natural?) before posting.",
            "Please bring back the \"does this sound natural\" feature to the free version. It was the only reason why I kept using this app in the past few months. Now I am stopped behind a pay-wall."

            "Wow! I am so impressed with this App! It's very easy to use. It shows you how to do the exercises and it even counts the seconds for you!!! It's definitely motivating! Thank you for such a great app!!! The only thing I can't work out is how to use it on my IPad or laptop. It connects with my google account and phone thats it..... Be great if someone could help me get it on one of those devices please! 🙂",
            "I LOVE this app. It's AMAZING! There are exervcises for every training. You can even do exercises in your bed and office. This is so convenient and it also tracks your exercise and reminds you to drink water. I absolutely reccomend this app. It also helps you loose weight and keep you fit. Definitely recommend downloading this! Keep up the great work! 👍",
            "Fantastic app with great fitness features! Way better than an app I paid 20$ for 3 months for. Ladies, give this a try. I'm finding myself doing a bit more and more each day. It's fun, easy, and comprehensive, yet challenging when you're comfortable taking that next step and increasing your duration and intensity. Very user friendly: great pause/stop functions and additional direction when you need a move or pose explained in greater detail. I should of just went with this!",
            "Best of all. I have came across several apps to give me a proper plan to stick on. Out of all this is the best. Honest opinion. I wondered how it got high ratings and I downloaded. Ended up giving high rating😂 Pretty sure you will fall in love with this app. Ads aren't that disturbing and the UI is pretty descent. Be honest with the app and it will give u a very good result. Go on with it.",
            "I thoroughly like this app, I do have one issue but it isnt enough to drop a star in my rating. I would like the option to enter in workouts I have done not on the app. I do 20 minutes of cardio every morning and would like to track that with the rest of my things on the app. I will add the water reminder is incredible to have. I hate water and will go days without 1 sip other than to brush teeth so this is a huge help. Over all I enjoy using the app."

            "Wow. I am hooked. Since I started playing this game early on in the lockdown I got two of my buddies hooked as well. The game helps me build analogies to two story telling (the journey of the colour dots, their character arcs and what not) and strangely I can see parallels to approaching life as the relationship between various dots that occupy every spot on the board.",
            "I have played this game for years. There is a wide variety of levels of different diffculties, shapes and sizes. Game works on a variety of different devices; phones and tablets. Highly recommend as a casual game to help pass some time. At the bmv? Flow. Long line in a store? Flow. Passenger on a long car ride? Flow. Bored with current level set? Go to a different level set, BOOM, continue Flowing. You can Flow anywhere, anytime. I love this game ❤",
            "I absolutely love this game! It's addicting to me. I've played every board, made sure every level was a perfect play, including all the extra packs I unlocked. I really wish there were some new packs for this game. I used to play this game for hours when I was bored. I miss all the nights where it would keep me up at night in bed while my phone was illuminated with Flow. I could think clearly because there were no distractions in bed. The only medal I need to get is the 365 day player goal.",
            "Such a fun and sometimes challenging game. I can and have spent hours playing this game. It's an excellent time killer, and it's really entertaining. I have completed all the levels, and restarting it felt like an entirely new experience. I could go on forever about the variety of levels and how much I enjoy this game, but I won't. Just trust me when I say that I you're into fun and interesting puzzle games, you'll probably like this one! 😀",
            "I love this game, and I have been playing it for years. One thing is that it's great to pass time or just listen to music but still have something to do with your hands. I have the full version, so I'd love it if paid and free packs were uploaded every once in a while (but kind of frequently because you can get through them pretty fast). I know there are other versions with more packs, but I don't want to pay more for every full version. :)"

            "So over all it is a very good learning experience. The courses are planned wel and it seems that the developers put a large amount of work into this. But as a subscription app that is not that cheap. I has some very frustrating bugs. In the Dutch course you don't have the char ' that is very important for spelling and there is no way around it. And the speaking practice is really bad sometimes that I have gave up using it in the last 2 months. Without those few bugs I would give it 5/5",
            "I had a weird issue to where it wouldn't let me log in saying \"Try again later\". I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, it seems to have done the trick. I hope this isn't a recurring issue with the app apart from the voice recognition that others were talking about. It's kind of funny what it thinks you say. It thought I said \"Skin store\" instead of \"Stimmt so\". I'll use the other options of reviewing German until voice recognition is fixed. Others should do the same to save any frustration.",
            "This is an awsome app! You are able to learn any language, and you are able to choose if you wanna talk or not, it also tells you if tou should start learning again, or when another level is unlocked! Again like I said the best app ever, I have learned both Spanish and French with this app!",
            "FIXED!!! App doesn't sync lessons completed on the browser. The app itself is great and I've already learnt a lot more in a short time in comparison to other apps because Babbel mixes different topics so it's not boring. That was the thing that slowed my progress before. This app has realistic conversations so you get used to actual language, not just repeating isolated phrases like \"Brot und Wasser\" twenty times like a drill exercise.",
            "Great app but the lessons are too long and sometimes have 2 halves that are seemingly unrelated. Today I learned about trying on clothes and numbers by the hundred. If these had been 2 seperate lessons in the same course, I wouldn't have minded. But it takes so long to do them at the same time and I can't save my progress. Please either split up the lessons or add an ability to save position in a lesson"

            "It was amazing! I've been dealing with this problem where ads were popping up and it was taking me to Google when I wasn't even on Google. I tried to download Norton Malware but I had to pay, but then I downloaded this and it was completely free (except for the premium version). I scanned my apps and there was a hidden adware file. It really helped me out, so I advise you to download!",
            "Paid for premium and within 24 hours I have an error popping up saying 'We've detected a problem with your premium, pleaee contact support'. Contacted support and they've not recognised what I'm trying to say is the problem, wasting money now really. Very upsetting because on all of my computers I'd never recommend anything but Malwarebytes.",
            "Does not run all the time. Sometimes loads at startup sometimes not. No error message so you don't necessarily notice until you see the icon is not showing up in the status bar. This is not good for an AV product. I also run the Windows version with no issues. This is the only issue I have with the product.",
            "This is the very best company and app in existance! Even on the free version these guys are absolutely awesome. I started using this years ago and my Microsoft account on my laptop and they never miss a Beat. The customer service is also excellent. But the app itself does not fail to find any and every problem I've ever had... I'm so glad I found them again!!🦉♥️🌞☄⚡💚💙💜💥 P.S. I tried AVG, and also InCognito, none of them compare. These 2 above, while they are great apps no contest.",
            "Installed due to pop up ads (no, I do not want to meet a hot milf tonight lol) and pleased so far. Used the free trial of the premium version to do a scan, it identified the malware and with a single click it was removed. My phone even seems to be running faster than it was before I noticed the issues. Overall, easy to use, very impressed and if it continues to impress I'd be more than happy to pay for the full version (which is also very reasonably priced, just over £10 for an entire year!)"

            "The extra filters keep disappearing after a couple of weeks or so. I am fed up with constantly having to reinstall them. Am uninstalling. Haven't the time or patience. A great app totally spoiled by what appears to be a very annoying bug. Reinstalled to see if this bug had been fixed. No it has not. Cannot even reinstall the filters now- keep getting \"error\". Seeing as the last update was in May 2018, it makes me wonder if the developers have given up. Just glad I never paid for this.",
            "Completely love this app!!! Photos and videos with amazing filters, plus added special cameras that can do more than standard apps can do! The more you use it, the more filters you gain for free! The only thing i could think to make this app prefect is to be able to create an account (which i normally hate doing) so that there is a way to transfer unlcoked filters to a new device, etc.",
            "I used this one for panorama effect back in the days when phones didnt have panorama filters. At least mine didnt and this app worked wonders for that function. Now not needed anymore tho :/",
            "I love this camera. If you ate looking for filters to edit or take a photo with, then this is the camera for you! Comes with the most free filters I have ever seen and they are gorgeous!",
            "Last updated? Which date? Long back in 2018? I just now installed and the app runs and works also, but few icons seem invisible but still exist.. pls update the app..."

            "It is very good, there is good editing in it, it is available for free in everyone's phone and it also looks good editing the normal photo, but it really takes backup so I liked it This is a gallery, it is very good to save photos and it also has edits, it really keeps updating, so keep updating it, then you get to see new features and I like it too That is why I did not force stop it and I am using it, I would give it 5 stars but due to the lack of any more good features, I will start it only 3",
            "I really can't say that I love the way this app works. It's not at all intutitive. There's such a disconnect between my sd card and my photos on my phone when I'm in the photos app.. I don't really get why this has to be so difficult? It'd be nice if every pic or video the phone has access to (on device or on sd card or in other apps, etc) would just come up when I go into the photos or gallery app. It's like a mystery I have to solve any time I'm trying to work with this app! Thx.",
            "This update is the absolute worst. No longer are the folders small, easy to navigate single pics, but now the first dozen photos from each folder, filling the entire screen, with a tiny label... I can't just tap a pic to open the folder, now I have to scroll through pages to find the folder I'm looking for - plus, other than \"camera,\" everytime I open \"Photos,\" the folders are going n random order - and there's no way to alter or customize the view. Thanks for making garbage! 👍",
            "mostly positive. i like that it keeps my photos on the cloud and that i can use google apps to switch info from phone to phone. but my pixel 3 had an issue with this app where it restarted randomly as i was backing a LOT of stuff up to the cloud and about a 3rd of the photos were corrupted when it started back up again, even on the cloud, even on my phone. also, it says in the description of the app that you can upload unlimited photos and videos for free but you really only get 15 gb",
            "Good. But we need an option where you can manually set some photos to be saved in full resolution and the rest in high quality (free tier). So that the pictures that the user don't want it compressed can be availed in full resolution but the other pictures can be compressed and saved in free tier without using up the GBs allocated to and account. Right now the entire gallery gets uploaded on full resolution, when you change the mode."

            "I gave this game 3 stars! I love this game so much but... When I updated the game, all my dolls dissapered! I got really sad and angry. I wish I never updated the game. By the way I have some suggestions that you can add into the game: 1: When you update the game, you don't lose all yours dolls. 2: Add more outfits for the girls. 3: For the black eye color it should be darker. I love this game soo much. Thanks for making this game. I REALLY enjoy it!",
            "I love this game. It helps you be creative and choose who you want to create. People without premium get to have a challange were they get to use items that arent premium. I also love this game because it brought me closer to my friends that don't live near me and they end up installing the app. One thing i would like to add would be like hats or bows so you can have things in your hair without paying for premium. I hope this helps everyone that reads this. Thank you for making this game. 😊",
            "5/5 Stars!! I love this game so much! It's a great way to make avatars and you could even make your self and, try out different looks! There is minimal ads but, there could be a spin wheel that you can watch ads to spin and get like a daily spin to earn coins. You could then use those coins to unlock some of the locked items just for 1 or 2 uses. Mainly because some of the best items are locked and only for premium users. Other than that love this game and 10/10 recommend!!",
            "Very fun, adorable avatars, and I love the hairstyles and the fact you can layer the clothes, only one thing, this is just extra kind of feedback, maybe add a few more things, but overall it is amazing! Also it's not even that, that is the only thing I would say about improving this app! Super fun, and the fact you've included masks is another great feature, and shows your respect and seriousness towards the pandemic. Great job!",
            "This is a really great game. I personally think that you could add a new option for creating dolls (full body option) Aswell as this, you could also add some cool postitions for your doll to pose in, this way when you save your dolls they will be in a cool position and you can also see there legs aswell. Other than this, this is one of my favorite games to play. 👍🏻"

        "description": "Children's doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. \r\nWe present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). \r\nIn this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets.\r\n \r\nYou have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful.\r\n \r\nDeveloping games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them.\r\n \r\nOur games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime.\r\n \r\nFor the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time.\r\n \r\nAll you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist\r\n \r\nBe sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:\r\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3A\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudio\r\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames",

They range from insurance, to mattresses all the way to other games. So please, monitor your child! But everything else aside, the game is great. It's repetitive, but kids like that.",
            "I initially thought this app would not benefit my toddler in any way, plus I was a bit bothered overall. The thing is, I wasn't paying attention & pre-judged, I was wrong. As I sat with her & watched her smiling ... I decided to join in & her concentration mixed with true laughter is all I could have asked for ! THANK YOU BY KEEPING IT SILLY FOR HER WHILE STILL PROVIDING AN HONEST LEARNING EXPERIENCE SHE'LL BENEFIT FROM !",

            "It would be more fun if there was more than 3 patients and different things to do but it is a great game also the advertisements every 10 seconds can stop anytime now that's very irritating"

            "I enjoy the ability to listen to a book as I drive, the only to toddler-free time I have. I love the book exchange, so I can keep the books I truly love. It doesn't make sense to me when you can buy an entire audiobook for one credit, but you only get a dollar off the ebook format. I wish that I could get the ebook for a discounted rate, not using my Audible Credit to only get a dollar per credit off.",
            "While having some great content and a very good media player, this app is quite hard to navigate. The search function needs some serious work; the back button and the back arrow don't correlate so sometimes I want to go back a page and I end up loosing my whole search and there is no way to go from your search page to the main navigation menu. Being able to filter by multiple genres would be of great benefit as well.",
            "The subscription is great if you listen to at least one book a year. Just make sure you're using your points on stuff that costs at least $15 and buying cheaper stuff. Once you're out of points you can buy 3 at once which is good if you're trying to get a whole series of books or just listening a lot. If you use it less you can use it without the monthly plan. There are discounts for members though so it's only cheaper without the subscription for people who don't use the app much.",
            "Audible removed the controls that allow you to control the app (play/pause &back 30 sec) from notifications pane. For me this is a MAJOR loss in functionality for the app. Now I have to unlock my phone, go and open the app just to pause or play my audio book or go back 30 sec. I spoke with their tech support about this. They said the feature had been removed and that this was not a bug. BRING THE FRICKING FEATURE BACK!! Audible responded, said it was there under playback settings. NO, it is not.",
            "Functional but bad. The app does what it's supposed to do at a bare minimum; play audiobooks. Sometimes it loses your place and starts you over from the beginning. Sometimes it doesn't sync with playback on other devices. Sometimes it just doesn't even play the audiobook. But for the most part it works. It doesn't respect your screen real estate in horizontal mode, it takes too many unnecessary taps to get to anything meaningful and it is hard to navigate. Recommendations are a total joke. C-"

            "Good but slow on my Galaxy Note 9--specifically when opening, accessing call logs, and opening the search page. Also, no easy way to copy phone numbers to clipboard. It used to identify spam sms texts but seems to no longer. I'm a longtime user on the annual premium plan. Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling every couple weeks to restore my subscription. Solve these things and it's 5 stars.",
            "So far this app has been great, I've been bombarded with spam/fraudulent calls for months interrupting the current phone calls I'm on, my zoom meetings, Microsoft office meetings, ect. The only thing I believe could be a improvement would be, and if it's already a option it isn't explained well on how to use it, is to be able to trace back a spam/unknown phone number to see what the company's name or address is. So I/you know for sure you want to block that phone number.",
            "🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Boy I cannot live without Hiya! There is just one problem though, I wish it gave you more options to do with the call instead of either just send to your voicemail or do nothing. I think it would be great if you could block everyone but the people on your contact list! Like I said Hiya is the best! I will give them a five star rating every time. Thank you Hiya👄",
            "I paid to block calls from area codes and it just isn't doing that. It still rings 6+ times a day from numbers I have blocked and will block numbers I haven't put ìn my block list. 2 stars because it is nice to know where the call is coming from so I can ignore it but minus 3 for not blocking my blocked numbers.",
            "It does the job with stopping unwanted spam and fraud calls. I had a number that kept calling me stating they were social security trying to scam me out of money. They would call from different numbers once I downloaded this app hiya blocked the calls. Now I have some kind of peace. This app is definitely worth the Fee."

The 48megapixel f1.7 camera(on paper) struggles like hell when it comes to artificial light images. The images in artificial lighting looks like it's been shot on a VGA cam. Turning on the flashlight makes the pic even worse. In daylight images, the shots are good with natural blurr effects but the details are clearly missing in closeup shots Even my M g5plus clicks way better pics than this one😪",

It's UI is outdated, colours are muted and overall details just aren't good. It's night mode just lights up the subject rather than improving the photo which results in a grainy image. Please improve it.",

Please optimize saturation colour and ui interface of your camera app also details are missing , auto focus is not proper when recording vedios and taking photos.

            "Ok so this game is 100% on my recommendation list the levels aren't to hard and their quite fun actually! The reason I did 4 stars is the controls after a while the controls get very tedious as the controls don't move the right way to how you need them too, I think it's a bug of some sorts ,if you can fix that I'll up my review to 5 stars thank you for this game :3"

So you literally have to just sit there for about 1 minute everytime you play a song. So you play for like 2 min and watch an ad for 1 min.",

Also please remove some of the ads for better 👍",

And so, I won't get that coins I earned ☹️ Fix this! But still I love this game",
            "Nice game but too many ads, if you fix that I will give you a 5 star rating. The graphics is very nice and it is addicting. And after the new update it super duper awesome. I am also doing videos about it in my YouTube channel. More views are coming.",
            "I love the game because it is amazing to play but I WISH that Becca is included in the game and I hope that her power will be AMAZING I just want to imagine that Becca is included in the game and the Talking Tom Heroes show but I really enjoy playing the game and it was AMAZING it was AWESOME it was GREAT and it was GOOD THANK YOU for the AMAZING game I really LOVE the game.",
            "I loved this great game of you all and the way it worked was great and friends with me that were in a few months ago but we had no clue about what we were looking to make and how to do that game Happy game",
            "I kinda enjoy this game. But I'm just wondering where's the board? You know, the one Ginger rides for loading screen. I just hope we get more power ups that will make the game fast pace. Like boards, if we're riding it we go faster and invincible for a short seconds and we can upgrade it to max the duration. And we can use it, like we have to double tap the screen to activate it. It's just so slow to get to beat our high score. Hope there will be more to this than we already have."

            "Latest Update trashed everything. please fix. Latest update has ruined all downloads. For now everyone AFFECTED by this BUG should go and clear the storage under you apps section. I'm on a Google Pixel 3 Android 11",
            "I am learning to play the guitar and so I need an app like this to help me record backing drum tracks for my practicing. I like the fact that you can see the parts and PLAY THEM and actually listen to the different sounds of the drum set...GREAT. What the app does not offer me, is the chance to place those sounds in a certain order, combine sounds and record the sequence and actually be able to use it as a backing track for your guitar learning. As it is, I see no practical use for it.",
            "I like the overall sound and smooth running of the app. I think it could be much better if you added more features such as being able to move around the pieces to arrange the kit in a way I like, an option to lock the bass drum with a cymbal so every time I hit the cymbal it also hits the bass drum automatically, add a choke to the cymbal, maybe individually adjust each kit piece's volume, and perhaps more options for different sounds (maybe a china, a third crash, a different ride/bell).",
            "I gave it 4 stars because of the delay I'm expiriencing on my tablet. It is fine on my phone and works well but I think it's cause I have an older version on it. I just got my tablet so I'm guessing I have the newest version of it. Please fix the delay and I'll rewrite this with a 5 star rating. The app deserves a 10 star rating when it's working well. It really is a great app. Just that one little🤏 prob. I have faith that it'll bs fixed. Thank you 🙂"

I usually share apps using wifi direct between my samsung phones, and this app has never let me down. Does not affect battery life on none of my phone, which was my primary concern. An app that doesn't consume (much) battery isn't certainly doing any background activity. It's a free app, and a good one too; therefore the least I can do is to write this sort of lengthy review, lol.",
            "This is a very good app. There is a SELECT ALL but it's not obvious, long press any single apk, then tap select all context menu. It's also a little odd that there is no save option only share but that's not too much of a problem since you can share to your a file explorer with the added advantage that you can save to any location that you choose at the time rather than a default folder. Overall a very good app.",
            "I'm always skeptical about these kind of apps because they keep promising things and don't deliver. I tried other apps and no luck but this app worked instantly, I'm actually amazed. I transferred an app to my tablet from my phone via WiFi direct and it worked. Now I'm using the app on my tablet. Thank you app developers for making a genuinely easy app to use and that works what it was intended for. I had to write this to let others know. Thank you once again.",
            "I hate it.when i use this app and the transfer finished the other device need to install it say \"app not installed\" and i try it again \"app not installed \"plss fix it.",

            "i actually used your app since 2016 and i loved everything about it, feauters were great. plus is the best unofficial telegram in my opinion so the reason i'm giving 4 stars is \"we're not able to set profile more than 80!\" And if we do, it will automaticly show only 80 of them, why did you do that seriously? some people really like to set 80+ profile so it really makes me feel sad that you did this. i hope you will make it like before and let us be able to set how many profile we want!",
            "I face lags ,stutters,freezes for a short amount of time when i use low cpu clock speeds. Needs low end device optimisation. Reduce storage & memory footprint. Ease of use can probably be improved. Loading/buffering of videos take exceptionally long time. When playing video sometimes the time is moving but video is actually stuck.Otherwise a great app",
            "First i give 5 star Than after using some times my review changed I am receiving notifications from leaved groups, i can't close that notifications seperatelys also when clicking notifications shows that \" you are not in this group\" Very much irritating with this And also without my consern some fellows adding to their cheap groups😡😡😡😡",
            "Each update is worse than last one, i have always one fake notification in app that not goes away until i force stop the app,why loadimg messages and chats take so much time?",
            "Great app! The best messenger ever! It couldn't be possibly any better except for one little thing. I wish there was a conference call option in the app because I and many others feel a great for that. I and my friends would be extremely thankful if you don't take my little suggestion for granted and present us an update with the new conference call option. Thank you beforehand for such a great work!"

            "I to spent many hours and more money than I wanna admit on this game; only to log in today (10/23/29) to none of my robots. I immediately restored my purchases, and was only given 2 of the 7 robots I bought, not to mention any gold, silver, or any other robots i lost. Needless to say I'm not pleased, and it's come to my understanding that this is a quite frequent issue and it's outrageous that this issue hasn't been resolved yet nor have the means by which they handle it gotten better.",
            "I have owned more than 50 robots including Zeus, Metro Gold, Midas Gold, Zeus Gold along with just 4 -5 Super bots remaining to bought and completed level 49. Most of the robots reached level 4 abilities after fully upgradation. Day before yesterday the game asked for update, after which the total picture changed. Now I am back to step one after updating and have lost all the robots. I am totally disappointed about this game. I want to remove all the stars but a single star remains constant.",
            "It's a great game, brings me back to a younger age too! My only complaints is the ad after each fight, and the loading screen glitch and that come after collecting the milestone rewards. Other then that it's a great game and I highly recommend it!",
            "OK what the hell. I think my phone died during a fight so I'm thinking whatever. I lost one no big deal. But the minute I freaking load up the game again all my progress is lost and I now have ZERO ROBOTS. is it because I didn't spend any money? Unbelievable",
            "I have been playing this game for a while and then downloaded it on my current phone and I am now level 50 with every bot that is fully upgraded, other than a few super bots, Cardinal Chaos, Dark Fiend and Psytron, with 5400 Gold. Can you make them so you dont have to be VIP 7 to get them? But now a few days ago, my account said unauthorized access to the game, but now i am able to play some parts, but if i go into the store and live events it says it, can you please help me fix this?"

            "Okay, so I really like this app. It nees work, but it is better than other choises. At least I can make a password lick for my account so nobody can look through. One problem I had was the color change. I was changing the cover color to blue, and It didn't work although it said it was sugsessful. That was the only bug, It didn't even effect me, so this app is good.",
            "This app is incredible and secure plus if you have a password for your phone than it will be double security. And there is no loosing the lock its in your brain. And you can change the background, the font style and the font color. If you forget your password and you are signed in then they will send you the code. Pretty sweet so i recommend this to anyone who needs a dairy. 😇😍",
            "I like the app, it's really good. The only issue I have is the ad banner that tends to appear most of the way up the screen leaving grey. It's a pain to remove. Also, an idea for you... changing the layout of entried or notes. So you can choose for them to stay as they are, be in reverse order or a calendar layout. 👍",
            "This app is amazing, I love the way it is set up! Its always there to listen even though the stories might be boring, its always there to help you get things off your chest. Without this app I would still have stuff to think about and nowhere to go to talk things through. The only problem is that one time it did not save my progress but it was mainly my fault.",
            "Really good. Recommended. It tells you the date automatically and you can changes colour of text and theme by yourself with no charge. You can even change the colour of the app icon if you don't like pink colours. Many much more feature need to check it out yourself. It's free with ads so don't be afraid to try it out yourself."

            "Great for those idle moments at the various jobs I've worked. It's a fun twist of a platform runner type of game. The different gun sounds are also quite entertaining. Not to mention hearing \"HEADSHOT\" the way the game does it is satisfying. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for something complex, but other than that I enjoy it.",
            "Honestly, I got bored of this after a while so I deleted it, but I hot it back today and it's just how I remember it. It's a pretty fun game. It's simple but fun. Turn in airplane mode if you don't want any ads but you won't get any skins or free guns. Other than that I'm done rating for now. All in all I think this would be a good download for you",
            "Not a bad game. There's quite a few ads, but that's expected from a free game. Gameplay is repetitive but still fun. My issue is with updates. It's been months since there has been an update to story mode, hideout, or gun skins. There hasn't even been new guns or outfits to unlock in the weekly challenge. It's just hammers to unlock, which is pointless when I already have the hideout built completely.",
            "The game is very fun. The ads are reasonably spaced out, about one every 2-3 levels. The gameplay is fun, and you are able to pick how you want to play. The different guns don't have that much of an impact on the difficulty, allowing you to pick your favorite gun, regardless of how much damage it says it does, because everyone except the occasional boss goes down in one hit.",
            "I like the looks of it, but all the movement is automated. The only thing you do is tap the screen when your laser gets on the targets. If I controlled more of the game, I'd like it better. But the concept and art is on point."

            "Good game but in fun there is only gas, nail slider but in food you are only give money or seeing ad I can see ad but only one chance very bad game ever 😒😒😒😒😒 Tom is only talk I am not sure with this game very very very very very very very very bad game 😞😔 so but I have only given two star is the game is more boring I will give it. One star so don't play when first time we play this it is very interesting so don't play this game ok sure thanks 😊👍",

            "It's fun in the beginning, but gets boring pretty quickly. All the courses seem to be randomly generated, but only between the few different obstacles, so everything is repetitive. The different \"courses\" you unlock after winning a select number of races seem to only change the color of the road and nothing else. The speed boost that you can achieve is pretty useless since the other racers (cpu) just get telwportef down the map with you. The bonus jump at the end is nice, though.",
            "Well the game is fun, for some time. Unfortunately it becames repetitive and have some problems. First that when you gain boost you fly really fast but the other \"players\" teleport to you so the boost is useless, then some boost pads on the floor make you go slower for no reason, and then when I was going to rate the game with 3 stars I was redirected to the email so I am giving 2 stars. Overall fun game but gets boring fast.",
            "It's a great game, especially when I'm bored. The only problem is that I've bought all the skins (whatever you call them) for my avatar. I want to have more skins to buy since my virtual coins (that I earned by playing) are over 100k already. It's still very fun though.",
            "In a world of \"play to win money\" and clan style games its nice to have a simple, one goal game and I have never seen a game like this. It has good graphics, good controls and ita simple but addictive.",
            "This game is alright I have a few problems why when I try to turn in a ball thing I fly off the track and why when I use bost pad I go slow pls fix that and when I speed the BOTs teleport to me and it said I had to reset the game DID YOU KNOW I HAD EVERY THING"

            "Would be 5 but developer wanted feedback. Its a recording app. Only way to screw it up is to cram it with ads and push for feedback. Either way. Guess it's nice to get a pat on the back every now and then. And they do deserve it. It's a pretty good app with minimal ad interruption. So if you need to record something download the app. And to the creator. Thanks",
            "Firstly, I don't know why people give this app less than 4stars. Something is really wrong with them . This voice recorder is overall a very good app. The best feature I think it has is the voice editor. It is a blessing for me because my phone's voice recorder is just bollocks.... thats ittt !! So yes...well done.",
            "This is a great app I have enjoyed using. It provides clear recording sound, allows you to mix background sounds with the lead recording, you can trim your recordings add introduce a different voice to your original track. Your can do all these and many on a phone... It's a great thing that I recommend. If there's a PC version please send me the link to download, if there isn't then I suggest the developer should his/her way to get me one. The video recorder from you will be great too. Bravo!",
            "Love the app! Very good at picking up audio (sometimes even too good, but that can be changed in mixing). Would rate 6 stars if it had built-in filters that change the sound. But I get that this is a recording app and I shouldn't expect or even hope for that, so I will still rate 5 stars. Also, make it so the app doesn't fall asleep. I have a fingerprint phone, so it hears the vibration it makes. Again, a spectacular app. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good sound.",
            "Very easy to use. Recording and playback functions are upfront. The ability to share to email and other methods is very easy. Minimal ads and for a free to use product, it was worth it to watch a commercial here and there. Overall, I would recommend this app if you need a simple option to record a message or note or in my case a briefing that I had to do."

Both of these issues are issues that I had with the warioware games as well, so I guess I just don't like this type of game.",

No one has done loaded the game but if you want to don't,because it is so boring. I am sorry for the people who made this game but I HATE IT!!!!!!😡",

Also, and this has happened more than 3 times, it would say I still have to hit a few more cans but there are no cans left to hit. Please fix this. It's very frustrating esp for the harder levels when you're so close to winning.",
            "There are alot of ads running and is very pathetic.. Its like not playing the game but watching the ads.. As i have downloaded it just to watch the ads. Not Worst but it is more then that..",
            "You guys need to fix the bug I'm on level 91 and everytime I get all the cans down the counter still saying that there are still cans left to knock down and there isn't fix it",

A good sparkle effect app. I use it to make 90's edits things, and it's extremely useful to be able to actually choose where the sparkles go, and the size-Unlike literally every other app I've used. I swear, I've been looking for hours for one like this?? In summary, it's good, and I'll actually use this.",

A just small problem is that it doesn't really let you add the glitter in the place you want, but anyways you can fix it by adding it everywhere, and then just erase it where you don't want it! Such a great app.",

            "I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years, and this is the first time I've ever had issues getting onto the game. Lately, the game opens up in portrait mode. Nothing is accessible in portrait. My phone doesn't lock in portrait. I click, rotate my phone to landscape, opens in portrait, and I force close, just to open back in portrait. 9 tries in a row.. all portrait. I've held my phone in portrait mode multiple times this year, and it would always open game in landscape...till now.",
            "I love this game so much. Its so fun and you something to do pretty much everyday. The monsters are so adorable and I love the feeling I get when I summon a monster I have been wanting for awhile. I recommend this game as it has kept me coming back and all the events are so amazing. Summoners has got to be my favorite mobile game out there!",
            "Nostalgia. Played for 2 years since beginning. Coming back after 2016 because of lockdown. So many memories. Would really appreciate if the battle slow-mo animations could be manually turned off. For someone who's working and has limited time to play, it would be a great thing as it will enable one to progress and make it possible for one to spend all arena points, dimensional energy in that time. That's my one and only wish for the game. Edit: Auto farm has made a good game many times better.",
            "I had originally rated this game as 5* however i now feel this to be too high. The game overal is great but certain things let it down: Summon rates too low; Violent Rune procs destroy the game; The recent Street Fighter event was nice however i got every Street Fighter scroll possible from the various events and TOA, they all gave me Wind Chun Li. To say i was frustrated by that was an understatement, surely rng would mean getting at least a different version (water/fire/light/dark) but no.",
            "They don't respect your time, and they respect your wallet WAY too much. You'll grind for hours, days, weeks, months, and make very little progress. The drop rates are the lowest of any gacha I've played, and the game is very much pay to win. Except you can't even guarantee rewards for your money, so if you like to spend on these games prepare to spend a LOT to make up for low rng. If you have problems with spending or gambling in any way, DO NOT get this game."

            "Ridiculously easy. Limited scenarios. Once guns are maxed out, the challenge is gone. It's a little fun up to level 100-150, but then it's just repetitive. Developers need to increase the strength of the dummies to make them more difficult to kill, or more aggressive. Will reconsider playing if developers actually develop a progressive level of difficulty. Not going to be a money maker as I won't pay for the different balls and boosts.",
            "I dont understand it, I delete this game because it starts to seem repetitious (if I spelled that right), and next thing you know Im downloading it all over again. About 8 times now. Got up to level 1000. Devel. team IMO you need more updates like new characters and locations. The one dude in the \"ball machine\" is corny tho\". Just my op. Overall its a good game that has the possibility of being great. You guys are golden.",
            "No BS. Other games claim to be addictive. Literally paid the 5bucks... I just completed Lvl 3500 with no intention of stopping 🤣 its true. This is literally a splatter game with no challenge but headshots are so satisfying. It would be nice if it were a bit beefier at higher levls but so what? Its a phone app. I do my serious gaming on XBox. This is a Time \"Chiller\".",
            "It's one of the most funniest games I've ever seen, I'm level 150 at my first day 😂 The only thing that is not good, is the variety of robots. It only has 3 kinds of robots and I like if it would have more kinds of robots. Please add more 👌",
            "Well I think that this game is fab. I'm now on level 70. I like the upgraded guns. I like how the men get blown away or you blow their heads off 🤣. Different situations. Different guns and different robots. It's just run, easy and I like it."

            "This app is wonderfull!! Would rate it 5 out of 5 stars!!! I love it how you gave a try it for ten mins if you watch and ad so people could see if they wanted to buy the premium pack! But, i found a glitch, I was using the try for free (because my parents wouldn't let me buy it;-;) and i was carving the soap. On the last row, when you finished, the soap would glitch through the knife. My apologies my english isn't good, I'm ten and I'm trying my best 😀",
            "Highly recommended distraction app! My 2 year old boy loves it. And there's plenty of entertainment for adults too. Really well designed, doesn't come across as an afterthought like some of these apps do. I enjoyed it enough to purchased the add-on content, which is good value. It adds some extra games, a few if which are more involved. There is room for improvement: the games could have more settings and added multiplayer focus. That said, the simplicity is its strength!",
            "This game is great and is really useful for whenever I'm stressed! There's just one problem: on game 56, the stovetop cleaning game, when I'm almost done cleaning the entire surface, there's a tiny bit left. The game accepts it as clean, and this is the opposite of calming! Other than this, the game is highly enjoyable. I also have one suggestion: I think you should be able to favorite a few games for easier access, instead of scrolling through them all. All in all, this is a great game!",
            "Amazing. I struggle to relax but this app can usually help me to calm down after a hard day at school. The graphics are of a great quality, and the sound effects really add to the experience. A particular favourite of mine is the clay simulator, which I would like to have more types of. I hope that one of the developers sees this, because I would love them to know what a great app they have made. Thank you so much ♥️.",
            "For those of us who like the challenging and the mundane, these games are either entertaining and crazy obsessive, or relaxing and calm. Great for rainy days, while on lunch break or during time spent in the bathroom. Also perfect for my adult son who has a form of autism and intellectual disabilities. Keeps him busy and focused. Very stimulating, easy and fun. Takes your mind off things when you want it to. Five stars!"

            "I actually love this game so much! It isn't really that complicating, and you can actually see where Miss T is going so that you can stay away from her! The pranks are sometimes easy and hard, but if you play it and play it, you won't be scared of playing anymore! But please in the new update, no more unlocking chapters with money, just after we finish each chapter. OBTW, this is my grandma's account, but I'm using her phone. I'm 11 years old BTW."

            "First one was good, now its just a money making scheme. Hill climb 1 was great, and thats why its so popular. The devs saw how big it was, and decided to make a sequel, purely for the purpose of making money. Its way too hard to earn money, and from the moment you open the game you get bombarded with microtransactions.",
            "Nice thinking!!Great game to pass time Nice cars and vehicles!!!! But There is complain regarding it Please make it easier to look at where we are for example:I want to see that I have reached Bronge2 or not!!But its a bit difficult to see that so please make it easier.The best game if this problem is solved.No such complains regarding this game.",
            "Played the first game and its just about the same, so brilliant. Still playing and still great(14/07/20) Update. Been playing for a year or so now and apart from having to pay a monthly subscription for not much extra (wouldn't advise it) I'm still loving this game. I'd give it more stars if I could 😎😎",
            "I really like this game & even paid 4 the VIP subscription (charged monthly) & I rarely do things like that. Every update made makes this game greater. There's only 1 thing I don't like 2 much & wish would be changed. We don't get 2 race other players in real time..only prerecorded races. 😕 Y? Please change this! That really sucks! It would be so fun 2 race in real time & be able 2 show off ur cars & characters. It's something important that needs 2 change. 3 stars until races r live.. Sorry.",
            "Fun, and surprisingly for a mobile game, the ads aren't intrusive. The vehicles all feel very different and fun. First mobile game I've spent money on since 2014! Small feedback: I wish that we could refund upgrades on the starter cars. assume most people like myself wasted money on cars at the start of the game that they now never use. I don't think it would affect the balance of the late game as I think most people would leave upgrades in the expensive cars that they feel attached to. Otherwise no complaints at all."

            "All say that the game is nice but the ads are to much . U can turn off your net or Wi-Fi . In tab it will not work the idea of turn off the net. From my side this is very nice game . In this game one thing that i don't like is that the sound of the kart during the moving . Except this all the things are vry nice . I enjoy this game while playing. I love this game.",
            "Its a great game, it took me awile to find mostly everything but a really good game, I loved running over rod with the kart",
            "big problem with the ads there's no no ads and you can't purchase no ads so yeah that's my number one problem but my the worst thing of them all is the fact that it's a copy off of granny every the house everything they're like the room is the same as Granny's after the first chapter and then the second one sucks the third one's the only one that actually really good with no where you can actually get no ads and that's probably about the best thing three and I recommend the game."

            "Despite the good premise of the game it has way too many ads. Also one of the things that irritate me the most is that it has an extremely noticeable lack of a replay button I have to quit the level I'm trying to restart it which is frustrating and severely irritating after a while maybe if you can tone down the ads and add a replay button this game won't be so frustrating and annoying to try to play",
            "I've been playing this for a while now and finally bought the ad free version, to support the developers. Despite closing and reopening the app though, it's very much not ad free which means I paid $3 for nothing. Each level still requires ad views and each special box does as well. No clue what my $3 went to, but certainly not what it was advertised as.",
            "First off, it's had so much lag since I installed it, it's ridiculous. I have never played anything in my life with more lag. Secondly, there are so many ads that I feel as if I spend more time watching those than playing the game, EVEN WITH IT TAKING LONGER BECAUSE OF LAG. This app completely isn't worth it. Don't waste your time.",
            "This game is good but the lag and ads are annoying,I certainly hate this and we spend alot watching ads then playing the game,this game have problems,glitches,Etc.I never experience a game that have 1,000 ads in a day more like everyday i'm going to uninstall it.",

            "The old version is the best version of this app. This current model is a huge disappointment and it is consistent of being worst overtime. It focus more on nonsense stuff than the actual objective of this app. Plus, ads are so annoying. If it just stay on what it is designed to be back then, then it would be superb. Not recommended. 👎",
            "This app has been useful and I have been using it for 2 years, I think I have used it for too long that it doesn't work to some users anymore, it doesn't work anymore for me, my brother wanted for me to install Minecraft but he has so we instead tried to share it, it doesn't work, we tried it 12 times already, it kept saying \"receiver not found\" even we are on the same version of this app, it could have been a bug or other stuffs, but pls fix it!",
            "This app used to be great once upon a time. I've been using SHAREit since 2013, but it has just been getting worse over time. Now it's flooded with advertisements and unwanted stuffs. Even the main home page layout has been reduced drastically to make room for more advertisements. But the core feature of the app hasn’t improved at all. Extremely disappointed. Not recommended. There are much better alternatives available.",
            "When I first used this app it was so great and fast and I really love it. But now I higly recommend to stop using it because it has so many adds when you open the app, there are so many permisions requested unlike before and it has many unnecessary things added that should be not added. Every time they update, only the feature is upgraded and they forgot that the use of share it is to transfer fast and this is what the users expect, they should not put some unnecesary things.",
            "Now I really have to give it three stars. The ads are annoying me. The send and receive bottons are small. If I receive any app or game from another Mobile it doesn't install says base. And every time you give the same update. So can do something so it becomes popular like before. Please do something or I have to this app give it one star and install another app. I really love this sharing app. I am using it 2 years. But now I think this app has become an online video showing app. Thank you."

            "The actual game is entertaining and fun. There is a lot more to it than I thought. The main problem I had was the lack of notch support. I am running the game on my Pixel 3XL and some of the screen is cut off. It doesn't hinder the gameplay specifically but it's hard or impossible to see the achievements that pop up for nitro boost. Overall the gameplay is fun, and I've enjoyed it.",
            "I gave this app 5 star, perhaps for the improvement to the game in betterments of graphics, more sports bikes and motoGP racing characters, make bikes' meter console little realistic. Characters needs to lean more in high speed so that it will looks so much better like a real life. Top speed and the breaks are amazing but the handling needs to improve. I think vehicles are too much on the highway. For me Maps are really good, if include isle of Man tt map this will be the best moto racing game❤️",

            "Ok, I don't know what the developers did but they got it right ! The best thing about the game is it's competabilty with my phone. The craftsmanship is easy on my processor & Ram so the game does not Freez or crash during play !!! The game is awesome with a realistic and mature feel to it ( there's no colorful guns or ridiculous costumes ). The graphics are great and the controls are easy to get used to. This is a Nice 1 try it out !",
            "Game is easy and good also but there is one problem too many ads and please give some options for playing a squad online. One more thing the pictures are 100 percent fake.",
            "game controls and graphics, weapons, everything is great. only problem is too many ads. though we can even buy ad free version. but if compared to other games its really way too much good in everything except ads😀. congrats to team and pls try to add 'playing local via wifi'",
            "I like it its Fun please can you add more guns like shotgun and more and the character can you please add character that have a skill that all i can say ITS REALLY GOOD",
            "One of my best game I will 4 stars for graphics and for maps But you miss one star because there should be new maps and made it multiplayer so that we can play with our friends and enjoy the game to fullest. Should introduce double jump feature and should also introduce more boosters like jet jump and super shoes for temporary flying i am also a game developer so i think can give these kind of advice all of above game is quite amazing."

            "This game is addictive! Since I have only five lives I can't get bored of it, and I love the new challenges they continue to add to the game as I get further and further, there are however flaws as well, there aren't many things to buy with your money, so now I have tons of money but nothing to buy with it except powerups which I rarely use. Another flaw is the ads, they are SO FREQUENT! I think the game could use more customization options for your trail and character color, good game though!",
            "Ads, ads, ads. Ya don't want 'em? Too bad. If i'm reviewing the concept? This is a fantastic game, somewhat a mix of escape games and pinball. The little sprite is cute, and the graphics are simplistic, but very well-made. If I'm reviewing the gameplay? (For summary, see title.) This is an awful game. Lurking behind these \"honest\" ads is a whole mess.",
            "One of the best games in my life this game is very amazing I never had anything like it I played it when I was three to four me and my little sister we do challenges pretending that we are grown up and we have children and then if we lose we die and then we staying to the game forever we play this game a lot in her basement I hope people like this game and I hope this game is rated 5 stars I love you Tomb of mask🥳💗",
            "Change is good because it's like a board game but it's very fun and it's very funny you get lots of coins and stuff and I'm already on a level 69000 I'm very good and I just stopped playing 5 seconds ago is very good",
            "There is literally no ads at all and the game is good. There's a bug that you sometimes get stuck in arcade mode to where you can't even move. But, alas, the game is still pretty good. 1 out of 10 I'd say the game is an 8."

            "It's so much fun, and has plenty of goals to achieve. There are cool levels and unlockables and multiple characters to unlock. The game sure does reward you and even makes use of the animals you save with a cool little build feature, which isn't much, but still another extra that it's better to have than to not have. GREAT GAME!!!",
            "This is a cool running game, ill have to admit. So many equips, awesome animals to collect and more wonders to find. Ever since I was 4 I was afraid of loneliness. Sonic was my idol so helped me find confidence in myself. Now that I can play as Sonic my childhood dreams have been fulfilled. I am now 17 years old. I still remember sonic as my freind. I am crying right now remembering the happiness I used to feel. I have Coronavirus and still in hospital. I still remember the soft touch of Sonic.",
            "The game is still one of, if not THE best on the app store. But I wish we'd get the Sonic Adventure 2 (Dreamcast and Gamecube) costumes instead of the ones we're getting now (especially since we didn't get to use them outside of the multiplayer). I mean vampire Shadow is nice, I guess, but that's a joke that writes itself. Skelton Shadow however, is a much better and less \"busy\" design. Sometimes, less is more.",
            "Simple, addictive time-killer. It's not the most elaborate or polished game, but it does its job well-enough for an on-rails racer with Sonic characters. It's very ad-heavy, which is understandable to a certain extend, but it does tend to stop the game dead in its tracks after each level/retry. Not a huge fan of that, the wait is reason I stop playing each session.",
            "BEST GAME EVA! I had the best experience playing this game, and I'm not just saying this because I love Sonic the hedgehog! I love the feature where you can unlock characters without paying for them, it really helps those who can't afford it (or those who's parents don't allow it) Any, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SEGA! Also i know that it's gonna be Amy's birthday soon (October 6) so..HAPPY BIRTHDAY AMES!"

            "Nothing really works, unless it's a function that entails you giving them money. Never an issue, there! But, the biggest turn off for me is the PvP arena. There's no matching players with other players of their same, basic, level. There's always one or two \"players\" that have 50000+ Defensive and 15000+ Damage. Which leads us back to the spending money bit... The only way to get to those levels of Defense and Damage is by purchasing temporary enhancements. With \"diamonds.\" AKA real money.",
            "Super fun & amazing graphics for using just a phone, never could have imagined this a decade ago that I'd be able to play a video game on my phone with better graphics than my old video game console!! I just wish 1 thing, that I would be able to get upgrades on rifles & packages without having to spend money! It takes a lot of time & missions in order to get enough coins/diamonds to get the really good weapons or even to make upgrades to your own weapon.... Please help me out with something!!",
            "Graphics are excellent Gameplay is excellent I would give it five stars except for. 1) you have to watch too many videos to get diamonds 2) they basically want you to spend your money to upgrade your equipment 3) you fill up the piggy bank with your skill and they force you to buy it so you can get the diamonds that you earned 4) most of the equipment in the game is unattainable unless you purchase it.",
            "Edit: End edit. Addictive, but fun! Can't play too long without paying and especially long when you factor in the expensive guns and upgrades you need. Sure, you can play free but it's rather boring that way....sigh. Now, when actually playing, it is pretty cool. It's fun and the controls are actually intuitive and responsive. Overall, the game is setup rather well.",
            "one week in I have found this game to be very unstable. The developers help section claims the network issues are related to wifi, providers and connectivity to there servers. While in the game app purchases work no problem, when you click on free items offered, (please check you network connectivity) I have done various real time tests and found all of my large data apps don't confirm there claims. I would be warry of committing to a subscription until the developers fix connectivity issues."

            "It's and ok game, I just wish there were more mini games and the different areas for animals should be such high levels to get. Also, there's this weird glitch thing where around the butterflies in the beach and around the ground and the pufferfish in the bubble game have a weird outline, like a square outline. Also, there should be more animals and they should be easier to get.",
            "This game is so good but when I installed the game for first time there are only 115 animals to collect but now it's to difficult to collect 126 animals , and also there are more islands like there is beach a waterfall and lava land but there would be one more island like the hank island where hank angela tom Ben and ginger ,so this is the problem in this game ."

            "There are times when the game wants you to watch an ad to get a skin but won't let you do it. Then when I die I have to whatch an ad to play again. Most of the skins are bad but the only good ones are the impossible ad ones. And some of the obstacles kill you even if you duck or dodge it. Worst of all, I hit in the green zone on an epic level and got killed somehow.",
            "Very poor game not satisfied plus has too many ads a irritating game.I was just playing level 24 it started flickering and I don't understand what is the need of epic level . Epic level is just like this just for coins.Coins we can collect while winning. I am angry due to so many ads after each level ad. For opening chest room ad. For new skin ad , means this game is filled with ads and I don't like the games which have ads.I am not satisfied with the game and. I wanted to give zero stars to it.",
            "Experience on this game is amazing you can get so much out there you can get new Skins and it can sort teach you how to be more skilled to but the game is quite buggy the game is kind of different it's not a normal game and I would not recommend this game well I would but but if you ever played this game I'm sure you feel same way but all you need to do right now is just download the app",
            "If ads pop up, just turn of your WI-FI or Mobile Data, that way you won't get any ads at all. That will make the game less laggy too! I love this game, it's interesting, and quite funny too. I rate it 5 stars.",
            "I rate this Five because this is cool for me i don't mind it the ads. The ads it's little, i like this game i love so much i think i'm up too 100 but it's fine this game i like it."

Seems like it must intentionally be a scam, because otherwise there's absolutely no excuse for Google not making it a crystal clear and perfect transition for previously PURCHASED music.",
            "Awful! The quality of sound is subpar. Not to mention the app allows songs/videos recorded by mobile phones, & mind you I have to use this app now bc Google is dropping Google Play Music, & I am actively paying for a Music Subscription. And Google deems this recording adequate on their paid subscription! Absolutely an abysmal platform. The Google Play Music selections & radio algorithms were amazing, rarely disappointed. I am so glad I never invested in the family plan.",
            "Worst app ever. Way to take a step backwards. I want a refund for all my purchased songs through google play! I dont even want to open the app. My purchased songs and music I have off of CDs are separated and cant listen to them together. I used to beable to hook my phone up to my speaker at work, hit play and have a good day, now I have songs repair g themselves on a shuffle. Why even take away google play? All these jack asses is suits whith their heads shoved so far up their asses. REFUND ME!",
            "Horrid, coming from Google play music, it's a HUGE downgrade. Wise people say if it's not broken, please don't try fix it. Unfortunately YT music only proves how true that saying is. Twice as buggy, one fifth as intuitive with an order of magnitude the complexity. Along with the most amateurish design I have seen in a long long time. Compared to the clean lines and simple design on Google play music, this is a massive slap in the face! I simply won't stand for it.",
            "If you force someone to use an app because a different one is no longer active, you have to make sure the app works properly! It takes forever for my device music to load, and when it finally does, it takes forever to play a song (that's saved to the device mind you). And this wait time occurs after EVERY song. This is unacceptable. I didn't ask to integrate Youtube with my personal music library, but make sure the app works properly if you're going to force someone to use it."

            "Ugh! Why do you guys always insist on \"improving\" EVERYTHING? What's wrong with just leaving a great game alone? I used to LOVE this puzzle game and had given it 5 stars but then you went and tried to \"improve\" on an already perfect app. Now there's constant lagging, you took away the ability to set pieces on the game board under the puzzle, you took away the \"move in\" \"move out\" option as well as other options. Please let us go back to how it was before. It was just fine as it was.",
            "At the moment I only play with 64 pieces, but I am over 80 and get a thrill on completion. I get through several a day. Since the update, it has become rubbish. After it stops working, which is often, it no longer returns you to the puzzle at the point at which you left off, it takes you back to the beginning - so frustrating. For me, it is ruined.",
            "Since you updated the Ap. It's been awful. Used to be able to see everything on one page, now it's only six. Got so p.off I uninstalled, and then reinstalled, now it's not only huge pieces but can't find 'edges' button to start the game properly . I also lost all the games I had completed. when will I go into my puzzles see only the one for today! NOT HAPPY JAN! Will look elsewhere, got to be something better out there.",
            "USE to love this game, since last update it sucks!Having the past months totally opened takes up too much room!The way it was before where we had to tap on the month to open it was better! The square to put pieces on keeps jumping around when I try to adjust size to lock. The pieces won't lock on the square without multiple times moving pieces & finally it will stick. Don't know why you needed to update EVERYTHING please put things back how they were! If it aint broke dont fix it!I miss my fun!",
            "Not sure what has happened with the last update. The pieces are more difficult to stick on the board now. I have to move the piece several times across the same spot on the board before it locks in place. It's so annoying. Also the board moves around too much to play without locking it in place. Please put it back the way it was and I'll glad Restore the 5 star rating!"

            "I rlly enjoy it but EVERYTHING is ads . I think I spent more time watching ads than play games . Also , alot of things cost money and would not recommend for a little fry . But in all the consept of the game is child friendly but not whith 2 yr olds. Dose anyone else think its wired that you can be a HUMAN!? And no I can't hold my breath for more than 15 seconds thank you very much. I just realized this got random. Well have an awesome day! 'Put a bannana in your ear ' - Jason Steel",
            "The game is very nice to play and good for passing time ,but there is one big problem. The problem is that there are much adds.Only 2 adds of thrill rush and uphil rush are repeated before a level. I am bored because of the adds. Please fix this problem as much faster as you can.",
            "This is very nice game😇 but the reason I gave it 4 stars is This 👀, sometimes it stop working in easy words you can say it become hang😔😔and it takes very much time to start😴 or you can say it takes much time for downloading 😕other wise this is good game 😍you must also download this game😋 it doesn't let the people's bored😏 this is the best game for fun😝 ,enjoyment😜 , happiness😛 and for free time too 😃",
            "This game is sooo cute I won many rounds in the dolphin show and played it all day when I was a kid. This is a dream come true to customize a dolphin of mine and it's a fun game to play for the whole family. I would rather download it now rather than in 2013."

They've dumbed it down to the point where I can no longer use the new version and I will have to go to one of the mirror sites and load an old version. It's the only part of Facebook I use and they managed to muck it up.",

I have also reached my limit in as far as any updates saying, \" Update info not provided by developer\". Last update has 2 many problems. After last update, my posts pass fast as if a speil game! When will fb ever learn? If there is no definition for the app. I will not upload it. I have to go to my frigging insights to do an edit on my spiritual angel page! One star is 2 much 2 give.",
            "Please add a message attachments, just like what's App has.... ,and also there is problem when I try to share link, the full link doesn't get generated and when we try to delete the message, it should be delete from both the sides, the sender and receiver side... Please, please, please..... It's a humble request...",
            "Messenger Lite is a good app but it could use a bit more improvements and features. One is that it should have a dark mode option, everyone is wanting it for months now so please do it. Also add the reply function and the option to unsend messages. Lastly, sending a file is such a good feature of the app that also should be added to the main app, but please improve it by retaining the actual file name of the files we send instead of changing it to randomly generated name and numbers. Thank you.",
            "Since the new update It is not working. I have new messages showing, but when I click on the persons name it never loads the message. No messages are showing up. I Am beyond frustrated. Before, I never had a problem viewing my messages and sending them."

Now a game with 5 or 10 second ads will get played and you will subject the player to a lot more ad time. How can you be smart enough to write a game but not be able to figure that out? Uninstalled.",
            "MORE ADS, LESS PLAY This is a pretty fun game but it's sadly riddles with ads. If you skip an ad for a reward, you're met with an ad anyways. That's cheap. Don't be cheap. I would love to see your company implement higher ethical standards when it comes to things like how often you subject your potential buying customers with ads. Right now it's about 10 seconds of game play VS. 120 seconds of ads. If you treat ppl better, they're more inclined to micro pay",
            "Pretty entertaining. However, the ads are excessive and what really irritated me was the coin math wasn't correct. If you watched an ad for a certain amount of coins, you did not receive that amount of coins. It was way less, sometimes a few thousand less. Something that basic shouldn't be wrong in a game. Very irritating.",
            "I wish I could give this a 3.5. Sounds are great, game play is fun, coins are useful and there's always a fun little \"3x coins! Watch this ad!\" Ads aren't a huge issue since you can turn your wifi and data off. I believe more detail on uniqueness should've been done, and more add-ons like bombs, or something that you get further on other than skins that makes the game continually fun. All in all, game is a fun time waster :)",
            "I like the game, pretty nice here, you get more people, fight other armies and bosses. And that is it. But the reason I gave 3 stars, Because 2 reasons. 1: The ads here are terrible. You just keep getting ads everytime you complete a level. 2: There is this weird bug where when I go to next level, this black screen kinda looking things keeps appearing and disappearing on my screen, and whenever that happens, it ruins my advantage of winning.

This gets a star for effort and credit because this game is awesome! :)",

Thanks for making this great game! I have never played it before, so I have rated it with 3 starts. If the problem f",
            "I loved this game very much😍😍😍. I played this game many times in Practice Mode until I mastered this. But there is a glitch that you should fix. When Granny reached the stair in the 2nd Floor and I left the door open, I hide under the bed, she is only at the end of the stairs, and WHAM!!! Instant jumpscare. Please fix it and all of the rest of the glitches. Thank you😘😘😘.",

(For some reason) Thank you for making this game! And the easier way to play the game with an enemy is with Grandpa. Thank you the developers for making this game!",
            "This game is like ossom. I think that the first chapter of this game is a little bit hard for me .It seems that the house was small but there were too much of secret doors .But in this we can easily explore the house 🏠 in the practice mode.GRANDPA has added a lot of attraction in this game.

            "It's a dorky 2 d game. But I love it. I play it with my kids. Also toooooooo many ads! I am annoyed to have to watch ads to earn coins to buy upgrades. There should be a way to earn enough through the game. What if I pay$ 3.99 for no ads? How will I earn coins and extra power in the tournaments? I hope the developers of this game get stomach cancer. You think that's harsh? Try literally wasting hours of your life watching all these ads.",
            "Game is great. I have no problem at all with the actual game, HOWEVER, the thing that brought this game down from what could have been a four or five star, was the ads. The moment you open the game, there is no way you won't see an ad. Win a battle? Watch an ad. Loose a battle? Watch an ad. And yes I get that you can spend money to remove ads but a lot of players are freebees, and that really narrows down where you are getting revinue from. Please do something about the ads.",
            "I like the game, but the ads make it unplayable. An ad after every two shots, often before and after every game, and randomly in the main page. Plus you have to watch an ad to actually receive any rewards from playing. I decided to purchase the overpriced ad removal to be able to actually enjoy the game. DO NOT DO THAT!! It does not actually remove all of the ads. You still have to watch an add after every single round just to receive any rewards. This game is not pay to win, its watch to win.",
            "the game is a lot of fun although there is a warning right now there is a lot of ads on this game I would recommend playing with the signal off for such as Wi-Fiso if you don't want to get rid of the fads do not play with Wi-Fi on although it is still a very fun gametank stars is the best game I've ever played that is why I rated 5-stars I would rate it 10 Stars if there was a such thing",
            "When I first played the game I was super happy! I loved the theme and the easy controls! I am not giving it 5 or 4 stars, though. First, sometimes when I got out of the game and then came back the game wouldn't work, and that's not all. The only way to play again correctly was to UNISTALL the game! WHAT THE HECK?! I lost all my progress more than THREE TIMES! Second, because I am not done, there are WAY TO MANY ADS! Every 1 to 2 minutes an ad appears! If it had less ads..."

            "Fun game but ridiculous amount of adds. I refuse to pay for the no add option based off reviews. Looks like it doesn't matter if you pay or not. Is it really necessary to have to sit through adds to do anything? And I mean anything. Even if I win a level still have to watch one to move on. I spend more time watching adds than playing the game, I'm seriously thinking about deleting this app because of this!!!",
            "Started out fine. But like other reviews have said, recent changes eliminated the consecutive games bonus ball chances. Sometimes watching the ads gets you nothing so the bonus are even more useless. I'm stuck on a level, I'm out of all my props, and no matter how many ads I watch I can't seem to have enough bonuses or luck to move passed the level. I guess I'm done playing this game (that I did buy the ad free version of in the first place)",
            "I love this game but I'm deleting it today, I had an internet outage and I played this game it ran up 10$ worth of cell data usage in one day I assume from loading the same fours adds over and over and over and over, well you get the picture, I didn't and I learned I have never bought something from one of there adds, and now I won't have to see another ad from them again, but it's a really fun game.",
            "The game is fun as an arcade game. Play a level and then get back to whatever work you were doing. What annoys me the most is that everytime you open the app it takes 5 seconds to show you a pop-up of the diamond membership. WHICH I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNING UP FOR. I cannot recall the number of times I was about to select a level and accidentally selected one of the options for membership ALMOST making an in-app purchase without my consent. I don't mind the ads. But this is just frustrating.",
            "It IS a pretty good game. But I watch enough ads to earn you money without them being shoved down my throat for just loading the damn game! Every greed driven game gets a 1 star rating from me. Want me to change it? Stop being greedy and understand it is just a game. You can't eat it wear it or live in it, therefore it is NOT worth what you are demanding for it!"

Honestly its annoying, shouldn't once be enough already? now i can't even get into my account cause they're asking for my phone number, and it says that its unsupported, which doesn't make sense cause thats what i've been using 4 making accs..",

It doesn't go back to the tweet I was looking at. Can you please fix it everything was working fine before :)",

It seems like these kind of games are always slow and buggy and glitchy and it makes my 1 year old phone seem like it's 10 years old. And 2 for some odd reason, right in the middle of the game, it will get laggier and laggier until it all of a sudden freezes and then closes the app like nothing happened.",
            "This game is pretty good for a momentum based game, unfortunately the business practices of the company that made it are pretty wack. My primary issue is that when you fail you are given the option to revive yourself for watching an ad, pretty standard stuff. However, even when you choose not to watch an ad, 9 times out of 10 you'll still be given one! Frankly, it's annoying and makes me not want to even bother playing.",
            "This game has so much potential but falls short of creativity. Once you unlock all the balls and dunes there's literally nothing else to do but jump dunes. I'm not trying to over complicate a simple game but having some mini games, more challenges or maybe even battle mode (competing with 4 others to see who can go further or higher) would be awesome! I would even pay for that",
            "I would hace had fun but no. They have to fill it with ads. The only reason i get mad when i die is not because i died. But because i will have to sit through an ad. The game would be fun but nah. Inside the creators minds is all like \"hah u thought the game was supposed to be good? You must be insane! Its just to stuff our wallets with money u dumbo!\"",
            "I feel like the hate this game is getting is a tad undeserved. It's a really good and fun game. Even though it's pretty simple, it never gets old! The ads though. That's probably the reason so many people dislike this game. Other than that it is an amazing and addictive game. Just tone down on the ads, and it's an easy 5 star!"

In some songs, it also has synchronization lyrics that match up with the song that playing. You can also search for song title that always in your mind by singing to it. Even if you forget the lyrics, it can do the seach by your humming. Unfortunately, it doesn't have many Indonesian song references.",
            "Was much better in the past. Could not find \"Waiting for love\". After some time I remembered the name (obviously) and checked, if I did the melody wrong. Tried various parts with different styles of humming/singing, but no use. I remember this being a straightforward app in the past that could even find some more exotic anime songs. Also, the UX got worse. Why did I paid money on that app, when it's showing me big nasty ads during my search? Please find your way back to your roots!",
            "Great app, I use it on a regular basis to identify songs when streaming. October 2020, I just needed customer support to make a change to my account, they were incredibly helpful, efficient and quick. I can't say enough to good about the support, thanks.",
            "Great app, able to recognize songs even from a far distance. but i wish it had some sort of a \"running in bachground\" button or sth like that so that the user was able to recognise music being played on his/her own cell phone, the sad thing is that the app isonly usefull for external music recognition and there is no way for it to work in the background when you jump from it into another app such as instagram",
            "I love Soundhound. No more pulling my car over quickly to find pen & pencil to write partial lyrics down or artist. I even called the radio stations if I didn't have a clue so they could tell me what just played. There's been upgrades to cell phones that I could now record etc. But Soundhound is safer for me driving I make sure it's on the screen on my phone as I leave. I wish it could be installed on my Amazon Tablet but they dont allow it or my HP Computer where Google Play store wont allow."

            "Ever since I upgraded recently to my S20, Spotify just doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to open and close the app several times to get it to work, and half the time it just hangs on a black screen and never opens, the other half it makes it to a playlist but never starts playing. Restarting my phone fixes it for a little while, but having to restart every time just to get Spotify to work?? Ugh. This isn't what I'm paying for Premium for!!",
            "The ads are getting ridiculous. I don't mind ads every 6-7 songs. It's a tolerable necessity. Once and a while it'll start playing ads after ever second song, though. Usually I have checked and updated the app and it goes back to normal, except this time. Now I get an ad ever other or after every second song. This is just stupid. I am not going to subscribe to a paid version if you folks can't even manage the free one. Not to mention, you should be getting enough $ from the ads, anyway. Fix it!",
            "Spotify has been one of my most used Apps and well worth the price of my premium price I pay. But lately it's been glitchy as hell, especially when listening to podcasts. The podcast will randomly stop playing in the middle of the episode, and more often than not, the \"Now Playing\" screen is out of sync with what I'm currently listening to. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but to know avail. Super frustrating.",
            "This should be my favorite app. I use it every day, throughout the day, and it lets me listen to a wide variety of music. But it's so ridiculously laggy, especially the first time I open it in a day. Just now it took 20 minutes to actually open up, after crashing twice and making my entire phone so laggy I couldn't use it. I pay money for this, stop telling people to uninstall and reinstall it and FIX IT.",
            "Pretty solid music app. Audio quality is good if you pay for premium, and decent if you don't. One major problem is that the app ends up needlessly taking up 1GB or more within about a month, maybe less. Fix this and I'll fix my review. Edit: they fixed that issue, but now there's an issue where the music stops randomly. Arguably worse."

            "Similar feedback to most of the other users. Since the update the ads are much more frequent and really interfere with the enjoyment of playing the game. I have actively sourced another suduko game that has virtually no ads whatsoever. Thanks for your reply, However, my account WAS AD FREE, until I was advised I needed to update. I updated, NOW I am back to receiving ads. Also skip ad symbol takes around 30 secs to appear in the top left corner. Maybe you would be kind enough to remove the ads",
            "Great game but a big memory hog and it has to stay on device, there is no option to move it to SD Card. Also, more time spent watching Ads than playing time. I play from the UK and the Non-representational Ads shown are banned by UK Trading Standards. It's on its way off my device ... UNINSTALLED.",

The version in paris where You can send angela Letters And sing with Angela. can we have that back? i Really. really! Like the first version way better than this. Its A Not Kind of fun game now The Update Ate whole of the game. I Promise you If You Change It. it will get more Rates. Its Not only for me Fun, But You to change your new boring game to the old",
            "I WANT THE OLD VERSION! It was so nice . Tom would sing with Angela ,chat with her,ginger would throw a flower pot on Tom's head,there would be an earthquake, a strong gust of wind,the would sing together, Tom would give gifts to Angela.I was awesome!but this version is just boring",
            "Listen here dude the old version \"Tom loves Angela\" was way better. This version is boring and you can see them kiss, hug, dance which is gross. I want to the version when Angela is on the balcony and Tom on the roof, and you could write letters 📝 to Angels and she would answer, also you would sing a song called \"you get me\". Do not install this game. Not good game dev. I have no idea how this game has so many 5 stars.",
            "It's a good game, But I want to add some more features in this games like Tom and Angela live with each other. They go out and we have to dress up them. We have to make food for them, decorate there house and many more. And I also want some action scenes that some thieves took Angela with them and we Tom will go on a mission to rescue her. Please add these features. 🙂",
            "We want the old version So the old version was amazing, And so fun. They could sing songs and chat (I would troll her) She was on a balcony and Tom was on a roof, there could be a earthquake and Ginger could throw a flower pot on Tom's head. Tom could give her gifts and stuff, And there was really fun games as well. This Version This version is really boring. All they can do is Kiss, Hug, dance and read cards. That's literally it. It's super boring, If I could I would give it no star."

            "This game is full of potential, though it has some issues, some big some small. Here they are: 1.too many ads. This is the worst problem with the game by far. Yes, they are personalised, but there are too many of them, ranging around 1 per 20-30 seconds and at the end of killing buddy. 2. Glitches. Sometimes there is a possibility that you cannot load into the game and it stays at a certain amount for a long time if not, permanently. 3.Slow Progression. 4.Gets boring over time(1hr). 5/10",
            "Fun to play but way too many ads, even after you buy the \"remove ads\" package. And the VIP package is way too expensive. I could see spending that or even a little more for a month renewal, not a week. Other than that it's a sadistic little time killer. Cool concept. Edit-stars have dropped, broke down and paid for the diamond membership, which would be good, except now I can't watch any videos at al. So the items you can get by watching videos and the free gold you can get won't work at all.",
            "Ads ads ads ads ADS!!! What's with all the ads?! I can't even use one weapon without watching an ad! Even the ads won't let me get back to the game so I have to reopen the game! And when i do watch ads to get free stuff,it says to wait a whole 9 hours!!! But the continuos ads says other wise. Fix the ads already,maybe your game would be 5 stars if it wasn't for all the annoying ads.",
            "Can I give it 0 stars? So many ads. You can't play for more than a minute without getting an ad. And then it is nearly impossible to hit the x to close the ad, unlike other games. And they ask you to rate the game before you even get a chance to play and see all the ads. Uninstall.",
            "This game is suppose to be called \"Watch the Ad\". If you want to go to the weapons menu, ad. Don't wanna watch an ad for a prize? Still an ad. This game would be decent but you had to put ads every time I switch my weapon or kill him. I played this game like 2 years ago and this is why I deleted this and never Re-installed this game till now to see a disappointment. I don't reccomend this game to ANYONE at all."

            "Its a good app, but lately i have been getting spam notification from russian email account. These notifications come to mobile with a document containing a link. sometimes i accidentally click on them. I had to install an antivirus and also resort to better security for all devices in the network because of this. I also see this issue been reported to you guys, please advice on how to be safe on this matter.",
            "Can't upload any file. Tried using mobile data as well as wifi. It shows preparing to upload and an animated icon. Nothing got uploaded. I am facing no issues when using laptop to upload the same file... I tried resetting app data and cache, still no change. I recommend checking your app first and then respond. Same issues were happening with my brother's phone and the files were uploaded after an hour. Unlike him I am not having the time nor patience. I have high speed broadbanconnection.",
            "Total mess. 1. When uploading things to the drive, I used to get a black arrow pointing upwards in my notifications to indicate that the upload was complete. Now, I have to manually go in and check to see if the upload has been completed. 2. Many uploads, for reasons which can only be down to the app, are not uploading completely and failing. The thing is you never know until after think you have saved space in your phone and deleted the item.",
            "Upload from phone won't work. So hit and miss most of the time and often can't upload. Very frustrating. Edit: responding to Google LLC, I am using the app. On my phone. And I have tried incognito and the browser. Also how is a different network a solution? What am I supposed to do? Change my mobile service provider in order to use this app? I've paid for extra storage and honestly think this is a terrible app. I'd give it no stars at this point I'm so frustrated with it . :(",
            "This app is so disappointing..... immediately I installed it, I tried uploading a file on there...it just didn't work, I tried multiple times but still nothing. It was like a complete waste of my time and WiFi. I still haven't been able to make use of it. So I'll definitely uninstall it soon because it's simply..only clugging my phone memory."
