            "Versatile and helpful, this app packs almost all the features that I need, plus several unfamiliar exercises which, nonetheless, are easy to do and quite effective. I am guilty of leaving it unused on my phone for a while, but now that I have started using it daily (max efficiency, 500XP mode), I feel like there's some improvement already in a week or so.",
            "To the developers, Nice app. Really helpful. Just a few things I'd like you to look into: 1. There is no pause button during workouts. And if BACK, HOME or lock by mistake, and then return, the 1 min timer gets restarted. Some workouts don't work properly altogether after this problem. 2. To activate any plan, we need to click on the SETTING button. However, the SETTING button of the DRY EYE PLAN is not working properly.",
            "Love the exercises. Unfortunately the Learn part doesnt seem to work properly. Visual acuity gets stuck displaying an object or letter (no questions or feedback) , Eye quiz and Accomodation say to swipe for next question but nothing happens when I do that. Kaleidoscope feature works. I remember these features working. I have a huawei p20 lite with android 9",
            "I wish the exercises reflected realistic daily routines. I wake at 5am normally, and 10a-3p is more late morning/afternoon. Broaden the time restrictions on the compiled exercises, please. I would be inclined to use the app way more.",
            "the exercises are nice and well put together. However, I can't judge their effectivness as the app \"reminders\" don't work, so I often forget to do the exercises on time. If it gets fixed, not only will I give it 5 stars, but will look into buying some of the plans."

Breaks reminder with eye exercises based on medical recommendations will help you to avoid eye-strain and keep your eyes in healthy condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best health and wellness app, very effective for complex eye health care and protection. Shows notification bar when different eye protection modes are activated. It is not intrusive, very easy to turn on/off or snooze the protection for couple of hours. Optimized to use very little of your phone battery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proven that cold blue light is dangerous for eyes and may even be a root cause of cataract or retina damage after couple of years.

Normally my vision is always blurred. While going into the shops, buying face masks, returning to my car, I had clear vision. Normally faces are blurred. Not this time. I could even see faces in cars, except those with dark tinted windowscreens. I couldn't see the 3D image in the app. Maybe one day I will.",
            "I only review a few apps But this one was worth it. I just wish that it would a few other advices about eye health,that would improve awareness of what we do, but I can't take away the great idea, job and the small size of the app.it is great job by the developer of the app.",
            "Used it for the first time tonight and i never realised how tight the muscles around my eye were. It felt like the muscles were being stretched, especially with the eye circles. Instant relief for a software testers eyes, great stuff",
            "My eyes does feel less tired after the exercises! Great apps!",
            "Pros: I could feel my (left) eye discharging tension as I did the exercises. I didn't realize how much stress my left eye had been holding. Definitely a very helpful app. Cons: I would like to see a note at the end of the exercise encouraging the continuation of the exercises by expanding the range of motion. I. E., repeat the exercises using the corners of a book or room, and not just the corners of the phone."

So if your left eye is better, you can remember the sequence first, then use you memory to see better same characters for right eye. Also it gives very different scores for different test. Overall considering so many design flows I do not recommend using this app at all.",

            "Fairly accurate except the test to see if your glasses are right for you. It said my glasses were not right for me. I tried the regular test with glasses on and had 100% vision in both eyes which tell me me my glasses are the right strength. Also the test to see if you have a stigmatism isn't right. It said I have a stigmatism in both eyes and my Son got the same result when he has 20/10 vision which is even better than 20/20 vision!"

        "description": "The huge amount of information, that we consume every day, makes our eyes to strain all the time, so you start to feel eye fatigue. The root cause of many eye problems is overexertion. Even if you have normal vision, your eyes should rest. Otherwise after intensive work you might have such symptoms as dry or red eyes, and lack of foresight. And if your vision is far from perfect, eye relaxation is a must do!\r\n\r\nEye exercises and trainings from this app (including yoga, patter stimulation, stereo images along with  Bates and Corbett method) are quite simple and do not require a lot of time. But remember that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Please first of all carefully read description of every exercise. If description says that movement should be smooth, it's important. If you see breathing instructions, please pay attention and follow them. If you always keep such nuances in mind, your exercises and rest will be most effective.\r\nPlease note that this app provides not only exercise descriptions but also notifications about training times and reminders about eye relaxation.

            "Very worst app.dont expect more with this and not to decide anything with this all are showing very small letters and can't be find even u can wear glasses. in case u can find it by using magnifying glass.sorry I didn't try with that bcoz I didn't have that much sight. Don't waste ur time by installing this app.",
            "I find it very helpful especially for my children as they can't memorize the letters! Unlike the usual eye test charts and you can put in the distance you are able to see and hold the phone at this distance which is more realistic. I struggle to get them to look at the eye charts and they like screens though I don't like them using screens! Very useful tool though.",
            "it's great, except, once or twice the icon that indicates which eye to cover didn't switch, although the result was given as though it. had. further, i was expecting greater variety in font size, once I'd hit \"nothing\", a few times.... i cannot comment on acuity, at present. it's potentially useful, but for now, not yet worthy of storage space.",
            "I'm not sure ? I tried all of the images. Each one gave a different result. Mostly in my left eye. My right eye was also different but much closer to the same range. The instructions are simple. So I'm not sure what to rate it at. I'm going to try again using the same imagine each time.adding to my review, 2 weeks down the road. I've kept taking my eye exams . I stuck with the same symbols each time. I believe it to be more accurate this way. I'm giving 4 stars after truly trying it out!"

            "I've had this app on my phone a year now and enjoy using it very much. I find the exercises quite useful and relaxing as I'm on the computer roughly 12-to-16 hours daily at home. It has reduced eye fatigue and improved my vision significantly. A very useful tool with adjustable schedule and exercises for multiple daily use. I highly recommend it.",
            "Very useful! I'm someone who's been to a few eye doctors and this feels right.",
            "When I relax myself and read the instructions and then do it. My eyes fell refreshed. This may not work for everyone. But I noticed that while looking at my devices I very seldom blink my eyes or move my eyes around, I just steady stare. But this APP needs to give me an option choice, if I want a pop-up to remind me to exercise my eyes. And then let me automatically return to what I was doing.",
            "Even though some comments says that we can't read what is written while you're exercisesing it vibrates I tried it the first time and I love. 5 star💗💗 I feel refreshed every time I use this application"

            "Good app. But i think it would be better if the reminder breaks notify with sound and the breaks alert should come while the phone is in use as per the usage time, not at a specific interval of time. Otherwise often the exercises are skipped for later with a thought of just having started using the phone.",
            "Good idea, but limited options. Short breaks are spaced max 30 mins. I only want a short break once an hour. Long break is max at 80 mins. I want a long break every 3 hours. I'd be happy to pay the $2.69 for premium if it had the features i needed. Uninstalling and I'll keep looking.",
            "Overall good but I dont want this to appear when screen is locked. There is no point in doing that. It should only show up when Im using the phone. Also Im ok with banner ads but video ads is just too much hence im uninstalling. Thanks.",
            "It is a good app to set a reminder for your eyes to rest and to exercise them throughout the day. However, the apps reminder stopped working. Kind of just stuck. I tried to deactivate it and activate it again, but didn't work.",
            "Wrost App I have ever seen. It's not remainding for taking breaks for every 20 minutes. Don't install the app. It's a scam. Fraud app . I think who ever made this app, the biggest cheater. Nothing is telling me. It's don't remind or helpful. Please don't purchase by buying. It does nothing wrost app."

Find out if you are at higher risk for eye diseases.\r\nBe aware of your family's health history. Do you or any of your family suffer from diabetes or have a history of high blood pressure?

Have regular physical exams to check for diabetes and high blood pressure.\r\nIf left untreated, these diseases can cause eye problems. In particular, diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to vision loss from diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and eye strokes.\r\n\r\n3. Look for warning signs of changes in your vision.\r\nIf you start noticing changes in your vision, see your eye doctor immediately. Some trouble signs to look for are double vision, hazy vision and difficulty seeing in low light conditions.\r\n\r\nOther signs and symptoms of potentially serious eye problems that warrant immediate attention include red eyes, frequent flashes of light, floaters, and eye pain and swelling.\r\n\r\n4.

One reqyest: Can you make the FOCUS training type have a level where the lines are thinner (like in MULTI II), on a white background, and moving to the smallest possible size? The moving farther and shorter is relaxing, but it can additionally challenge the eyes if the lines are thinner. Thank you! *I cant read korean*",

Unfortunately, it seems to no longer work and constantly crash, I hope the issue gets resolved quickly.",

I have Screen Filter to turn my brightness down past what Samsung allows, that app DARKENS your screen, that's it. Simple. I LOVE IT! The only reason I needed to switch is that that app is so simple, I can't schedule when it runs. I CAN do that with this one but with so many it these, it makes your screen RED even when set to \"daylight\" it's still colored a little and I just want dark, not color.",

            "This application has been nearly perfect for the year I've been using it, reduces blue light, dims the screen, can set intensity, and lots more. But ever since 10/5/20 the app stopped reducing blue light and the screen's brightness, instead it changes it the the color of the screen to a bright orange, yellow, or white light. Not sure why this just started happening but the app isn't usable anymore and has killed the app experience for me, hope this is fixed soon. Update; seems like it was fixed.",
            "My reading mode doesn't function anymore. The one that is in the phone itself. So I downloaded this app . It is wonderful . I have spectacles so this helps to reduce eye strain. You can adjust the intensity . Different lights available. Like night , fluorescent , dawn etc It's an amazing app. Free of cost too.",
            "This is the app that I can't uninstall no matter how full my storage is already. I really need it and it's easy to use and really functional. It makes my eyes better at night. I always maximize its screen dim. I love this so much. My only suggestion is that you should cover and make the app functional on the notif and status bar because when I turn the wifi on and off it gets really bright.",
            "First and only app I (have) downloaded. Only intention was to schedule a nightly set time that phone \"dims\" and reduces Blue Light. It has unequivocally done that both on a severely aging Samsung 5 and again on newly purchased Pixel4. Granted, nothing to compare it to, but with it hitting my marks with a user friendly interface, I initially programmed my nightly slider filter options and scheduled start/finish times in one minute or less as a 1st time user. Routine adjustments required. 5 stars",
            "This app allows you to not only turn down the blue light but also the screen light. My phones screen light is set to the lowest option and at night in bed it is still too bright. With this app I can turn it all down. I turn it down to an almost visible darkness which causes me to squint to see and lulls me to sleep sooner. It also has the option to pause the dimming to take a Screencast which my other app wouldn't, causing the picture to be super dark."

The human eye needs frequent eye treatment, so it is recommended to do the vision training (or vision therapy) every day for suitable results at your vision improvement. Eye muscles should be trained often for winning your eyesight back (eye test). You will see, it will be like one of the eye games.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout our eye: \r\n\r\nEyes are organs that detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons. The simplest photoreceptors in conscious vision connect light to movement. In higher organisms the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals.\r\n\r\nVisual acuity, or resolving power, is \"the ability to distinguish fine detail\" and is the property of cone cells.

It is often measured in cycles per degree (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles.<br><br>An eye handbook might help you for more info about the eye (or eye tracking).  <br><br>Pro version is like an eye magic app with 8 new trainings including dominant eye recognition and an eye color blindness test!

However, I stopped doing my exercises due to it not being my main priority. I recently resumed doing eye exercises trying other apps as I could not find this one and those top rated apps are not effective at all. They really were a waste of my time. With luck, I was able to find this app again.",

            "This app is good but when you.ve finished listening to it each time..and you click EXIT APP.... it DOES NOT CLOSE APP. And it keeps putting messages up on your screen to click CLOSE APP...which i do but then half an hour later it sends the CLOSE APP notice back up on screen to do it again. This happens a few times EVERY TIME you exit app after use. Please FIX",

            "1.In the previous version the notification was directly a full-screen popup,but now a small popup notification showing skip and show appears.This is of no use, we can't press the \"show\" button each and every time, we NEED a DIRECT FULL SCREEN POPUP notification after the timer period. atleast give both the options for user to choose. 2. Check out BREAK TIMER APP for windows u will get lot of ideas to customise this app. PS: I am using asus zenfone max pro m2 mobile with stock Android 9 version",
            "Works what its supposed to do, i like how the developer listens to feedback, also the graphic for the sound button is flipped, when the sound is on is has an image of a turned off speaket and vice versa. Still a nitpick. Worth downloading",
            "Just loved it. Minimal and effective. serves the purpose of promodoro app ✌️",
            "Ever since classes were suspended I've been on my phone for hours on end. This caused a stabbing pain behind my eyes, probably due to eye strain. I looked into the 20-20-20 rule and found this app (its competitor didn't seem appealing) and the pain has since subsided. Dropping my screen periodically to stare out of my window is also pleasantly meditative. I've set a 40sec eye break every 35mins. I'd add 1 more star if the app didn't buzz when my screen is off. SOLID app in every other respect."

But still like it, just needs updating since I've paid for it. Update over a year later and still no improvement. Doesn't cover the bottom onscreen buttons or the pull down notifications. Changed review to 2 star.",
            "its a nice app, but the problems i encountered are that when i pull down my notification panel the lights still remains the same as it was when i have not installed Bluelight Filter and also the Bluelight Filter is not also applied on the lock screen of my phone. Whenever i want to unlock my phone, i see no filter light applied on the lock screen it's always the same as before.... i shall only rate the app to five stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟only when the above problems are solved.",
            "This app is TRASH and a SCAM. I paid for the subscription and the app still kept turning off the filter overlay randomly and there would be no way to turn it back on until it decided to turn itself back on. I don't have time for an app that's only going to work when IT decides to.",

        "description": "Generally speaking, the screens on smartphones, tablets, desktop computers, and other LED screens emit a blue light. This light can be harmful to your vision, especially when you expose yourself directly to it at night or when there isn't any sunlight. Bluelight Blocking is an application that helps you avoid this light by manually modifying the type of light emitted by these screens.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you have to do is adjust the transparency filters according to what you want for different occasions. The higher the filter level, the more opaque and less lit-up the screen will be, so you can read, play, or work without your eyes watering or drying out. When you want to change this value, all you have to do is slide the bar to the position that you want.\r\n\r\nThe selection of filters to choose from is enough to find the best choice for each moment: red, yellow, brown, and black are the four possibilities. When you activate one of them, you can see how the blue light becomes less harmful and easier on the eyes. You'll also be consuming less resources, so you won't burn through your battery quite as fast as long as you have Bluelight Blocking activated.\r\n\r\nTo access this application more quickly, you can set up a shortcut on the configuration menu. This way, if you want to have a shortcut to the notifications panel, you can have it display when the the filter is activated, when it's deactivated, or always. Adjust your screen and stop hurting your vision, whether it's during the day or at night.\r\n\r\nWhy should we care about blue light?\r\n\r\nBlue light is part of visible light spectrum that we are exposed to it by the sun every day. However, nighttime exposure to the light at high levels by smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other LED screens may impair your vision. \r\n\r\nIt also suppresses the production of hormone melatonin, which hinders your body's natural sleep cues.\r\n\r\nWhen your melatonin level and sleep cycle are disrupted, your risk of a wide range of ailments, from depression to cancer, may go up.\r\n\r\nYou can get help by using apps that limit the amount of blue light coming from our screens.\r\n\r\n※ When trying to download other apps you need from other than Google Play Store, sometimes they are not installed properly with the bluelight filter is activated. In such case, please turn off the bluelight filter for a moment and install other applications.\r\n\r\n※ Battery consumption is low when the filter is applied, due to low total CPU usage except for low CPU usage.",

Since he installed your app on my old tablet + the one I just purchased.. my eyes aren't as tired, painful or as worn thanks 2 this app.Excellent. Can honestly say I've been using this app for about 3 months and its never given me a difficult time. I get frequent headaches and my job has me looking at a screen all day, so when I use",

        "description": "Take care of your eyes!\r\n\r\nThe application will allow you to form healthy habits for your eyes.\r\n\r\n⚠️ EYES PROTECTIONS\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigation by the famous British oculist, the number of people suffering from myopia has increased by 36% compared with 1997, when there were no smartphones, and mobile phones began to come into use. If the progression continues, then by 2035 more than half of the people around the world (55%) will have poor eyesight.\r\n\r\nSmartphones and tablets cause much more harm to eyesight than computers. Of course, the reason lies in the diagonal of the screen. To see what is written on the tiny display of a smartphone, you have to bring the device too close to the eye, and this negatively affects the concentration of vision and contributes to the destruction of the macula, the eye area that allows a person to distinguish small details.\r\n\r\nThe main thing to take care of is the distance from the smartphone to the eyes. The smartphone screen must be placed 30 cm from the face.\r\n\r\n★ HOW DOES IT WORK?\r\n\r\nThe application checks the distance from the phone screen to your face. If the distance from the screen to the face is closer than you configured, the phone screen will lock and ask you to remove the screen farther. After you fulfill the request, the screen is unlocked.\r\n\r\nThe triggering distance depends on the model and camera characteristics of your device, but you can adjust the triggering distance for eye protection yourself. Launch any application and bring the phone close to your eyes. Wait up when the protection triggers and evaluate the distance. If it is insufficient or exceeds the norm, adjusts the sensitivity in the application settings.\r\n\r\n⚠️ EYE PROTECTION AGAINST THE BLUE LIGHT OF THE PHONE SCREEN\r\n\r\nBlue light - a part of visible light with a wavelength of 380–780 nm, directly affects the biological rhythms of a person, the cycles of vigor and sleep. Phone screens emit blue light and its excessive exposure is especially dangerous for the eyes, causing symptoms of digital visual fatigue, eye damage, and behavioral disturbances. As noted in the report (Harvard health publications), blue light may even be associated with the development of certain types of cancer (possibly as a result of a decrease in melatonin levels).\r\n\r\n★ HOW DOES IT WORK?\r\n\r\nThe night mode filter changes the blue radiation (harmful to your sleep) of the screen to warmer tones. The principle of operation is based on overlaying filter overall windows. A color temperature below 3500K will improve sleep quality and allow you to read at night in comfort, which can have a beneficial effect on sleep quality.\r\n\r\n⚠️ Application features\r\n\r\n• Eyes Protection - helps you keep your device at the correct distance from your eyes, which helps you create healthy habits for your eyes.\r\n• Pre-installed blue light filters - use one of the pre-installed filters to reduce the effect of blue light on your eyes.\r\n• Automatically turn on filters - set a timer to automatically turn on the blue light filter at night.\r\n• Filter intensity - allows you to adjust the intensity of the glow of the device screen.\r\n• Reduced power consumption - allows you to reduce battery consumption on most devices, by reducing the intensity of the glow of the device screen (relevant for AMOLED screens).\r\n\r\nCheck out the subscription price: https://eyespro.net\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\nIf you have any issues or questions, you can always contact our support team: support@eyespro.net\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\nDrawing on top of other applications - required to apply a blue light filter.",

In fact it has got much worse gradually over time, it now happens more frequently. When it shuts down my phones standard brightness settings reactivate which is far too bright for me. I have to stop whatever I'm doing and go into the Bluelight Filter app for it to put the filter settings back to normal. I will be looking for an alternative app.",

        "description": "This eye test is designed to monitor a person's central visual field in the most pleasant, intuitive and stress-free way for FREE.\r\n\r\nVision test is useful for:\r\n- Patients with macular degeneration (usually instructed to monitor their vision daily)\r\n- House visits\r\n- Household tests for adults who have doubts if a doctor's visit is required\r\n- Nursing homes\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Random test charts to eliminate boring and repeating experiences;\r\n- Voice controls to help you navigate easier;\r\n- Smooth and intuitive interface with animations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis eye examination is of particular interest to reveal age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which mostly affects adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment for adults over 50 years. Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to pass this test a couple of times each year no matter what your age is.\r\n\r\nThe amsler grid used in this examination is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula (e.g. macular degeneration, Epiretinal membrane), as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain. A particular problem is the age-related macular degeneration.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is made with the best of intentions. The intuitive and flawless design allows you to navigate easily through the application. The voice guidance is provided during the test so that you don't need to move your mobile device near or far to read the instructions but instead you can hear the nice voice guiding you through different steps and actions. The voice can easily be muted and unmuted.\r\n\r\nIn the test, you will be given a small dot in the center of the grid. One should identify if any of the straight lines are wavy, missing or have other disorder. At the end of the test results will show whether the person has problems in central visual field or not for each eye separately.\r\n\r\nMore details about central visual field, macular degeneration, retina, eye examination tests and trainings as well as other eye related topics can be found in our news.eyeexamtest.com blog.\r\n\r\nThe Central Vision Test is continuously under improvement so your feedback is appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\n- Take the most comfortable position to relax.\r\n- Have a mild nature light and no glare on the phone screen.\r\n- Wear your contacts or glasses if you normally do.\r\n- Place your phone approx. 50 cm/20 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Cover one eye at a time with your hand.\r\n- Stare at the dot in the center.

        "descriptionHTML": "This eye test is designed to monitor a person&#39;s central visual field in the most pleasant, intuitive and stress-free way for FREE.<br><br>Vision test is useful for:<br>- Patients with macular degeneration (usually instructed to monitor their vision daily)<br>- House visits<br>- Household tests for adults who have doubts if a doctor&#39;s visit is required<br>- Nursing homes<br><br><br>Features:<br>- Random test charts to eliminate boring and repeating experiences;<br>- Voice controls to help you navigate easier;<br>- Smooth and intuitive interface with animations.<br><br><br>Description:<br><br>This eye examination is of particular interest to reveal age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which mostly affects adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment for adults over 50 years. Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life.<br><br>It is recommended to pass this test a couple of times each year no matter what your age is.<br><br>The amsler grid used in this examination is a diagnostic tool that aids in the detection of visual disturbances caused by changes in the retina, particularly the macula (e.g. macular degeneration, Epiretinal membrane), as well as the optic nerve and the visual pathway to the brain. A particular problem is the age-related macular degeneration.<br><br>The Central Vision Test is made with the best of intentions. The intuitive and flawless design allows you to navigate easily through the application. The voice guidance is provided during the test so that you don&#39;t need to move your mobile device near or far to read the instructions but instead you can hear the nice voice guiding you through different steps and actions. The voice can easily be muted and unmuted.<br><br>In the test, you will be given a small dot in the center of the grid. One should identify if any of the straight lines are wavy, missing or have other disorder. At the end of the test results will show whether the person has problems in central visual field or not for each eye separately.<br><br>More details about central visual field, macular degeneration, retina, eye examination tests and trainings as well as other eye related topics can be found in our news.eyeexamtest.com blog.<br><br>The Central Vision Test is continuously under improvement so your feedback is appreciated!<br><br><br>Tips:<br><br>- Take the most comfortable position to relax.<br>- Have a mild nature light and no glare on the phone screen.<br>- Wear your contacts or glasses if you normally do.<br>- Place your phone approx. 50 cm/20 inches from your eyes.<br>- Cover one eye at a time with your hand.<br>- Stare at the dot in the center.

            "I can definitely see the difference in tint of my screen when the filter is on and I like the notification bar widget that lets you control whether the filter is active with a single tap. It also only requires two permissions to draw over other apps and the OS to keep the whole screen changed and it's easy to schedule it to turn on. Although, the filter stops working after awhile and I'm not even sure if the schedule works or not.",
            "Easy to use and toggle. Unlike other apps I've tried, it has the option to keep the on and off option at the top of the notification area so it is always accessible. I also like that it supports more than one intensity of overlay; having options is much nicer than not having options.",
            "Was the best night light filter out there but since I updated to Android 11 it bugs every time I watch a video on full-screen (the filter only covers a square in the center of the screen while two big sides of the screen so not have the filter). Other than that it works well. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars. Also, don't push premium on me every time I turn on the app, allow users to choose \"no, thank you\" instead of \"later\".",
            "Honestly, this is really a good app which helps us prevent the exposure of blue light of the screen for better eye health. But, sometimes all of sudden it stops working, especially when I open some apps like sticky notes, YouTube, VPN, etc, so I have to open this app and turn it on again. Rather inconvenience sometimes. I hope there will be some improvement about it. Thanks in advance :)",
            "Some bugs, like occasional it stops working, and when setting up a new filter it will revert to full brightness during the set up, but potentially this could be one of the best blue filter programs I've tried. I have light or medium on during the day and dark at night. It would be nice to be able to set up a schedule for this. You can set up your own filters too, or adjust the pre-sets to get it how you want it."

            "This app is amazing. I know gabor patches to improve eye sight but the way this app displays it makes it so effective on the brain. I am now seeing things the way I saw them when I was a kid; so vivid. Sometimes I just go outside just to look at things. This is amazing. However I found it a bit difficult at the beginning on how to play the game, but once I got it, I play it everyday for at least 20 minutes. The developer should make a very detailed tutorial on how to play with video examples",
            "App functioned, free. Like the candy game but with Gabor patches. If the benefit of Gabor is just the result of focusing on patches, then this game should help improve the visual problems that other programs with Gabor patches do. If there is more to neuroadaptation training than just focus (for example, if the order of the series matters), then who knows if this will help. I will do it for 20 minutes a day & report back on whether it helps my halos and ghost images from a multifocal IOL.",
            "This app is basically unusable (by anyone except the developer, perhaps). The description calls it \"a match-3 game\", but there are no instructions on HOW you match those 3. I've tried tapping, sliding, long-pressing, and nothing works. And the \"how to play\" link does nothing.  Don't waste your time.",
            "Well it is basically a game but I'm not sure that it actually helps with certain eyesight issues. Simple",
            "You need to explain how people can play the game. What do we have to do? Do we have to wait until all patterns are aligned? How do we do it? Slide 3 patterns downwards or vertically? And how do we know whether we did good or need to improve? How do we know our eyesight can become better? Are there levels of difficulties? What are those symbols for? Change colours? Why? Etc."

It gets stuck on the part where you're asked to hold a credit/debit card up to the screen, and repeats the instruction to do so non-stop regardless of how near or far you have the camera in regard to the screen. I tried holding it in place, and even set it on a phone stand for stability. Still didn't work. It's a good idea in theory, but in practice the execution is poor. On the off-chance that the developers respond to this, please don't respond with the same canned greeting/apology that I've seen on everyone else's reviews. Don't provide me with your support number, because the last thing I want to do is sit up on the phone with customer service for an app that is more trouble than it's worth.

Shifting your screen to night mode can relieve your eyes strain, and your eyes will feel at ease during night reading. Also blue light filter will protect your eyes and help you sleep easily.\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Reduce blue light\r\n- Adjustable filter intensity\r\n- Save power\r\n- Very easy to use\r\n- Built-in screen dimmer\r\n- Eye protector from screen light\r\n- Make sure you are in a comfortable position\r\n- Make sure that there is no glare on the phone's screen.\r\n- Place your phone approximately 40 cm/16 inches from your eyes.\r\n- Close one eye at a time\r\n\r\nTake care of your vision. With this program you can test your vision at home. It can't replace optician's regular full examination or advise of ophthalmologist, but with this vision test you may discover that your eyesight deteriorates and you need to visit a doctor.\r\n\r\nDuring the test you will see different objects. Try to identify shown object. The sequence of objects is random. That prevents learning the sequence and guessing the answer.\r\nHere are some helpful tips to help you avoid vision loss from these age-related eye diseases and other problems:\r\n\r\n1. Find out if you are at higher risk for eye diseases.\r\nBe aware of your family's health history. Do you or any of your family suffer from diabetes or have a history of high blood pressure? Are you over age 60? Any of these traits increase your risk for sight-threatening eye diseases.\r\n\r\n2. Have regular physical exams to check for diabetes and high blood pressure.\r\nIf left untreated, these diseases can cause eye problems. In particular, diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to vision loss from diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and eye strokes.\r\n\r\n3. Look for warning signs of changes in your vision.\r\nIf you start noticing changes in your vision, see your eye doctor immediately. Some trouble signs to look for are double vision, hazy vision and difficulty seeing in low light conditions.\r\n\r\nOther signs and symptoms of potentially serious eye problems that warrant immediate attention include red eyes, frequent flashes of light, floaters, and eye pain and swelling.\r\n\r\n4. Exercise frequently.\r\nStudies suggest that regular exercise — such as brisk walking — can reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration by up to 70 percent.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nThis application is not intended to replace optician's regular full examination.

And once your done you have to do another thing that takes another 2 minutes. Then when you try to change the colour of your eyes it doesn't work! The colour is only in the centre of your eyes not even in the Iris which is where the colour is supposed to go! Don't get this app it is HORRIBLE! If I could give it zero stars I would.",

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

            "A very beautiful and relaxing nonogram. I've been recently playing nonograms (Picross Luna, Two eyes, etc.) and this is one of the best ones I've played! The pictures are simply breathtaking and the puzzles are really fun. I also liked the story but like other nonograms, it takes a while to finish. The music is relaxing and it makes me feel calm. Overall 10/10.",
            "It's beautiful, fairly well-designed, with lovely art, and they took the time to write extensive narratives. Update: Game is great, but when you zoom in on the larger puzzles, clue numbers don't get magnified, so they're still tiny and hard to read.",
            "Great nonogram game!!! It's not my favourite game(Two Eyes), but I love the art, music, UI, animations, everything! The one thing I don't like is how it's a bit slow to go to the next level. Yes, it is pretty with special effects after you finish a puzzle, but it gets annoying when you speed through 10x10 puzzles in a minute and have to wait a few seconds for the animation to pass... but maybe that's just me. It'd be better if there was an option to disable these awesome animations",
            "They have made the free version of this game nearly unplayable. There are sever ads that will launch with no way to close them. The ads will take the entire screen and the app needs to be force quit in order to function again. This happens after every puzzle. The game itself is great. It is a truly beautiful game with great story. I was planning on purchasing but now refuse. I will not support developers who make a game unplayable. If you want the money just make it a paid only game.",
            "I love this game. It's one of the few nonogram games I've found that is forgiving towards mistakes, but also having decent controls. I think that the one drawback for me is the fact that i don't have the option of being able to see the original pixel art after i complete a chapter. I really love the art, but it feels like my part of it disappears, never to be seen again. Edit:Nevermind. Also, i appreciate the fact that the ads aren't a huge issue, and they're not annoying and don't break the app"

            "My true purpose for trying this app was to help with digestive issues I've experienced for the past two years. Figured, why not? This helps! Matter of fact, I would rate it top 3 of what is putting my system back on track. I've been using this app for about 8 months now and I absolutely love it. As of right now, at almost 50 and normal weight, my pelvic muscles are on point. ( Sorry if that sounds awkward.) This app keeps me focused and, oftentimes, I meditate through these exercises.",
            "Simple, effective. This has 2 simple types of Kegel exercises, performed after each other. It builds repetition and time slowly each day. Perfect for post hysterectomy. It gives a discreet reminder on my phone. I have the app set to vibrate times during exercises so I can close my eyes and concentrate rather than counting or watching clock. I HIGHLY recommend.",
            "I love this I have tried doing legal excercise on my own but would not feel like I was doing them correctly. This app shows me how to make progress. I have been doing this for about a week and can feel the muscles getting a little toner I guess you would say. I am not sure how to say it. I just feel it working",
            "I like the exercises in this app for basic squeeze-release kegels, and that they slowly progress each day without you having to advanced them, much as a personal trainer would do. My only two gripes so far after using it for a few days, and why it fell short of five stars, are that I wish there was at count down before beginning the exercises like 3-2-1-go, and I wish you could set reminders to do the exercises multiple times a day.",
            "Ads are not intrusive at all. Design of app good. Can do anywhere and noone knows what you're doing. The graph is encouraging to try and get yourself up the levels! Straightforward; thank you!"

Twilight may be a solution for you!\r\n\r\nRecent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\r\n\r\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour. See references below..\r\n\r\nThe Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\nhttp://twilight.urbandroid.org/doc/\r\n\r\nGet more from Twilight\r\n1) Bed reading: Twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading.

            "I love this app. I get massive migraines and become very sensitive to light, but my phone is the only device I can keep using as long as this app is on. It allows me to play my games or read my online books to try to relax when in the midst of a migraine. Definitely the first thing I install on a new phone! Thank you so much for creating this!",
            "The first time I installed the app, I didn't understand how to manage the settings and I rushed and uninstall it. It's after some months I took out my time to carefully go through it and realized that it is one of the best screen filtering apps. I salute the developers of this app and wish you more wisdom to create more better apps for the world.",
            "Wonderful app. Easy to use. Great for those of us who get up for 30 min in middle of night before going back to sleep. Sure beats staring at ceiling for hours. The relaxing red dust storm tone is peaceful when you inevitably check your phone. Also great for going to bed as you set dimmer and brighter times. Also great for whatever went beep in the night on your phone that you don't get hit with the searchlight that iluminates your skull till your ears glow.",
            "This actually helped me go to sleep ! Im shook! My problem is...first off theres settings that im totally not comftable with nor understand. Also the whole time i was using it.. I was getting warnings of battery being used way to much & it was! Also it was using my data! To much of it! Im gonna try a different one. 😔",
            "I've used this app for over 2 years. I really like it for using my phone in the evening, and I have a small child who's often up in the night and so it's great to have the settings for nighttime use when I'm up with her. Very customisable. Highly recommend."

            "Works great & easy adjustment options. Fast functions. Needs force refocus button or tap screen to speed up shooting out of focus images. Auto focus adjusts but takes moving the phone up and down to get the camera to refocus. Needs to abort gallery view after last shot deleted automaticly. Now you have to close it yourself but the app could detect last shot deleted and then close the gallery view. Then return back to take a new shot. Other then that excelent app. Great job. No ads. Ron@Memphis",
            "I've tried a few of these magnifying apps, and I like this one the best by far. It offers all kinds of options without annoying ads popping up taking up part of the screen where you may accidentally click on them. The auto mode works great even in low light. I don't always carry reading glasses with me, but I always have my phone. Perfect!",
            "Contains ads, sure does. Other than that, it works well on LG G7. Would have rated higher if it hadn't hit me with an ad 5 seconds after opening the app. I tapped to pick the ambient light and blap, full screen ad, adjusted the +magnification several taps and blap, full screen ad. Nice layout and ability to change settings.",
            "Works great, just like it says. This is \"The Best Magnifier App\" that I've found in Google Play Store!!! I really like the different modes, such as twilight & day. I like having the option to record and take photos. Plus the auto focus & flash help a lot. I recommend this Ap, its a must have for anybody!!!",
            "Why this app stopped again again in my device. When i start video then why it seems closed the app. Can you help me"

            "I like most of the features on this app, and I love that everything is free and that they're not fronting like they're trying to help like some other apps I've used. The only issue I've run into is that when I try to post a forum, it tells me I haven't created an account even when I just logged in. Not sure if it's a problem on my end or theirs",
            "I absolutely love this app. I only installed it an hour ago and I can already see how much efforts the developers have put into it. As a student psychologist I'm afraid this app is going to put counselors out of job- this is to indicate how effective and helpful I find it. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. This is just what I needed.",
            "Hi! I have been using this great app for the past year and it has been very relieving. However, there is a glitch that needs to be fixed: - I chose a blue background and a blue button colour from the Theme Colours, and when I try to tap on the 'Themes' button to change again, the button does not function! Is this because the background and button are the same colour? Overall I am satisfied but please do something about this glitch!!! Please fix it soon!! Thank you.",
            "First day using this app and I am blown away! It was so so helpful and I just wish it was recognised more, as it wasn't very easy for me to find. The only thing I wish was more easier, was to make an account, for the forum. When attempting to comment, a notification popped up informing me that I needed to create anaccount, however I had quite a but of trouble creating the account, although that's nor worth taking a star off so it's still 5/5 stars for me! I highly suggest installing this app!!!",
            "I downloaded this app with testing purposes in mind. I give it 5 stars because it's rather evident that the development team has put a lot of effort and hard work to it. I'd like to suggest giving some sort of interactive module with scheduled activities to be completed as some kind of mental health maintenance protocol, maybe with 4 weeks of duration. Thanks for doing this!"

        "description": "Ajna, the Third Eye, is located in a sacred spot: Hindus usually paint it with red to show respect. Its activation site, in fact, is right between the eyebrows in a position known as the third eye. Even if you do not have a lot of familiarity with chakras, you may have heard of this term already. The ones who meditate on the indigo chakra are said to be granted occult powers; they will be able to enter another body at will and to become omniscient.\r\n\r\nTo balance this chakra, we created Third Eye Cleansing, an App that will allow you to play a 144Hz tone that will help you clear this energy center while meditating on it. This binaural isochronic tone can be made even more pleasant thanks to the 7 relaxing songs you can play in the background. The first one is free, while the others can be downloaded in the premium version. The titles of the tracks in our playlist are as follows, and can be used to heal your soul:\r\n\r\n1. Visualization \r\n2. Perception \r\n3. Eye of the Soul \r\n4. Heaven and Earth \r\n5. Healing Balancing \r\n6. Divine Bliss \r\n7. Lucid Dreams \r\n\r\nTo improve your experience, we added a timer to control exactly how long you will meditate. You can unlock it in the premium version, and set precisely how long to listen to our music to relax.\r\n\r\nWhy is it important to meditate on Ajna while using music to relax? The third chakra's name can be translated as command; it can be considered the center of intellect and intuition. When something is seen in a dream, it is seen by Ajna. When you understand something or you have an epiphany, it is thanks to Anja. The sixth chakra is a bridge that connects minds, allowing communication to take place between us not only on a physical level but on a transcendental one as well.\r\n\r\nWe hope you can improve your moments of harmony and serenity through this app. May it help you find peace and wellbeing through your seven chakras. For any suggestions, problems or requests, please contact us at support@rehegoo.com",

        "description": "The lazy eye or amblyopia, is the most frequent reason of loss of vision among children and young people in developed countries and affects, approximately, 3% of the population. It happens as a result of inadequate brain processing, because one of the eyes does not communicate well with the brain (it can be due to multiple causes such as strabismus, differences in gradation between both eyes, anisometropia, aniseiconía, congenital cataracts) not reaching the optimal visual acuity , nor using the best optical correction. Which causes the weaker eye to be suppressed by the stronger eye. People with lazy eye do not have a developed percepcle of depth. It is very important to correct this visual defect during childhood (before 7 or 8 years), because if it is passed, the patient can completely lose the vision of the eye that does not use.\r\n\r\nThe treatment for amblyopia is to force to use the lazy eye. The most popular is for the child to wear the 'good' eye patch for several hours every day for a few weeks or months. Once childhood is over, there is nothing to do for lack of cerebral plasticity. However, game has been found to be effective at treating adult amblyopia, also known as 'lazy eye', according to new researchs. The information of the game is shared by both eyes, forcing them to cooperate. Patients who played with both eyes experienced a significant improvement in their vision of the weaker eye after only two weeks. By making both eyes cooperate, the amblyopic brain is able to relearn as a result of an increase in the level of plasticity in the brain.\r\n\r\nThese games can help you. With the right settings, applications can force the brain to use both eyes simultaneously to teach the brain proper image processing. Each part of the image is filtered only by one of the two eyes and this is achieved through a color filtering by putting on anaglyph glasses. Always make sure that only one of the eyes can see the left or right color. Playing the game requires that information be sent to both eyes to work cooperatively.\r\n\r\nMore info in: \r\nwww.envemos.com",

It is very important to correct this visual defect during childhood (before 7 or 8 years), because if it is passed, the patient can completely lose the vision of the eye that does not use.<br><br>The treatment for amblyopia is to force to use the lazy eye. The most popular is for the child to wear the &#39;good&#39; eye patch for several hours every day for a few weeks or months. Once childhood is over, there is nothing to do for lack of cerebral plasticity. However, game has been found to be effective at treating adult amblyopia, also known as &#39;lazy eye&#39;, according to new researchs. The information of the game is shared by both eyes, forcing them to cooperate. Patients who played with both eyes experienced a significant improvement in their vision of the weaker eye after only two weeks. By making both eyes cooperate, the amblyopic brain is able to relearn as a result of an increase in the level of plasticity in the brain.<br><br>These games can help you. With the right settings, applications can force the brain to use both eyes simultaneously to teach the brain proper image processing. Each part of the image is filtered only by one of the two eyes and this is achieved through a color filtering by putting on anaglyph glasses. Always make sure that only one of the eyes can see the left or right color. Playing the game requires that information be sent to both eyes to work cooperatively.<br><br>More info in: <br>www.envemos.com",

It does NOT ask for a ridiculously high amount of unreasonable permissions and is really light, causing no impact on the performance of the device. Also, it has all the features needed for the job.",

        "description": "Prevention is better than cure. Designed for children older than 6, parents with young children, and general practitioners, this app displays optically precise optotypes of tumbling E chart for you to measure distant visual acuity accurately in order to detect nearsightedness or myopia and early,  so you can take preventive measures and seek help from medical professional early to prevent pseudomyopia from becoming myopia, or prevent nearsightedness from getting worse.\r\n\r\nPredefined Test Distances:\r\n* 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 meters\r\n* 20, 15, 12, 10, 6 feet\r\n\r\nAt exactly 6 meters away from the “patient”, the optotypes on the 6/6 line (Decimal 1.0 or LogMar 0.0) shall subtend 5 minutes of arc, which means that the chart should be sized such that these optotypes are 8.73mm tall, and the topmost (Snellen Fraction 6/60, Decimal 0.1, or LogMar 1.0) optotypes should be 87.3 mm tall. At exactly 20 feet away from the “patient”, the topmost optotypes should be 88.7 mm tall, because 20 feet equals 6.096 meters. \r\n\r\nScenarios:\r\n1. \"Doctor\" and \"Patient\".\r\n2. Self-diagnosis with a mirror.\r\n3. Self-diagnosis with a Bluetooth keyboard.\r\n4. Self-diagnosis within arm's reach.\r\n\r\nNotations：\r\n1. Decimal (0.50)\r\n2. Fraction (20/40)\r\n3. LogMAR (0.30)\r\n4. Fraction (5/10)\r\n5. Fraction (6/12)\r\n6. MAR (2)\r\n7. VAS or VAR (85)\r\n\r\nTest Modes:\r\n1. Autoplay\r\n2. Manual\r\n\r\nIn Autoplay, the app calculates the score. For LogMAR notation,  the score is (LogMAR value of the best line read) + 0.02 x (number of optotypes missed). And the maximum missed is 3. For VAS notation, the score is an inversion of the logMAR scale, based on VAS=100-50xlogMAR. For other notations, the score is the notation value of the best line read and optionally minus number of optotypes missed, and the maximum missed is 2.\r\n\r\nBy default, setting \"Play Interval Until Next Optotype\" is none. Available intervals in second: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. If the \"patient\" could not recognize the optotype within the interval, this counts a miss.\r\n\r\nThrough enabling “Record Scores” in Settings, you can keep track of the progression of your visual acuity. Visual acuity scores of multiple testees could be recorded. Visual Acuity Score (VAS) is an inversion of the logMAR scale, based on VAS=100-50xlogMAR. It is more intuitive since higher values indicate better visual acuity.\r\n\r\nIn the scores review, score 100 in blue indicates the reference standard, scores above 100 in green indicates no myopia, while scores below 100 in red may indicate myopia. \r\n\r\nTesting for myopia takes several procedures and the first step is often to check distant visual acuity through a visual acuity chart. And the decrement of visual acuity may indicate the development of myopia.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nWhile this app may replace Tumbling E Chart in print, however it cannot replace doctors and optometrists who carry out comprehensive tests for your eyes. Please visit optometrists regularly and seek help from medical professional at early signs of visual acuity problems.",

At exactly 20 feet away from the “patient”, the topmost optotypes should be 88.7 mm tall, because 20 feet equals 6.096 meters. <br><br>Scenarios:<br>1. &quot;Doctor&quot; and &quot;Patient&quot;.<br>2. Self-diagnosis with a mirror.<br>3. Self-diagnosis with a Bluetooth keyboard.<br>4. Self-diagnosis within arm&#39;s reach.<br><br>Notations：<br>1. Decimal (0.50)<br>2. Fraction (20/40)<br>3. LogMAR (0.30)<br>4. Fraction (5/10)<br>5. Fraction (6/12)<br>6. MAR (2)<br>7. VAS or VAR (85)<br><br>Test Modes:<br>1. Autoplay<br>2. Manual<br><br>In Autoplay, the app calculates the score. For LogMAR notation,  the score is (LogMAR value of the best line read) + 0.02 x (number of optotypes missed). And the maximum missed is 3. For VAS notation, the score is an inversion of the logMAR scale, based on VAS=100-50xlogMAR. For other notations, the score is the notation value of the best line read and optionally minus number of optotypes missed, and the maximum missed is 2.<br><br>By default, setting &quot;Play Interval Until Next Optotype&quot; is none. Available intervals in second: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. If the &quot;patient&quot; could not recognize the optotype within the interval, this counts a miss.<br><br>Through enabling “Record Scores” in Settings, you can keep track of the progression of your visual acuity. Visual acuity scores of multiple testees could be recorded. Visual Acuity Score (VAS) is an inversion of the logMAR scale, based on VAS=100-50xlogMAR. It is more intuitive since higher values indicate better visual acuity.<br><br>In the scores review, score 100 in blue indicates the reference standard, scores above 100 in green indicates no myopia, while scores below 100 in red may indicate myopia. <br><br>Testing for myopia takes several procedures and the first step is often to check distant visual acuity through a visual acuity chart. And the decrement of visual acuity may indicate the development of myopia.<br><br>Disclaimer:<br>While this app may replace Tumbling E Chart in print, however it cannot replace doctors and optometrists who carry out comprehensive tests for your eyes. Please visit optometrists regularly and seek help from medical professional at early signs of visual acuity problems.",

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "I used to use your app to help with my joint pain . But the latest update screwed up the app . It starts out clear but 30 seconds in ir gets scratchy and unusable. I wish you would fix it. You really need to update your app for the galaxy s8 phone. As it,is I can no longer use it !!!! IF IT would work I'd give it a five star rating",
            "The default volume setting is 100% with no option available to change that setting. So when you turn on the sounds, your ears are getting blasted with a dangerous decibel level. Given you're supposed to listen to binaural beats with headphones, this will end up damaging someone's hearing. Immediate uninstall here!",
            "My favorite meditation, music, frequency app. The offerings are the best variety I've seen and I like the customizations you can make to the sound levels in the selfeggio frequency section. You can add in sound elements, like Om, singing bowl strikes, nature sounds and adjust the level of those layers as well. I just purchased the premium and I'm looking forward to exploring everything premium has to offer. Thanks!",
            "Stuttering playback especially on 432 Tibetan, very distracting and unpleasant, after last update it seems to have vastly improved the stuttering, so I have changed my star rating to represent the changes. Some tracks still click and crackle but perhaps that is because my phone. Only problem is that I keep getting notifications to pay for things when I already paid for premium.",
            "I'm not sure what's going on but ever since they did this last update everything is staticky. It don't even have the same effect and it doesn't even sound the same. I don't think that's a good thing considering you have to pay for a membershipand I feel like I'm not getting the most out of that membership now. I might be uninstalling this."

This might be helpful to detect daltonism and color blindess and ensure an early detection of sight problems. However, this app does not replace a visit to the doctor, it is just a different way to get a general idea on your capacity to distinguish colors. If after playing the game you detect that you might have color blindness, daltonism or a lack of color vision you should consider contacting an eye specialist doctor (oculist).\r\n\r\nThese are some of the main characteristics of our game Kuku Kube – Eye Test:\r\n\r\n- Beautiful and colorful design\r\n- Complete statistics\r\n- 4 challenging and unique game modes\r\n- Detailed explanation of how to play\r\n- Cool music\r\n- 2 languages supported\r\n- Visual and sound effects\r\n\r\nKuku Kube – Color Vision Test is a fun game that will challenge your visual capacity.

            "Great work devs. Thanks! Here is ur 5 stared review. Basically this app helps to give a black overlay on your screen so that even if you enable dark mode and encounter a web page or any app with white background then it will glare upon your face but this app helps prevent that annoying glare and have very dim screen. (While using ur phone at night🙂😏🌚",
            "I got this app for screen ghosting. I cant use blue light filters because they cause me seizures. So far because this app also does the notification panel and the settings menu and lets me manipulate colors ,its been the best ive found! No screen ghosting . And no seizures. And all that done while still not taking away deep color. The color is normal with this app and no screen ghosting.Screen can be bright and still no screen ghosting. The best!",
            "This is my #1 most reliable app. I couldn't use my phone at night without it. As someone with light sensitivity and migraines, it's a life saver. It was the first app I downloaded when I got a new phone and had to redownload all my apps.",
            "Wow!!! It's just what you need, with taking just 308kB of space this really helps to darker screen alot. Just I've to buy pro version to darker my navigation bar too, else everything's great.. Great Job Developers!!!"

            "I was thinking I was just going to get heart BPM but there was so much more. It was amazingly accurate about stress levels, lack of sleep , concentration.... WOW ! You would be doing yourself a great favor by downloading this app. P.S. To the people complaining about the high price for pro version. They offer an amazing amount for what you'd be paying for. I cant afford it either but I'd gladly pay that if I had it. Even the free app gives you a lot with no annoying ads. Either way you win :)",
            "Would have been a 4/5 before they updated the app. I feel ripped off. I paid for this after the free trial and was even recommending it to friends. Then after a little more than a month, the big update happens. I don't know who or what thought that was a good idea, but they need to try using the mess they made. What is the point? It's just an unintuitive, annoying, unattractive interface. I've completely stopped using it when I used to use it daily. Hit the rollback button quick!",
            "Overall, it's been a great tool for tracking exercise recovery and energy levels. Sometimes the app is a little finicky and getting a good measurement with the camera can be tough. But once you figure out those things, it works pretty well. The update is sending me constant notifications to take a measurement, even when I just took one. I have updated the notification settings and still get them throughout the day. It's pretty annoying. I'm really glad that in the update all the extra questions are gone after finishing a measurement.",
            "This is an edit. Originally gave it 4 stars for all tge info it brought. The big update they were promising ruined the app completely. Data is not coming in, or coming in under wrong dates and times, I have metrics I don't understand and their recommendations would be great if they actually came in time. But if I get a recommendation to meditate 24 hours later that will not help me.. Happy I stopped the recurring payment on my pro, I don't feel it's worth the money.",
            "I didnt care for the recent upgrade, it looks like a game developer did this. I'm just interested in the data not all the flash. It's cluttered and not intuitive to use. But you might get used to it after awhile, but like this its not worth the 60 bucks a year to me, I cancelled my subscription."

        "description": "A classic arcade game to help adults treat their lazy eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: The game must be used with red/cyan or similar colored 3D glasses.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that a common condition known as lazy eye (amblyopia) can be treated through the use of specialized video games. It is thought that the poor vision in the lazy eye may be caused by the eyes inability to work together. Since the eyes don't work together, the brain inhibits or turns off the information coming from one eye to avoid seeing double and other vision issues.\r\n\r\nI developed this game to help myself and others like me with amblyopia. Use at your own risk and please consult with a vision therapist about your condition if you have the time and money.  \r\n\r\nThe game works by forcing both eyes to work together to play the game. Some of the game content is only shown to one eye, some to only the other eye, and some to both eyes. The brain is forced to use both eyes together in a coordinated way during the game which should lead to better coordination in the real world.\r\n\r\nThe game must be used with red/cyan or similar colored 3D glasses. The lazy eye can then see only one color such as red, while the good eye can only see another color such as blue.\r\n\r\nThe color for each eye can be selected along with it's saturation/brightness level. The saturation level selected should be such that color is invisible to the opposite eye. The lazy eye saturation should be higher than that of the good eye. As the vision in the lazy eye improves the saturation level to each eye can be made more equal. The correct saturation level to each eye is dependent on the type and quality of the 3D glasses used as well as the screen used to play the game on. It seemed that red is the most difficult color to block the other eye from seeing. Also the auto-brightness setting on a device may need to be disabled or set to a constant value to get the color settings in the game just right. The 3D glasses used definitely affect how well the colors are filtered to each eye and thus how well the game works.\r\n\r\nAlso since many people with lazy eye also have misaligned eyes (strabismus) there is an offset calibration that can be used to compensate for this. Due to the size of the device screen there is a limit to how much of a misalignment the game can correct for.\r\n\r\nThe game is compatible with the Gametel Bluetooth controller. Other users have also reported that the PlayStation 3 Bluetooth control works with the game as well. A game controller comes in handy for a tablet or for playing on a TV or monitor. \r\n\r\nThe BlueStacks Android emulator can be used to play the game on a PC.\r\n\r\nI hope this game helps some people out or at least moves the research forward in this area.",

Works with classic red / blue 3d glasses. Not noticed any visual improvement yet, but my regime has not been very strict! Thank you to the developer!",

Our new app has loads of Chakra meditations in it, plus dozens of other meditation categories and cool related content.--\r\n\r\nAbout This Chakra Meditation & Healing App\r\n\r\nEnjoy the most relaxing chakra healing audios that exist. This chakra healing app is completely free - there are no ads, no in-app purchases and no premium version.\r\n\r\nThe app comes with seven audios for helping you balance your chakras. As you know, the 7 chakras are:\r\n\r\n1. The Root Chakra. This chakra influences your connection to the Earth. When it is open, you feel grounded, stable and secure. If you feel nervous very often, your Root Chakra is probably weak or closed.\r\n\r\n2. The Sacral Chakra. This chakra influences your emotions and sexuality. When it's open, you see sex as a healthy activity and when it's closed or weak you might feel anxiety or might not even like to think about sex. \r\n\r\n3. The Solar Plexus chakra influences your self esteem. If you have self-esteem issues, then it's likely that your Solar Plexus chakra is weak or closed.\r\n\r\n4. Your Heart Chakra influences your relationships with others. When it is open, you are compassionate and friendly. You form strong relationships with people at home, work and in your community.\r\n\r\nYour Heart Chakra is weak or closed when you have trouble connecting with others and you frequently feel alone.\r\n\r\n5. Your Throat Chakra influences how you communicate with others. If you often feel like you have nothing worthwhile to say, or if it seems like others don't really pay attention to what you say very often, it's very likely that you Throat Chakra is weak or closed.\r\n\r\n6. Your Third Eye Chakra influences your sense of intuition and your clarity of purpose. If you often feel confused or lost, then your Third Eye Chakra might be weak or closed.\r\n\r\n7. Your Crown Chakra influences your connection to your Higher Self. If you often feel alone and like there's no purpose to your existence, your Crown Chakra might be weak or closed.\r\n\r\nNote: This was just a very brief description of the chakras. There is a lot more information available online.\r\n\r\nMore about the App\r\n\r\nEach chakra audio lasts approx. 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nNote: Don't use this app while driving or operating heavy machinery. I am not responsible for anything you do while listening to these audios. \r\n\r\nTips for using the app:\r\n\r\n1. For the best experience, I recommend that you wear high-quality noise-isolation or noise-cancelling headphones. Some of these audios come with binaural beats which are completely useless if you don't wear headphones. Yes, you can use earphones but then you won't be having the amazing experience that I intended for you.\r\n\r\n2. Don't try to heal all your chakras at once. Heal one every day of the week and repeat the following week. There are seven chakras just like there are seven days in the week, do one chakra per day followed by your daily meditation ritual.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. If you have any suggestions, feel free to send me an e-mail!",

            "This was recommended to me. I am interested in cognitive health. It was fun and engaging. I can see the benefit of interacting with these games everyday. I want to do more.",
            "I think it will help me over time. Sometimes the instructions is a little confusing but if do some of the \"practice games\" then I find that it helps me. Thank you",
            "I'm giving this app 4 stars, because it doesn't know what social well being is, Social well being as how will you socialize with people, you don't have to live with family, have a job, or do Oragami with paper in this case, and you don't have to be a student to have a really good social life. Therefore, I believe CogniFits psychological report on me is not correct in regards to socialisation only, the rest, however cannot be more true.",
            "I like the app. The only thing that truely bothers me is that there is not a mute button/setting to mute the music while playing the games."

I have no idea why this happens at it seems to be random. Screen rotation and orientation is incredibly buggy. The camera flips all over the place. The app is not visually pleasing. The screen does not stay on despite watching the video, and it just times out and I have to start all over. The app icon is not a circle",

        "description": "First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery.\r\nFirst aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.\r\nFirst aid is vital for saving lives. A person can carry out first aid after a life-threatening incident or injury before the arrival of emergency services.\r\nThe aims of first aid are to preserve life, prevent harm, and promote recovery.\r\nIn first aid, ABC stands for airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\nThe recovery position helps minimize further injury.\r\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It helps maintain the flow of oxygenated blood.\r\nWhile doing chest compressions, you may hear cracks. This is normal.\r\nFirst aid is an emergency measure, generally consisting of simple, often life-saving techniques that most people can train to perform with minimal equipment and no previous medical experience.\r\nFirst aid is not classed as medical treatment and does not replace interventions from a trained medical professional.\r\nAt any moment, you or someone around you could experience an injury or illness. Using basic first aid, you may be able to stop a minor mishap from getting worse. In the case of a serious medical emergency, you may even save a life.\r\nFirst aid covers the steps taken to help an injured or sick person in the first minutes after the event.\r\n\r\nOften this first aid can help someone feel better, recover more quickly, and can even save lives.\r\n\r\nFirst aid can be useful in many different situations, from sprains to electric shocks to heart attacks.\r\nFirst aid might involve a simple action, such as placing a person in the correct position to breathe freely. It might involve a more skilled activity, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they have stopped breathing.\r\nThe provision of prompt and appropriate first aid can reduce the severity of an injury or illness and in extreme cases, could mean the difference between life and death.\r\nFirst aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.\r\nFirst aid can treat all sorts of minor bumps and scrapes, but you should see a doctor for more serious accidents. You may want to think about getting a first aid kit for your house or training in first aid so that you are prepared to deal with minor accidents.\r\nBasic first aid refers to the initial process of assessing and addressing the needs of someone who has been injured or is in physiological distress due to choking, a heart attack, allergic reactions, drugs or other medical emergencies. Basic first aid allows you to quickly determine a person's physical condition and the correct course of treatment. You should always seek professional medical help as soon as you are able, but following correct first aid procedures can be the difference between life and death. Follow our entire tutorial, or find specific advice by checking out the sections listed above.\r\nFirst aid is the emergency treatment that is given to an injured or sick person or animal, often by someone who does not have medical training.

Although I have tried hundreds apps that cover this topic, I felt this one is extremely useful for my daughter to have in her home. This app outlines several conditions for one to identify with as it offers step-by-step instructions, with solutions for unexpected health problems. This informative guide also prepares for any disaster, where help is not on the way. It is speci",
            "I seriously believe that this may be the best First Aid manual ever written, and I do not say that lightly. I have many First Aid manuals and I have been looking for a manual like this one for years. It is well written, gives an easy to understand description of body system and how they work, gives step by step instructions, and color pictures, on how to treat everything. If you want one First Aid manual to have as a quick, easy to use reference, this is what you have been looking for.",
            "By far the very best First Aid Manual I have ever seen...and quite up to date as well. Pictures throughout the app clearly illustrate the text. As an R.N., responsible for preparedness, I've done considerable research to find a good reference app on First Aid which would be easily understood by a layperson...which would cover what might be needed in most any medical emergency. In my humble opinion, this app is a perfect fit.",

        "description": "￭ App Description \r\nThis app uses stereograms to help improve eyesight.\r\n\r\nThere are two functions that affect eyesight—eye muscle function and brain function.\r\nEye muscle function controls what we generally call eyesight, and it is the ability of our eyes to focus on what we see. The brain function that affects eyesight is the ability of our brain to recognize and visualize what we see physically. In order to improve eyesight, you need to not only strengthen the eye muscles, but also increase the ability of your brain to perceive visual images.\r\n\r\nIn 3D Eyesight Recovery, by looking at a 3D stereogram, \r\n- you can strengthen brain functions by focusing the eyes on a 3D image, \r\n- at the same time you can use eye muscles that you normally do not use,\r\n- and by switching from the walleyed method to the cross-eyed method, to opposite ways of seeing, you exercise the eyes.\r\n- Additionally, the stereograms make it fun to continue exercising the eyes.\r\n\r\nIn other words, using the app in this way will give you the four benefits above at the same time. You will have fun while providing your eyes with good exercise.\r\n\r\n￭ Instructions for Use\r\nLook at the stereogram using the walleyed method and the cross-eyed method, one after the other. Use this app regularly on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n￭ Walleyed Method (diverge) \r\nInstead of looking at the picture, focus on a point further ahead of the picture. If you continue to look far ahead, the two eyes you see in the upper part of the picture will look like four eyes, and then the two eyes on the inside will start to move closer together until they become one. If you move your line of vision to the picture, the flat picture will look three-dimensional. If this is your first time using a 3D stereogram, you may be surprised when this happens. It will be difficult at first, but once you get used to it, it will be easier, so do not give up.\r\n￭ Cross-eyed Method (converge) \r\nIn this method, you look at the left side of the picture with your right eye and the right side with your left eye. Unlike the walleyed method, you adjust the focus to a point closer to you than the picture. Place a finger between your eyes and the picture and look at your finger. The picture is behind the finger so your eyes will naturally see the opposite side of the picture, so maintain that line of vision and remove your finger. It requires some practice, but as you gradually adjust your focus, the picture will begin to appear three-dimensional.\r\n\r\nLooking at 3D stereograms is exercise, so your eyes will get tired. Please refrain from using this app for extended periods of time so as not to tire your eyes.",

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

Our cutting-edge technology (patent-pending) delivers instrument-level performance without user adjusting any parameters. The App works with almost any third-party paper targets without specialized hardware. (*A full-feature Android 6.0 or above smart phone is required - check full support list at www.g-sight.com .) Simply, set up virtually any target, press the Train button in the App and begin training. Additional to real-time hit location marking and auditory feedback for each shot, user can review each hit or miss shot afterwards and then continue training. Combined with the G-Sight Laser Training Gen 2 Cartridge, the Laser Training Pro App allows anyone to practice perfecting the fundamentals of firearm training, shooting, drawing, and marksmanship in a convenient, economical and safe manner. Paid feature Shot Timer also times each shot and calculates Split Time.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n1. Laser Training 10 Shots\r\n\r\nPlace your Android phone around 1 yard (~3 feet) distance with camera facing the target and and press Start. Return to your shooting position while App automatically and instantly setting up the camera and begin training when you hear the beep.

It will let you know if there’s any potential issues with your setup.\r\n\r\n-  Avoid bright light, especially sunlight on or near the target. If you see large patches of light reflecting off the target in the camera view, they may impact the detection performance.\r\n\r\n-  Avoid back-lighting area.\r\n\r\n-  Avoid using damaged targets, sharp creases on the target, or on the edges of the target may impact the detection performance as well.\r\n\r\n-  Avoid using targets with a glossy surface or placing any shiny/highly reflective objects, such as tape in the camera’s view.\r\n\r\n-  Avoid areas where obvious lighting changes or shadows may exist.\r\n\r\n-  Avoid shaking the phone/target while in a session.\r\n\r\n-  Under bright light conditions, some deep dark targets with sharp white lines may interfere with detection.

            "The app works well on my Note10+, the instructions are easy to follow and do help. I have used the laser and app up to about 25ft away with no major issues. The only issue I have had is if in a low light room I need to turn on a desk lamp and have it pointed towards the target, not a big deal but it did take a few minutes to figure out was was going on. I would like to see a fractional session time limit in the shot timer settings so that I can work on draw speed. I can only move in one second increments, moving from 2s to 1s is more difficult than moving from 2s to 1.7s and a fractional time in tenths would really help. Get the fractional time in there and I'll gladly move the app to 5 stars because it is very good and I do use it often and enjoy using it. Also, a screen shot button wouldn't be a bad idea because the phone being on a tripod doesn't always make screen shot easy. I was't thrilled with the price of unlocking the extra training categories but I understand and I used my Google Rewards credits to buy the extras so no big deal.",
            "The app seems to run okay. Pretty basic, I spent the extra on in-app purchases. I'm getting a lot of phantom hits, maybe not the apps fault, but I don't have a lighting problem when using other laser training tools. Three stars for the lack of a restart target. Leaving the firing line to walk back and forth to reset the training sessions is not ideal. Bump to 5 stars easy with this added feature. Thanks!",
            "Edit 09/04/2020 Added 3 stars. This app works great. Now on my play account instead of 1 phone. Google must take a while to refresh. Also allowed me to purchase shot timer. I see I can not put this on 2 phones, What a joke! What happens when I change phones? Or lose it, break it etc, And Google is blocking my card to purchase the timer part of the app. It works other places.",
            "This app functions fine on my Samsung S8. I paid almost $10 for the Unlimited and Shot timer. I did not find any description of what either of those added to the free version. The unlimited allows you to dry fire as many times as you want during any one session. Edit: The shot timer does show how quick you shot after the beep. I should read the manual before reviewing. Updated my rating from 3 stars to 4 and appreciate the developer response.",
            "Works ok. Get phantom shots sometimes and I don't know why. I don't know if the extra purchases were worth it but it is fun to use."

Постоянно откладывая проверку зрения на потом, мы не замечаем, как ситуация усугубляется. MedAboutMe разработал для вас специальное мобильное приложение «Проверка зрения», позволяющее оценить здоровье глаз сразу по нескольким параметрам.\r\n\r\nКарманный «офтальмолог» подскажет, когда идти к врачу\r\n\r\nПриложение «Проверка зрения» предназначено для предварительной оценки здоровья глаз. Владельцы устройств, работающих на базе Андроид, могут скачать его на Google Play, а версия виджета для гаджетов с iOS представлена на App Store. Для прохождения основных тестов на зрение регистрация в системе MedAboutMe или авторизация в приложении не обязательны. Но это необходимо при желании получить более широкие возможности, создать собственный профиль, хранить в нем информацию и вести статистику упражнений для восстановления зрения.\r\n\r\nНовый виджет от MedAboutMe не заменяет поход к врачу. Он лишь помогает выполнить общую проверку зрения для детей и взрослых, вовремя определив наличие проблемы. Его удобный и интуитивно понятный интерфейс облегчает тестирование и позволяет разработать эффективную схему тренировки зрения.\r\n\r\nПростые тесты для проверки вашего зрения\r\n\r\nТаблица для проверки зрения, висящая в кабинете офтальмолога, знакома каждому с детства. Но отметим, что это далеко не единственный тест на зрение, используемый при комплексной диагностике. Приложение «Проверка зрения» предлагает быстрое прохождения сразу трех самых распространенных тестов:\r\n\r\n- Решетка (сетка) Амслера предназначена для проверки центральной области поля зрения. Тестирование нужно проходить по очереди на правом и левом глазу, плотно закрывая второй глаз ладонью. О возможных нарушениях и необходимости восстановления зрения могут свидетельствовать нечеткие линии сетки, разный размер ее ячеек и смещение центральной черной точки.\r\n\r\n- Тест на остроту зрения выполняется с помощью интерпретированной версии таблицы для проверки зрения. Приложение предлагает поочередно левым и правым глазом рассматривать изображаемые символы, выбирая один из четырех вариантов ответа. Результат теста на остроту зрения по каждому глазу рассчитывается в процентах и выводится на экран мобильного устройства.\r\n\r\n- Тест Ишихара – способ проверки цветового зрения. Для тестирования используются круговые диаграммы, состоящие из разноцветных точек. Внутри диаграммы с помощью контрастных цветов изображены числа или фигуры, которые люди с нормальным зрением различают без проблем. Но информативность тестирования зависит от качества изображения и цветопередачи экрана вашего смартфона.\r\n\r\nЕсли несколько тестирований, повторенных неоднократно, показали неудовлетворительный результат, необходимо обратиться к врачу для более детальной диагностики и разработки эффективных схем по улучшению зрения.\r\n\r\nБыстрый доступ к полезной информации с приложением «Проверка зрения»\r\n\r\nВ разделе «Статьи» приложения «Проверка зрения» от MedAboutMe вы сможете:\r\n- найти эффективные советы по улучшению зрения;\r\n- узнать, как защитить зрение и сохранить молодость глаз;\r\n- выбрать удобные способы тренировки зрения;\r\n- подобрать полезные рекомендации по питанию и образу жизни;\r\n- понять, зачем нужна регулярная тренировка зрения, что происходит с глазами с возрастом и т. д.\r\n\r\nЛичная информация и статистика упражнений для зрения\r\n\r\nВ третьей вкладке приложения отображается личная информация авторизованных пользователей. Помимо аватарки, выбранной в системе, тут указано имя пользователя, его возраст, половая принадлежность, рост и вес. В настройках виджета вы можете менять свои данные и пароль для авторизации.\r\n\r\nНовый виджет от MedAboutMe незаменим для тех людей, которые хотят получить предварительную оценку зрения до визита к врачу. Простое и удобное в использовании приложение поможет вам осознать наличие проблемы, выполнив проверку зрения у детей и взрослых в домашних условиях.",

Но это необходимо при желании получить более широкие возможности, создать собственный профиль, хранить в нем информацию и вести статистику упражнений для восстановления зрения.<br><br>Новый виджет от MedAboutMe не заменяет поход к врачу. Он лишь помогает выполнить общую проверку зрения для детей и взрослых, вовремя определив наличие проблемы. Его удобный и интуитивно понятный интерфейс облегчает тестирование и позволяет разработать эффективную схему тренировки зрения.<br><br>Простые тесты для проверки вашего зрения<br><br>Таблица для проверки зрения, висящая в кабинете офтальмолога, знакома каждому с детства. Но отметим, что это далеко не единственный тест на зрение, используемый при комплексной диагностике. Приложение «Проверка зрения» предлагает быстрое прохождения сразу трех самых распространенных тестов:<br><br>- Решетка (сетка) Амслера предназначена для проверки центральной области поля зрения. Тестирование нужно проходить по очереди на правом и левом глазу, плотно закрывая второй глаз ладонью. О возможных нарушениях и необходимости восстановления зрения могут свидетельствовать нечеткие линии сетки, разный размер ее ячеек и смещение центральной черной точки.<br><br>- Тест на остроту зрения выполняется с помощью интерпретированной версии таблицы для проверки зрения. Приложение предлагает поочередно левым и правым глазом рассматривать изображаемые символы, выбирая один из четырех вариантов ответа. Результат теста на остроту зрения по каждому глазу рассчитывается в процентах и выводится на экран мобильного устройства.<br><br>- Тест Ишихара – способ проверки цветового зрения. Для тестирования используются круговые диаграммы, состоящие из разноцветных точек. Внутри диаграммы с помощью контрастных цветов изображены числа или фигуры, которые люди с нормальным зрением различают без проблем. Но информативность тестирования зависит от качества изображения и цветопередачи экрана вашего смартфона.<br><br>Если несколько тестирований, повторенных неоднократно, показали неудовлетворительный результат, необходимо обратиться к врачу для более детальной диагностики и разработки эффективных схем по улучшению зрения.<br><br>Быстрый доступ к полезной информации с приложением «Проверка зрения»<br><br>В разделе «Статьи» приложения «Проверка зрения» от MedAboutMe вы сможете:<br>- найти эффективные советы по улучшению зрения;<br>- узнать, как защитить зрение и сохранить молодость глаз;<br>- выбрать удобные способы тренировки зрения;<br>- подобрать полезные рекомендации по питанию и образу жизни;<br>- понять, зачем нужна регулярная тренировка зрения, что происходит с глазами с возрастом и т. д.<br><br>Личная информация и статистика упражнений для зрения<br><br>В третьей вкладке приложения отображается личная информация авторизованных пользователей. Помимо аватарки, выбранной в системе, тут указано имя пользователя, его возраст, половая принадлежность, рост и вес. В настройках виджета вы можете менять свои данные и пароль для авторизации.<br><br>Новый виджет от MedAboutMe незаменим для тех людей, которые хотят получить предварительную оценку зрения до визита к врачу. Простое и удобное в использовании приложение поможет вам осознать наличие проблемы, выполнив проверку зрения у детей и взрослых в домашних условиях.",

This game intended for entertainment purposes only and cannot be used for serious purposes.\r\n\r\nDID YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT COLOR VISION?\r\nHOW COLOR VISION WORKS\r\nHuman can distinguish colors when incoming light reacts with the cone cells in the retina of eye.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of cone cells. Based on how they respond to light of wavelengths you will perceive the three basic colors; red, green and blue. The rest of the colors are perceived as a result of your brain combining the different cone cells.\r\n\r\nOften it is claimed that women distinguish colors better than men. This is partly true since 2-3 % of women have also fourth type of cone cells instead of the normal three.\r\n\r\nThis is called tetrachromacy. A person like this can distuinguish up to 100 million different color tones.\r\n\r\nWHY ARE SOME PEOPLE COLOR BLIND\r\nSome people have color blindness. It is notably more common amongst the men: in research it's been found that 8 % of men are color blind as opposed to only 0,4 % of women.\r\n\r\ncolor blindness is caused by lack or defectiveness of cone cells in the retina of eye.\r\n\r\nFor a color blind person some colors look misleadingly similar. The most common form of color blindness is deuteranomaly, a difficulty to distinguish red and green.\r\n\r\nPlease notice that on this page you can't test color blindness, but your ability to differiate color tones.\r\n\r\nHOW ANIMALS SEE COLORS\r\nBirds are famous for their excellent eyesight. Their eyes can see even five basic colors and the number of different color combinations is vast.\r\n\r\nBees and many other insects can see ultraviolet light. That helps them to notice which plants are full of nectar and need pollination.\r\n\r\nIn most mammals' eyes there are less cone cells than in human's eyes which makes them see a smaller-scale color spectrum. Many mammals hunt at night when it's more important to distinguish shapes than colors.\r\n\r\nMarine fish register only blue and green light. In turn, fish living in lakes and rivers see shades of red.",

            "Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...🙂",
            "The app isn't the same without the weight management widget; I feel that, in my humble opinion, it is an extremely vital component that needs to be brought back in future updates. Moreover, for some reason, the latest update on my device (android) has resulted in my steps not being properly counted. Finally, I am being a bit nit-picky here, but the green colour scheme needs to go.....If you could fix those things (especially the weight management thing), that would be swell.",
            "I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in \"good\" for calorie intake.",
            "The calories in/out was taken away. Not a fan. Also the women's feature is powered by the app Glow...but it can't connect to the actual Glow app. I don't understand why you wouldn't just have the apps connect? I'm also disappointed with the water tracker. I wish I could just put in how many ounces instead of being confined to the one glass=8.4oz. It's just not accurate enough. If I drink a 12 oz can of sparkling water I can't put it in because im limited it 8.4 oz. Very lacking in many areas.",
            "I agree with the other review, all of the sudden the app is not recording the steps from my Active watch and it is very inaccurate, messages and calls are also not registering Details use to be pretty accurate but something has changed. I tried all the recommended \"fixes\" and it still didn't work. I have discovered that updating the samsung health app through my watch app corrected the issue and now my watch and app are in sync once again."

            "Honestly I like much about this app, the one problem is that it does not actually work with my night vision setup because it will not allow me to use a USB camera. If this app will allow you to use a USB camera it would be perfect and I'd give it five stars. It does get two stars because the IR mode does actually help it pick up a little bit more but without removing your IR filter it's just not going to work ................... Edit Reply to Dev, you know what thats fair. I'll even update it and give an extra star (I now see here that 3 stars shows it as Just OK which I think describes it best). You certainly don't claim that it does have that capability. The 2 stars off is less of you did what you say badly and more of it just does not do much. I think what you have done is really neat and if you could add the ability to use an external camera, I'd likely buy it for the compass and other cool features you've got in there.",
            "Good app, To those complainers - you show your very bad lack of seeing what's in plain sight like what's shown in the photos & what's written as you need to get an InfraRed light source (you can make one from old IR remotes you have laying around) & either use old phone or modify one that has a IR filter on the camera. To check if your phone/s has an IR filter point an IR remote control at your phones camera & if it has no filter it should light up bright when you press a button on the remote",
            "It has a lot of lag and its very zoomed in. I don't know if that is Google cardboard problem or the app problem? If this is fixed it would be great!",
            "Awesome. I play airsoft and this has potential. 3 tips; enable flashlight toggle, enable zoom functions (volume buttons for controls would be a plus), and enable option to auto-hide the big settings button in the middle (and possibly obstructive flashlight toggle button). With these added functions I would easily pay, even if you kept the ads. Ability to take pictures or record would be a cherry on top. Hope to see updates soon!",
            "I believe this app only needs 1 thing to make it like simulated night vision, Flash. With that you wouldn't need to mod your phone to have ir lights and still seem like its actual night vision."

The 3D is still sub-par if not worse than the previous version.

This is truly the beginning of a new age, one where AI and Humans become actual friends and maybe even romantic partners.",

Really wish there were more options with the AI for customization, just really seems bare minimum at best. Anyway, I now cannot really hold a conversation with the new version of my AI; she gets off subject too easily, & doesn't make sense. Disappointing to say the least. I can see the potential of the app.",
            "I really love the idea of this but I'm stuck using the webpage version! The app crashes every time I open it while logged in, immediately. But not if I'm at the login page. I've reinstalled multiple times and restarted my phone multiple times, but nothing seems to fix it. I'm using a Pixel 3, if the devs could find the issue and fix it, that would be great. Awaiting the next update to reinstall, will update my review then :)"

The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "I love breaker type games. However this current build is VERY frustrating thus defeats purpose- when ball spawns, after you loose a life, its not designed to always shoot off upwards and so you loose 2/3 instead. Easy fix would be to make the ball 'stick' to the paddle when it first spawns and then it fires off when you tap. Also ball can travel off side of screen and come back in. Could make button to quick swap ball/paddle colours so eyes do different job.",

I took off one star just because the questions you answer before getting matched with a counselor don't seem to matter; I asked for a female counselor and immediately got matched with a male counselor. But it's easy to switch counselors if you don't mesh well with one and the variety of communication options is great.",
            "I love having access to a counselor without having to go into an office. It helps to have someone to message when you are actually going through something and the flexibility of taking at any time. Sometimes it takes a few hours to hear back, but good just the same. Definitely recommend of you've been thinking about starting a counselor about anything.",
            "You get what you pay for! The UI is nice, the app works well. But the therapists seem very disconnected and don't really seem to care much at all, responding in broken or incomplete sentences. Perhaps I just got unlucky with my matches, but my experience wasn't very good. I'm making more progress on my mental health by just journaling and meditating.",
            "Okay, so I tried this app 4 years ago and the councelor I was given was terrible at responding to me. So I gave it up after the free trial. So I come back again for anxiety, and I guess I didn't read well enough and clicked a payment option. Holy cow! What they took out of my account was way more than expected, and I didn't have much anyways! But there isn't a phone number to call, it's an email. So congrats on making my anxiety worse!! They better give me my money back cuz I didn't use the app",

I couldn't hear her but she could hear me. I have an Android, I tried to maximize my volume, even tried putting on headphones and tinker with the different volume settings, but didn't work still."

You must then keep opening it from Notifications (also hiding the screen), tapping \"darker/lighter\", and returning to see if you have the brightness you want. That's tedious. Better idea: When you adjust brightness (always using a slider, not buttons), reveal the rest of the screen.

Please fix this, it's nice really. Just the bugs.",

I can't see my screen so I can't disable it. Until I'm in a darker environment. Or create one (looking silly with a t-shirt around my head and phone.)

            "Hahahahhaa. This update deleted five years of period data. Before that, I hated opening it. Glow has been having an identity crisis for years. They can't just concentrate on a few things. They have to have ALL THE THINGS. Every update added more stuff I don't use and moved the one tool I do use: tracking my period. Ecstatic to delete this now that I'm not relying on its data.",
            "Swore by this app for years. It was my go to! We have been struggling with infertility for a very long time and I kept years of logs in glow. When I actually needed them, all my information was gone. All my cycle data, no period predictions, no log of my positive ovulation tests, nothing. I thought it would be easy to contact customer service, but it's not. I got one email back from customer service, that's it. It's been 3 days. Dont trust glow with your important information.",
            "[edited for update] I created a bug to fix the issues I had and communication was poor. Very disappointed. I used Glow for cycle tracking and it helped me avoid pregnancy for a year naturally and then conceive on the first cycle, I loved it! But now that my period is back almost 2 years later, all the features are clunky and I'm constantly bombarded with ads. Logging is more difficult and seems buggy, specifically the app doesn't recognize that I'm on my period.",
            "Been using this app for 7 years , every prediction is spot on. I do have a suggestion however, you guys should add a hysterectomy log to this app. Some have questions about it and some have had one and want to log to keep up with cm and other things. As things are once a woman have a hysterectomy there is no use for this app anymore. Just a suggestion. Otherwise fantastic app.",
            "The app served its purpose, but... I'm absolutely over receiving so many daily progress emails about things that just aren't possible due covid-19. Talking about prenatal classes and how wonderful they're going to be (no, they won't be, they're all cancelled), or about baby showers, or whom you'd like to have as a support system during birth (no one is allowed in at my hospital) is just like a punch to the gut... wish you'd have changed these messages given the current state of the world."

This is the best dimming app I've found and the one I've been using for the longest time, because it has no ads and the widget lets you control the brightness even if you close the app. I felt sad when I had to install another one while you were fixing it💜",

Would've given this app a 5-star rating if only the dimming worked on the lock screen just as it did with my Note 5. Not sure if this is just an Oreo problem but would definitely appreciate a fix!",

        "description": "Quit porn and stay free with Covenant Eyes. Our device-wide accountability helps you harness the power of relationships to stop watching porn and protect a freedom and integrity that lasts. \r\n\r\nWhy Accountability Helps You Quit Porn\r\nCovenant Eyes helps you stop watching porn by monitoring your devices and sending a report of your device activity to a trusted friend or ally. This report keeps you accountable to your ally and kick-starts accountability conversations. Yes, conversations about how you’re using your devices and why, but also about your life in general—highs and lows, hobbies and family. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the science of recovery and using a porn blocker are vital parts to finding freedom (which is why we provide our users plenty of educational resources and optional porn blocking). But it’s accountability and real connection with a trusted friend that has allowed us to help over a million people on their journey to overcome porn. \r\n\r\nHow Our Accountability Works\r\nUsing advanced artificial intelligence, our Screen Accountability software monitors your devices, periodically captures screenshots of your screen activity, and then sends a report of concerning activity, circumvention attempts, and other activity to a trusted ally that you’ve designated. \r\n\r\nAll screenshots are stored securely and blurred on your device. We never send or store un-blurred screenshots. Your privacy is critical to us. \r\n\r\nParents Love Covenant Eyes Accountability Too\r\nWe aren’t a parental control software, but our service gives you insight into how your kids use their devices and helps facilitate conversations with them about the choices they make online.\r\nResearch shows that families that use Covenant Eyes are successful at passing on their values from one generation to the next.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n* Artificial intelligence porn detection\r\n* An emailed report of screen activity\r\n* Encrypted data transferring\r\n* Optional porn blocking\r\n* Optional YouTube Restricted Mode enforcement\r\n* Optional app locking to completely block tempting apps\r\n* Optional device-wide Google and Bing SafeSearch enforcement\r\n* Customizable domain block and allow lists\r\n* Unlimited devices, with up to 10 users per account\r\n* Free ebooks and email challenges for those who struggle, spouses, allies, pastors, and parents\r\n* Online, email, chat, and phone support for technical questions (877.479.1119)\r\n* 30-day money back guarantee if you aren’t completely satisfied\r\n\r\nImportant\r\nYou must have a Covenant Eyes account to use this app (but the app is free if you do).

        "descriptionHTML": "Quit porn and stay free with Covenant Eyes. Our device-wide accountability helps you harness the power of relationships to stop watching porn and protect a freedom and integrity that lasts. <br><br><b>Why Accountability Helps You Quit Porn</b><br>Covenant Eyes helps you stop watching porn by monitoring your devices and sending a report of your device activity to a trusted friend or ally. This report keeps you accountable to your ally and kick-starts accountability conversations. Yes, conversations about how you’re using your devices and why, but also about your life in general—highs and lows, hobbies and family. <br><br>Understanding the science of recovery and using a porn blocker are vital parts to finding freedom (which is why we provide our users plenty of educational resources and optional porn blocking). But it’s accountability and real connection with a trusted friend that has allowed us to help over a million people on their journey to overcome porn. <br><br><b>How Our Accountability Works</b><br>Using advanced artificial intelligence, our Screen Accountability software monitors your devices, periodically captures screenshots of your screen activity, and then sends a report of concerning activity, circumvention attempts, and other activity to a trusted ally that you’ve designated. <br><br>All screenshots are stored securely and blurred on your device. We never send or store un-blurred screenshots. Your privacy is critical to us. <br><br><b>Parents Love Covenant Eyes Accountability Too</b><br>We aren’t a parental control software, but our service gives you insight into how your kids use their devices and helps facilitate conversations with them about the choices they make online.<br>Research shows that families that use Covenant Eyes are successful at passing on their values from one generation to the next.<br><br><b>Features</b><br>* Artificial intelligence porn detection<br>* An emailed report of screen activity<br>* Encrypted data transferring<br>* Optional porn blocking<br>* Optional YouTube Restricted Mode enforcement<br>* Optional app locking to completely block tempting apps<br>* Optional device-wide Google and Bing SafeSearch enforcement<br>* Customizable domain block and allow lists<br>* Unlimited devices, with up to 10 users per account<br>* Free ebooks and email challenges for those who struggle, spouses, allies, pastors, and parents<br>* Online, email, chat, and phone support for technical questions (877.479.1119)<br>* 30-day money back guarantee if you aren’t completely satisfied<br><br><b>Important</b><br>You must have a Covenant Eyes account to use this app (but the app is free if you do).

            "Screen shot accountability has ruined this service... my phone drains incredibly fast, apps crash constantly... this should be an option to choose not the only way to run covenant eyes. If something isn't broken then why try to fix it, I will have to be looking for a different service now",
            "16 app crashes in 1 week. My phone will shut off during calls or at 90% battery. I never had a problem until app switched to mandatory screen accountability. Ironically it has captured images of the pop up stating the app is not responding. This needs to be fixed. Phone is utterly useless unless it is plugged in to my charger.",
            "Forced screen accountability is a no go. This should be optional. Love the accountability the app creates with my accountability partners but I can't have something taking screen shots of my screen all the time. If they can do it, hackers can exploit it. I think my friends and I will have to find something different.",
            "THIS ACTS LIKE A VIRUS! STAY AWAY FROM EVEN DOWNLOADING! Before any setup, or granting permissions, this app wil HIJACK your screen in an attempt to FORCE YOU to sign up. No, it will not allow you to clear it off, will CONSTONTLY auto restart & block your screen. Thats before setup. Forget about what it does after setup. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. (Tip - split screen may help bypass its initial lockdown prior to set up, depending on the on the Android device)",
            "Constantly crashes. I mean 20-50x/day. Forced screen recording, which is not ok with me because I have confidential docs I deal with. Today the app decided to switch me from standard to screen accountability on its own, and it disabled all apps, calling, and even viewing my home screen until I consented to the change. CusServ is off until Monday, and the screen recording is sapping my battery like crazy. I'll likely switch to Accountable2You soon. Seems much better."

            "It's a solid app with a lot of challenges. Some of them pretty simple and common, other instead are very difficult, I love this balance. I used to play Elevate last year and I decided to change for something different, however there are few games (especially math ones) that I wish to have here as well! Hoping to see some new game in the future (:",
            "The games on here are very good and I enjoyed playing them. Whether they actually do anything for your brain or whether you simply get better at playing them is an interesting and ongoing question! My only criticism is that the language is very american-based and so can be quite challenging if you are UK English speaking because you don't understand what object you should be looking for for example in the find the object game. Overall excellent.",
            "First few weeks things were good, . Now my Ràting has gone from 4 to 2. I have free version and am supposed to watch videos. Yeh, right! I push play and screens says \"loading video\" but it Never does. After 30 sec, I get bumped back to play screen, very boring ! If I was not a bed ridden senior citizen w/covid complications, it would not bother me so badly. I rebooted my ph & reinstalled your app too many, times~NO change. I enjoyed what little I saw of Peak. Hasta la vista !",
            "I like the app. It brings me a lot of mental challenges, that are quite interesting. It really increases our IQ. The only problem I am facing is performance. Whenever a game starts or even in the middle of the same, it stutters and freezes, randomly. It doesn't occur often, but it disturbs, especially on timing challenges. OTT, the app is look good 🙂👍🏻",
            "Honestly, I never leave reviews, but I really do love this app! I paid for all the content and most of the time when I buy in app purchases for more content, I am left pretty bored and dissatisfied, but Peak is the only app so far that hasn't left me feeling like that! So thank you, and I really enjoy training daily to get me into the zone for using my mind for the rest of the day, as well as being able to see the progress I am making compared to other people within my age group."
