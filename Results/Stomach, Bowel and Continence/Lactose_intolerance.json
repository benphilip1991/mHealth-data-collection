            "I was so excited when I found this app. Then was super disappointed once I started/ tried to use it. I just had a blood test recently that listed 17 foods that I am sensitive to, eggs, cheese, pineapple, rice as well as gluten just to name a few. I was sad that I couldn't add anything but gluten to my allergies list on this app. Thus making this app useless for me. 🙍😔",
            "this app has great potential but it needs work on its user interface, navigation and food variety. I wish that in addition to gluten and histamine I could add other things like cow's milk (A1 dairy) and maybe a few other things like cashews, Brazil nuts, ginger... but definitely pleasantly surprised to see detailed information on certain amino acids, etc. hopefully it is correct",
            "Lactose free food search, there is a quite a good spread of foods in the database. There are some foods not covered by this app",
            "Limited food selection. For example, acorn squash not listed. Grey color coding not explained. Would not use as definitive guide. Last updated over 2 years ago.",

        "description": "Lactose Intolerence is a condition a person has when their body cannot correctly process lactose. Lactose is a milk sugar that is often found in foods made from milk products, such as yoghurt, ice cream and other dairy foods.\r\n\r\nWhen a lactose intolerent person consumes a product containing lactose, their body cannot process the food and this can result in unpleasant symptoms, which commonly include stomach cramping, diarrhea, and flatulence. Depending on the amount of dairy the person consumes and to what degree their body can process lactose, will determine their degree of adverse reaction.\r\n\r\nThe medical explanation of lactose intolerence is fairly straightforward when lactose and lactase are distinguished. Lactose is milk sugar found in milk products and lactase are the enzymes that aid in digesting lactose. Lactase enzymes can be found on the wall lining of the small intestine. They aid in digesting and absorbing lactose into the body. If lactose cannot be broken down into Glucose, it will sit and ferment in the body creating excess amounts of methane/ hydrogen and water. With these excess amounts in the small intestine, it creates the common lactose intolerent symptoms that include flatulence, stomach cramps, and diarrhea.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 main causes to why people experience lactose intolerent symptoms. These include congenital, secondary and developmental causes. Congenital (after birth) is caused by a rare condition that involves a mutation of the gene that produces lactase. Lactose intolerent symptoms usually begin to appear soon after birth. The secondary cause of lactose intolerence is the lack of lactase in the small intestine, due wall lining damage by a disease or illness. The third and last cause of lactose intolerent symptoms is called developmental or hypolactasia. This is when the decrease of lactase in the body occurs over time due to the programming of an individual's DNA. The time the decreation begins, the age of first symptoms, can vary throughout different ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nThe most common symptoms of lactose intolerence include diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. The uncommon lactose intolerent symptoms are abdominal bloating, nausea and abdominal distention. The severity of these symptoms is dependent on the amount of lactose consumed and how much lactose the body can tolerate.\r\n\r\nThere are several tests that can determine and distinguish whether a person has lactose intolerence, a milk allergy or a lactase deficiency. These tests include the milk test, elimination diet, breath test, intestinal biopsy, stool acidity test and the blood glucose test. If a person suspects they have this condition after experiencing lactose intolerent symptoms, the first thing they should do is make sure they have spoken with their doctor before beginning any sort of lactose free diet. Because lactose intolerence is a well-known medical condition, there are many people that just assume that if they suffer from lactose intolerent symptoms that they have lactose intolerence. This person may actually have another underlying reason for the cause of their symptoms that should be treated. When a person assumes they have lactose intolerence and cut all milk products from their diet, they may not be aware that they need to take supplements to replace the calcium they once received from the milk products. This can result in severe long-term effects.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide variety of ways to control lactose intolerent symptoms in a person's life. These include diet changes, supplements, lactase tablets, and adaptation to lactose. When a person makes a significant change in their diet such as cutting out foods containing lactose, there is a need to check with your doctor to ensure that you can take a substitute to ensure there is plenty of calcium and Vitamin D in your diet. Vitamin D deficiency can result in bone weakness in adults and bone deformity in children.",

        "description": "Lactose Intolerence is a condition a person has when their body cannot correctly process lactose. Lactose is a milk sugar that is often found in foods made from milk products, such as yoghurt, ice cream and other dairy foods.\r\n\r\nWhen a lactose intolerent person consumes a product containing lactose, their body cannot process the food and this can result in unpleasant symptoms, which commonly include stomach cramping, diarrhea, and flatulence. Depending on the amount of dairy the person consumes and to what degree their body can process lactose, will determine their degree of adverse reaction.\r\n\r\nThe medical explanation of lactose intolerence is fairly straightforward when lactose and lactase are distinguished. Lactose is milk sugar found in milk products and lactase are the enzymes that aid in digesting lactose. Lactase enzymes can be found on the wall lining of the small intestine. They aid in digesting and absorbing lactose into the body. If lactose cannot be broken down into Glucose, it will sit and ferment in the body creating excess amounts of methane/ hydrogen and water. With these excess amounts in the small intestine, it creates the common lactose intolerent symptoms that include flatulence, stomach cramps, and diarrhea.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 main causes to why people experience lactose intolerent symptoms. These include congenital, secondary and developmental causes. Congenital (after birth) is caused by a rare condition that involves a mutation of the gene that produces lactase. Lactose intolerent symptoms usually begin to appear soon after birth. The secondary cause of lactose intolerence is the lack of lactase in the small intestine, due wall lining damage by a disease or illness. The third and last cause of lactose intolerent symptoms is called developmental or hypolactasia. This is when the decrease of lactase in the body occurs over time due to the programming of an individual's DNA. The time the decreation begins, the age of first symptoms, can vary throughout different ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nThe most common symptoms of lactose intolerence include diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. The uncommon lactose intolerent symptoms are abdominal bloating, nausea and abdominal distention. The severity of these symptoms is dependent on the amount of lactose consumed and how much lactose the body can tolerate.\r\n\r\nThere are several tests that can determine and distinguish whether a person has lactose intolerence, a milk allergy or a lactase deficiency. These tests include the milk test, elimination diet, breath test, intestinal biopsy, stool acidity test and the blood glucose test. If a person suspects they have this condition after experiencing lactose intolerent symptoms, the first thing they should do is make sure they have spoken with their doctor before beginning any sort of lactose free diet. Because lactose intolerence is a well-known medical condition, there are many people that just assume that if they suffer from lactose intolerent symptoms that they have lactose intolerence. This person may actually have another underlying reason for the cause of their symptoms that should be treated. When a person assumes they have lactose intolerence and cut all milk products from their diet, they may not be aware that they need to take supplements to replace the calcium they once received from the milk products. This can result in severe long-term effects.\r\n\r\nDownload the app to know more..",

            "I was excited to use this app to avoid egg products. It seemed quite user friendly. I read previous reviews that it doesn't have a very good database for products. I scanned various items in my home (about 15) between condiments, various crackers, cookies, bars etc. Some I knew were egg-free, some I knew were not, some I didn't know and I only had 5 identify that they did not contain my allergen and the rest were not found. This won't be helpful for me and my family, so I uninstalled it.",
            "This app is a great concept but needs a larger database to be more useful. it's lacking several common things such as cereals, pastas etc. I scanned about about 20 things from my pantry but only got results on 5. Keep expanding the data set, this could be a wonderful tool.",
            "Would be helpful to put a chocolate anaphylactic allergy or an option for people to edit the allergy list. Also would be nice for audio playback for those that have a hard time seeing",
            "It has absolutly no database it was a great concept but this app is useless",
            "Do not get this app if you are trying to acually use it. Thos app was created by a middle school atusent and doesn't work when you scan most products I scanned milk to test it and the app said I could have it. Before you scan anything the app asks for your allergies and I put Dairy and then is when I scanned the milk and it said I could have it. Over all this app is NOT a function app."

            "Great While It Lasted. I really thought I had found the perfect app to track my symptoms. I spent a huge amount of time entering info. Then, I made the mistake of logging out. Now it won't let me log back in. It says it's sending me a confirmation email to restore my data. But I'm not getting it. I've tried a dozen times & checked my spam/junk folder a hundred times. I'm not receiving the email. I'm so very disappointed. I haven't found another app that covers so much detail. :-(",
            "Adding food and meds can be tedious as a lot of options aren't available. This makes sense as the developer is based in Germany and I live in the US. I also don't add each ingredient, because so many foods have some degree of salt or oil, and those show up in the \"best/worst ingredients,\" even though I know those aren't my triggers. I think the most irritating part is that when I add \"no poop\" so I can log symptoms, it shows in the report that I pooped. Still a mostly useful app.",
            "I like the idea of this, especially the food tracker to see what foods may be causing me trouble. The only really frustrating part is also the food tracker. They only seem to have half the things I try and put in and it really isn't that user friendly with that function either. The rest of it works pretty well so, despite the food tracker being what I really wanted, I mostly just record symptoms which, in itself, is still helpful.",
            "Great app and is very detailed with a nice user interface. My only critism is when adding pictures to food - it automatically offers to crop or zoom in a landscape rectangle and you can never get the full thing you want in the picture as you can only get part of it. It would be better if it was free crop or zoom within a certain squared area, not a landscape rectangle. An option to export to excel would also be great.",

This is a useful app, for people suffering from gut issues caused by foods. They really need to add nutrition info to the diary because those with gastroparesis need to eat less fiber and not more. I have not found an app where the amount of fiber is customizable. And for this app, it would be appropriate.",

Prior to the formation of the FODMAP concept, diet was seldom used as first line therapy for management of IBS, Crohn's, Colitis, Lactose intolerance and other FGID.\r\n\r\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms—including abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns without evidence of underlying damage.

It is offered \"as is\", and most likely no further updates will be released.***\r\n\r\nThe heart of the app is a diary in which you can record all the individual food items that you eat for each meal of the day. In addition you can also record any symptoms you experience which may be caused by some of these food items. The exact time and date is recorded for each entry, to build up a comprehensive picture of your diet and symptoms on an hour by hour, day by day basis. Any other information you wish to record can be entered as \"Notes\" in to the diary.\r\n\r\nEntering the information is easy because the Intolerance Food Diary remembers every food item, symptom, or note that you enter into the diary, so the next time you come to type in that same information it appears ready to select in a drop down list. This makes filling in the diary much quicker and more reliable.\r\n\r\nOnce you have recorded a useful amount of data on your food consumption and symptoms, the app is able to perform a statistical analysis on this information and then give an indication of which food items might be the most likely cause of a specific symptom you are experiencing (the app disregards any notes you have entered). In addition you can look for foods which, after consumption, may have either a short or a long \"incubation period\" before causing a noticeable symptom. This can be done by adjusting a simple slider to influence how the statistical analysis looks at the data. It should be noted that the information provided in this app does not constitute medical advice. You should always consult with a medical professional before embarking on any course of action which may affect your health.\r\n\r\nThe app also allows you to create reports from the data in your food and symptom diary. You can select entries between any two dates, and export the data to a PDF report document or a CSV data file (for use in a spreadsheet). The information can then be emailed to either yourself or the medical professional who is monitoring your diet.\r\n\r\nPaying a small fee to upgrade to the premium version of the app removes all the banner adverts, and allows you access to the \"Backup/Restore Diary\" feature. This allows you to backup your entire diary database to a single file, move that file to a new device, and then restore the diary in full to that new device. You can also do the same with your Food Dictionary database which is built up from all the foods you enter into the app. This allows you to carry on using Intolerance Food Diary with a new device.\r\n\r\nThis app needs certain permissions in order to work correctly. \r\n-- In App Purchases : This is needed to allow users to upgrade to the premium version of the app. However the free version of the app is still fully functional. The only feature non-premium users will not have access to, is the backup/restore diary function - and this feature is only required if you wish to move your diary to a new device.\r\n-- Photos/Media/Files : Don't worry, the app does not go near any media or files already on your device. The app needs this permission in order to create PDF and CSV reports of your food diary, and to save them on your device in a specific \"IntoleranceFoodDiary\" folder. The app then needs to be able to read these report files so you can attach them to an email. It also needs file system access for the backup/restore feature which saves the whole diary database to a single file located in the same specific folder.\r\n-- Network Access : The app needs network access to load the banner adverts which are displayed in the non-premium version of the app. No other data is received or transmitted by the app other than that required for the banner adverts.\r\n\r\nAll data entered into this app is stored locally on your device.

        "comments": [
            "It's very easy to use. Used it for several months now. One thing that could be improved a lot is the analysis of possible intolerances. For example: - It seems the app just tells me what foods I've eaten X hours before the symptom. And obviously the results are just useless. - Add some kind of real correlation analisys between food and symptom occurrences in time that are chosen manually. - At least add a graph between food and symptom occurrences for easy visual comparison.",
            "I really like it's simplicity and you also have the option to receive the summary via email. I had this app back in 2018 when I was eliminating sugar in my body. Deleted it in early 2019 when I became underweight again. But now December 2019, I want to keep track of the food I eat again. So happy to find this for the second time around. This is exactly the app I was looking for. Thank you!",
            "THANK YOU for developing this app. Am finding it a very useful awareness-building and self-training tool. Easy to use. I like it a lot! PS: don't rely on the 'Find intolerences' function though - the algorithm needs a lot of work in order to be useful.",
            "Easy to use. Works well. I'm not sure why we must select \"lunch\" or \"dinner\" etc before entering foods eaten. It's all just food .. Eaten at whatever time it was eaten. This not only requires an extra click, it causes problems if you enter two lunches or dinners in the same day. If that problem we're addressed ... And maybe a better looking and more optimized interface, I would give 5 stars. But I do really like it and it's the best I've found on Android.",
            "Been using for a year and I love it, but it could use a \"search\" feature, for when you want to find the last time you ate ice cream and how it effected you. Right now you have to scroll and find \"ice cream\" through months of entries. Otherwise it's a great app I use all day every day."

            "Helpful for keeping track of food and symptoms but definitely not an app for a newbie. New to having to keep an eye on FODMAPS so wish it was easier to see which was what. There is the ability to pay for highlighting of this but I didn't find the highlights were on each food item. As well, the food options assume you're making things from scratch. Or some searches food items just didn't result in anything and I had to manually add each ingredient. Definitely not gonna be doing that takes forever",
            "I've used several apps to track my IBS-C. I know the developer is still working on this app, but so far I like it. They have a great selection of food items and recipes already in the database. You can easily adjust the recipes, too. After every entry it asks you to rate your triggers (bloating, constipation, etc) which I LOVE! I'm so bad about tracking those. There is no export option yet, which I hope comes soon. Using the free version and there are no ads, either.",

I do hope to see some updates, maybe icon choices between breakfast, lunch and dinner to better distinguish between the three instead of the same icon. Maybe a choice of colors. A little bit would go a long way to making this app great.",

For instance my entry may say 2:15 PM, but when viewing the diary feed it's listed as 14:15. There are no settings or preferences. Also agree with another reviewer that a calendar view for jumping to specific days would be nice.",
            "The free version only gives you a 7 day history. I'm in the middle of unpleasant intolerance symptoms so seeing my logs is imperative and my health depends on it. I don't want to bounce between a lot of apps or reenter info across them. Please consider another barrier, even ads. If I remember this app I might consider trying it when I'm not feeling sick, but this app is designed for sick people, so... It's a bummer because the interface is nice and you can't go wrong with googly eyes.",

            "I use this to track my baby's symptoms as I am still breastfeeding and it works really well. I can add and edit things that I forgot and it's nice to have a scale of how bad the symptoms were for each event. The only thing I would love to see to improve it would be some sort of graph or chart as part of the report showing any patterns instead of having to read back through all of my entries to see if I can find any links."

But it has still a long way to go, many additives are missing, but keep up the good work {edit: OK, I will try to collect the missing additives} Also – for the information to be correct I strongly suggest that you include if the additive MAY BE WHEAT DERIVED. That way a user can make an informed decision. Many Celiac people are still too sensitive to have any additive that was wheat based – like mannitol, MSG, etc.",

A gluten free diet does not help weight loss and is unproven to the only time this is generally the case is down to the rest of a person's diet.

            "Pretty accurate heading. Again HEADING and not a diagnostic So people won't get it wrong about the app. Extremelly helpful, since the test I've inputed on was an already medical confirmed diagnosis and ADA has provided three oprions which one of them is the one I am on current medical treatment. So, I will definitely use it as a pre-docs visit since it helps to describe symptoms to the physician. First use no ads so far, which is great. Lets see if it stays this way.",
            "I absolutely adore this app, I don't see myself ever getting rid of it. If you're ever unsure of what you have or need a guideline for what you may have, it is the most perfect app. It doesn't make you panic, it explains everything and is so calming when you're worried for the worst. Thank you to the creators! I adore this app and I'm so thankful for it!",
            "This is a really awesome app, I use it every time I feel unwell. And it saved me so many trips to the doctor. The UI looks modern, descriptions of either symptoms or diseases is accurate while also easy to understand. And the best thing? it doesn't have ads, some kind of overpriced subscription or anything like that. this one is my must have.",
            "It is generally a good app, but I put my symptoms in and it focused more on my mild headache and other small things than the actual problem that caused me to try this in the first place which was more important than that head ache, it does this quite a lot but other than this, it's quite good! It is a good way to track symptoms and I haven't seen many ads but it does need to work on the symptom assessment a bit more, but that said, it is hard to make that perfect but it can help.",
            "This app is extremely helpful, I've used it dozens of times since I downloaded. Love that it remembers details about people other than me. It would be cool to have the option to import my medical records .... Not sure if that is something that would be possible to do? Either way, I've love this app, and it never takes long before I feel the need to download it onto a new phone."

Super visual si eliges u tipo de alerta (lactosa por ejemplo) te saca en rojo si el producto escaneado lo tiene como ingrediente. De verdad muy muy útil tanto si tienes alergias o intolerancia como si quieres realmente saber que contiene lo que comes y no tienes una lupa a mano! Ademas te saca los productos relacionados pero en \"bueno para mi\", por ejemplo un pan de molde sin aceite de palma. Me encanta y lo estoy recomendando a mi grupo de intolerancia",

            "This is such a great idea, and I can see the developers are really putting their hearts and souls into this. Unfortunately, the mobile app component doesn't quite work the way I would like it to, and maybe that's just me. 1) I spent an hour exploring the features and how to do everything, and there were just way too many rabbit holes I fell into - oops, that didn't do quite what I thought it would - backtrack, start over. I would like to see more simplicity. 2) I'm disappointed you have to get the app to get the Health Tracker feature. I can see the benefit of being able to gather information on the fly without having to visit your desktop computer, but when there's a lot of typing involved (for searches and such) it would be nice to be able to manage that date from my desktop computer. 3) When I first signed up for this, I envisioned a tracking feature that, once I entered everything I ate on a given day, would give me a summary of all the nutrients included in all I ate that day. I only found calories, fats, carbs, and [some other thing I can't remember now]. You can make that a pro feature, but I did not see where you have done this. 4) I would have strongly considered the Pro version if it included a \"low fat\" profile.",
            "On Android, when you click Contact Us, it gives me options to share content via other apps?? No info on how to contact the Devs about issues. Also, if I scan a barcode that's not in the system, it asks me to take 3 pictures. After I do, I get the same issue as the Contact Us button, with a pop up to share content. So I can only add food by searching for it and clicking add food at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise the app is good. The UI could be cleaned up a bit, but I'm happy with it so far.",
            "I thought this app was a really great idea and I still think it is but it doesn't seem like anybody is really putting any work into it there's a lot of good foods out there that they're saying is bad for no good reason they're foods out there that are slightly processed or have a little bit of added sugar that are way better than a lot of other things but they're going to make you think that it's not good because it's slightly processed. processed doesn't mean bad",
            "It wouldn't keep my manual changes to calories and target date, etc. When I went to \"contact us,\" it kept taking me to a quick share option that didn't provide me with any email or other form of contact information. Very frustrating",
            "Such a great app not only for tracking my food, but also for finding better options when it comes to some foods. I love that you can scan the barcode on a package (most packages) and get a letter grade and explanation for it's grade (whether it's preservatives, added sugar, etc). And as mentioned, it will offer alternatives to the scanned item so that you might be able to find a similar but healthier option. I do pay for premium now but even before that I found the app immensely helpful shopping"

Either the snack section is for snacks and the drink section for drinks or add a drink tick chart in each section. With breakfast, lunch, dinner...",

The app works perfectly for my purposes right now, but if working with a nutritionist or something, being able to send the info for a day, a week, etc would be a huge assist, even if it were just some kind of full-day review screen that I could screen shot. Otherwise, no complaints, aside from the annoying adds😉",

            "Great app - been using it since 2012, and been a PRO user for a large chunk of that time. Love especially being able to use it both on my phone and in browser - can obviously type faster on the computer, although I do find the mobile interface faster. Today the website seems to not be loading tags or folders, but hoping that's a temporary issue! Edit: all working now, thanks!",
            "I've been trying many journaling and diary apps in search of one that suits my needs. Being able to create different color coded sections with tags, entry dates, weather, and even a map of where I wrote the entry was really cool. It took me a little while to get used to it, but I did and I really like it. I need to keep track of many different things, and Diaro has been working the best for me. I love that Diaro backs up to Dropbox and synchs with all of my devices.",
            "I have been a user of this app since 2015. What makes this app better than its many competitors is its excellent customer service! If you send them an email with a concern, they are on top of it with a quick response with a fix or to inform you that their working on it expediently yet apologetically. Great group of support staff!",
            "I don't usually leave reviews, but this app is one of the exceptions. I really love writing and so I went to look for an app where I can pour all my ideas into. I found this app and I really loved it. The word count, folders, fonts and size adjustments are amazing. I find writing with this app really comfortable. Definitely would recommend.",
            "A great electronic diary. After hand writing a daily diary for 30 years I finally went electronic in 2018. I love this app. It's really easy to use and backs up to Dropbox efficiently every night. The ability to save your diary into a Word document is brilliant. Wish there was the facility on the app to get a year's diary printed into a book professionally. That's the only thing I'd add. Addendum: I've been using this for two years. I still love it. It's never failed me!"

            "Worst experience with BB daily. I have been complaining in the support chat of App and through mails regarding keeping milk pocket and other items on shoe rack. This is happening for past 20 days. But not resolved. They are not bothering to resolve the issue. They are playing with customers health. This is pandemic time. They don't have social responsibility. They don't have minimum concern of customers health",
            "The BB app shows one discount in banner, but when you add the item in cart, it shows full value of the product. I happened to check it, else would hv ended up being cheated. App doesn't allow to share pictures twice in duration of chat. You can attach it only once",
            "My experience with bbdaily is quite good. The products of daily needs such as milk, vegetables, bakery items etc. are always available. The rates of products are quite reasonable. The delivery service is also satisfactory. No issue till date.",
            "Pathetic app. Though this app is just selling food items but still they don't tie up with any food cards like Sodexo or zeta . While other competitors are doing it like groffers, swigy . not sure founders of this app are sleeping or not progressive at all. Soon people would go away from this daily app if they don't make improvements.",
            "False promotional messages of cashback when you stop ordering from this app. False claims by marketing folks on milk offers. Fresh produce always has a problem. Unfortunately I recharged looking at offers and now there is no cashback. I had gone away for good from this app due to its quality issues. Worse thing for feedback discussion they call you first thing in the morning on a Saturday or Sunday. Not sure what's wrong with these folks. That's the time when people are resting and won't talk!!"

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "Just starting to use the app and it works perfectly for me. Simple and easy to use. Just a comment: Can add an option to sort the diary entries? Sometimes I want to view it by the diary date, the created date, or title; depending on my use. Tried to do so just now but cannot find a way. Would be really useful if the feature is available.",
            "Such a cool app, but the problem is that I don't want to pay to be able to use certain things. I get it, that's how you make money and whatnot but still, I just want to write the entries like I would write them on a piece of paper. With everything available. Still the app is really cool and I love it.",
            "The app's pretty good, it has different themes, different emotes on each entry, and way, way, more. I'm not gonna complain that it isn't free (not all features are there cause I didn't pay for premium) cause I understand that companies have to find a way to make money. I really recommend this app for anyone who likes journaling or just wants to try it out!",
            "First of all, I would like to thank you so much for the existence of this journaling app! I have tried other apps in the past and I'm glad I have finally found this one! The themes are simplistic, beautiful and calming. And I really adore the quality of the stickers, it gives such an aesthetic touch to the diary entries. May I suggest a Web version for the diary? I appreciate the Google sync feature, but a Web version would do wonders. I can't write on the computer because I can't install the app and sync. If there's a Web version, surely I'll be able to write on the computer just as I would on my phone or tablet. And I would really love if you add more free stickers, I love them so much. So far, I'm giving it 5 stars. No ads or constant pop-ups to buy the premium. It's all very relaxing and appropriate for journaling. Keep it up!",
            "Everything about this app is AWESOME! I have to found any problems. I love how if you forgot your password you can type questions! Oh wait.. here's my actual problem.... Nothing! Also I'm so glad that there are no ads!"

            "Its a great app and you can always add to it, being a vegan this app is a definite help. Just have to use common sense and Google translate when they have special articles in German.",
            "I highly recommend this app. I use it before every purchase and results show immediately. I also like that it shows alternative products to my intended one. With this app it is easy to make healthier and eco friendlier buying decisions. A great thank you to the developers and please continue to expand the range of articles and continue to improve this app to be compatible with future IT development.",
            "The idea is very good. There are plenty of products reviewed. I love the recommended articles written by codecheck and the fact that they contain product recommendations. Minor bugs: - It may contain misleading information due to the fact that users can upload data about various products without those being certified by a mod. - The app is laggy from time to time - The user can upvote the same comment multiple times without the option to withdraw its vote if the button was mistakenly pressed.",
            "I love this app. It really helps to find unhealthy or alarming ingredients. For example microplastic, palmoil and chemicals which can affect my health. I can only recommend it to everyone!",
            "Great app that can gives you information about variety of products (food, cosmetics) by scanning the barcode. It also highlights potentially negative ingredients (e.g. high salts)"

I was looking for something exactly like this because I can’t be bothered to enter calories or even (or even search for) food descriptions. All I needed was something to make me be aware of what I was eating, and to record whether it was on the path or not. You have made it so easy and it’s really helping me every day!\" - Phil\r\n\r\n“I just wanted to let you know that since I started using your app I have lost 30lbs.

We end up forgetting what and why we truly are eating. We just simply turn to food, shovel it down and move on.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this behavior on our health is both physical and emotional. Getting us into a loop where we find ourselves digging a deeper hole to health problems. We try diets and other quick fixes, but all they do for us, in the long run, is cause us to be even more stressed and frustrated.\r\n\r\nThat is why we built Ate, the mindful food diary that is thoughtfully designed to help you be more self-aware of your eating habits, behaviors, and feelings. All done without ever judging you or making you feel bad. \r\n\r\nWe worked with health professionals around the world and built the app on journaling techniques that have been proven over decades.\r\n\r\nThis food diary app is not about crash diets or restrictive living by calorie counting. It’s about building a sustainable, healthy lifestyle. A better version of yourself one small habit at a time. Something that you can easily maintain and enjoy in the long run. \r\n\r\nRemember, HEALTH IS PHYSICAL, MENTAL & EMOTIONAL (+ SOCIAL).

Or if you scan a cereal and mentions calories with milk it then shows that the product contains milk. Actually continued using the app over the last few weeks and found it quite useful.

            "The feedback by developers that \"levels are balanced and can be completed without purchases\" is bogus. That's like saying you can walk 20 miles to work if you don't have a car. Technically true, practically untenable. Unless you don't care about quickly progressing through levels and don't mind saving up measly 2-ruby daily rewards...skip this. It's an awesome game but without making constant in-app purchases, it's too frustrating to be worth anyone's time. Also the house/pet features are dumb.",
            "It's fun but can get get frustratingly difficult. It's annoying how many gems you need to upgrade your restaurants later when you barely get any. I wish they would change it so you can buy the pet stuff with coins instead of gems, because I don't want to waste my precious gems on them. I know you can get pet stuff via challenges but it can be difficult.",
            "I did so much progress in this game, unlocking new restaurants and having so much equipment and upgraded stuff, I don't remember when or why, but I uninstalled it, now I remembered it and I installed it again, as expected everything was gone, I just made a character and did the tutorial, afterwards, it showed my saves, and it showed that other save and I thought it would bring back all the progress I'd done but it didn't, I just want to know how to restore everything.",
            "I love how there seems to be endless levels without in-app purchases. But... when I first started to play upgrading the interior of the restaurants cost way less bank notes. I don't want to spend hard earned gems on that. I'm saving those for the kitchen. Why did you guys jack up the prices of things? Plus the new house thing. The shear amount of gems I'd need to purchase ONE piece of furniture is rediculous!! So i pretty much ignore that feature. And why do in-app purch cost so much?",
            "I honestly really enjoyed this game to begin with. It was fun, interesting and I really like the guild feature. But I've been playing for maybe a week or so and now it's asking me to pay rubies to upgrade things. I don't have a lot of rubies and I think it's really silly that that are so expensive! You don't earn nearly enough rubies to actually make it worth the wait. The entire game is centered around them and it's really not fun to play anymore as everything gets more expensive! :("

            "This app is simple to use and to the point. The ads are also not invasive or distracting. Overall this app is A great way to keep track. However, it would be great if there was a feature to view a snapshot of what the user inputs for the week and/or month. How it is now, the user must click on each day to see what was previously input on the calendar And that is a bit annoying.",
            "I really like this app--it's easy to use, and I love many of thr features. The only thing I don't like (and I dislike enough to not give 5 stars) is that there is no category option for \"dessert,\" but there is a tag for \"junk.\" I want to be able to log my after-dinner chocolate with a label that describes what it is (not a \"snack\" or just \"food\"), but the lack of option other than \"junk\" feels annoyingly diet culture-y and shaming. That one flaw aside, this app is very good and suits my needs",
            "Great + easy to use. Would be nice to edit some of the categories mainly on the drink names as there is things I don't drink, such as energy drinks. Otherwise a good app, like that I can export the CSV to Google sheets and it's quick to add entries.",
            "Simple but effective. I was looking for something in which to record the meals that I was eating so that I could be more conscious about what I was eating. I wasn't interested in counting calories but I was interested in eating less. This works perfectly, though I do wish it populated a list of my prior meals in a drop-down rather than do the incremental search that it does.",
            "At the very beginning i thought what kind of journal doesnt keep track of days Pryor days was about to delete. I have since figured it out. Not only does it track food and water it as few other helpful things to track exercise, meds, supplements and a other other button. I will find this app to be very useful. I would have however been happy with a little tutorial."

Also it takes 8 hours to get one freaking shovel !! Also the pad locks, shovels, and nails should not be included in the barn items. They take up too much room. If you can't sell it then it shouldn't be in there. Store it somewhere else.",
            "I have played this game for a long time. I can't tell if you are trying to get players or loose players. Every event, animal add on, and ect; you ask for 6 or more of the same thing, constantly repeating, everything requesting the same material to finish the product. The problem has got so bad you are loosing players because they can't get ahead or finish anything and no help from co-op, they're in the same boat. Please understand you are loosing players not gaining players.",
            "This was a great game until, it started freezing, before this whenever I started the game it used to freeze for 5 sec and the game ran properly thereafter. But now it keeps on freezing many a times. And even I updated the game thinking that, this was happening cuz I didn't update for a long time, but I was wrong. I don't know why this is happening, otherwise I loved playing this game, particularly.",

I am not happy and in the past I loved playing this game. PLEASE FIX or i will no longer play the game.",
            "Game play is slow, difficult to water plants and feed livestock, the button doesn't respond or work. I've already submitted a report but it has not been addressed or fixed yet. This game has a lot of bugs that makes playing such a chore and taking the fun out of it. What happened to you guys? Update: Two updates were added 10/09/20. Only lasted a full minute before returning to its slow-mo pace. Can you recommend another alternate game, until you get your stuff together? Just saying..🤷"

When I take a photo the screen freezes for 10 seconds before it acknowledges it. For my diary yesterday (Monday) it is saying it is today (Tuesday) instead. Also some of the days have timestamps of when I ate the meal yet other days show when my reminder is set. The clocks changed at the weekend but the app hasn't aligned with that, as my phone now buzzes at the wrong time.",
            "Good app. Does what I need. But sometimes......usually after about 4 weeks it plays up to the point where I have to uninstall and download again.",
            "Easy to use and supports tracking food without numbers. And by default set up to encourage eating 6x a day, which is great. But the number of ads for premium services is a lot -- I can't ever just log my food without closing an ad. Sometimes meal updates and edits don't reflect in the daily view until later. And now I can't move to the next day without a blocking ad. Please fix these things -- I would happily recommend this app to everybody I know if it weren't for them.",
            "I wish this app worked. It's a great idea. I'm running the latest version of Android on a Pixel phone and the app still has errors. The PDF function doesn't work. When I click the today function it takes me to the wrong day. Super frustrating.",

This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are breastfed, however, may be normal. The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite; a condition known as gastroenteritis.These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. It may be divided into three types: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and if it lasts for more than two weeks, persistent diarrhea. The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea, including lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause.",

            "I use this app a lot! Especially with the pandemic going on I want to make sure I'm utilizing everything I have in the kitchen to the fullest extent. Having everything laid out in the pantry section makes it super easy to get cooking inspiration. The shopping list function is also really helpful. The recipe search function is great and makes things very clear. I feel so much more organized in the kitchen now that I'm using this app!",
            "I like it so far. However, there are a few issues. There is no way to know if you have 0 of an item unless you click on it. It would be nice to have a way to mass add anything that has a 0 quantity to the shopping list. Also it does not appear that you can delete or rename categories you created. Can you please add these features?",
            "The meal planning is on point. You can easily add recipes you find online, although they aren't very customizable. Grocery list is great but pantry creates all sorts of duplicates. Great features and easy to use but does need improvement.",
            "So far it's been great, it feels more user friendly than some of the other similar apps I've used. I love the pantry idea, I just have to take the time to actually input it all",
            "I'm still getting used to everything; but overall, I really like the app! I can plan meals that I find within the app or import recipes from online OR enter my own. It keeps a log of what's in your pantry and helps you keep track of what may be expiring and what you will need from the store, (just make sure you check off whether you've made the recipe or not). I haven't used all the features yet, but overall my meal planning has gone to another level."

While it's very extensive, some of the results do NOT provide the points, so you must manually calculate, if you can. And, as someone else pointed out, the scan function is not working properly. It does not give you the points per serving. It gives you points for the entire quantity. It's easy to calculate, but having the scan function work would be nice. But thank you for this!!!",

            "Great app with easy-to-use interface. The icon happens to display my birthdate so it kinda won me over a little. Tried using it and another app for a few days and am glad it's so simple yet customisable. I also like that I can attach photos/videos in the diary. It's really like a diary on-the-go. Eventually uninstalled the other app and stuck with this. However, fingerprint unlocking is a little slow to react. Would be good if it can detect and unlock faster.",
            "I've been using this app for more than a year. It's the most treasured diary app I have. I'm on premium and its the best. Thank you for the export to pdf function, its ingenious! And also all the back up and restore options. I was told that to log into my Google account I had to reinstall the app. It was nerve wrecking thinking about the chances of losing my data but everything worked fine. :)",
            "Purchased the one-off premium feature, I got 50% and another RM2 discount. So far, I like the features. You can change the fonts, add pictures and emoji as emotions of your daily day. You can even take a look at others story, but you can choose to mute this feature. I wanted to write to express my emotions and I find out that this apps is compatible with my style, it's simple but all you need is there. Gonna use this for a very long time so I hope it'll always be this great! Thanks!",
            "This app is really great!! ❤️ I Love it so much since the day i downloaded it to be honest. Its features are really cool. We could attach pictures, videos, gifs and audios etc.. And it has a mood tracks of our days and we could write our thoughts sooo much and has a lot of space to write. It even has a calendar to mark or anniversaries and can be added to all years.!!!I really love this app. Its more effective than writing a journal. 5 Stars.",
            "I haven't had this app for long but this is great. I love the fonts and colors we can use. I also love how you can put it on private or share it with other people.

Can you please fix this...and maybe add the option of switching to lb or kg, depending on preference. AND you cant remove it if you make a mistake!  And...when you try to send comments directly to them...the email address is invalid!!  I'm losing faith in this app... Please fix...Thanks.",
            "App has lots of potential, but lots of problems. It's easy to log food, meds, stools, symptoms. However, the food database is very small and while it's easy to add foods I was adding multiple foods per day, every day. The med list is more complete but isn't searchable, and has spelling errors (falgyl). Worst, there's no way to go back and edit logs, or delete if you make a mistake. Also was really hoping the app would correlate symptoms to foods... It doesn't.",
            "I was really excited to learn that the CDHF created an app to log activity related to digestive disorder for Canadians.   However; my excitement soon turned to frustration in using this app.  There's no edit button,  once you log your entries it is written in stone.  You can't go back and make any changes.   Furthermore; on logging your meals, if you don't choose an item from the predetermined list and just make an entry via the 'Add Notes' , and attempt to log, the app will crash.",
            "Useful as but the inability to make any changes or delete incorrect entries makes it frustrating to use.  Also the previous meals options are buggy - often what I select isn't what shows on the screen.",

            "All the soups that showed up first did not look appetizing then when it said \"load more recipes\" you have to switch to premium to get them. That's stupid but okay... I click on it to see how much it costs to get better soup recipes and it took me to a page that would not load. That's stupid too so how about not wasting my time and move on to a better app.",
            "First of all; potatoes is listed twice; why do you have to pick 4 items when give people more options for soups; if you try to load more premium; which is another version of Spotify due to premium!!",
            "lots of recipes. Love the shopping list feature. other great features as well.",
            "App is a disappointment. Why do I have to pay for soup recipes. When you can simply Google them. It looked interesting at first now just a let down."

            "Way too expensive, $9.99 per month is crazy. Amazon and Netflix are the same price and this app is not offering anything near what you get for those services. In the free version all fish are locked except large mouth bass. I live in Florida and fish only salt water so the free large mouth bass doesn't help me. Basically the app is useless. Also the app doesn't even tell you the best times of the day to fish.",
            "Used to love it.. I lost the notifications that sounds like a fishing reel. I loved it!! Now it hardly ever notifies me. I havent placed it on sleep either. I have the most update version. There is no way I would pay for this app. Too buggy. I get notification for a fish caught \"in my area\" and when I click on it, says line snapped.New posts are irrelevant to me and my area. I'm seeing spots that are 1-2 hours away. I modified my feed and still get nothing useful. Please fix.",
            "It's good for logging catches, seeing which spots are most popular and adding your own custom waypoints to the map - as a suggestion, could you include the ability to add gear that isn't already listed in the app? It's frustrating that I can't include the gear I use because there's no option to add an item that isn't already listed",
            "Let me get this straight.... You get to take my money every month without actually providing a functional app?? This new update bombards me with notifications without actually allowing me to use the app. Login is completely non functional. Update: ten days later and I still can't login. Hitting 'login' does nothing. Update: the app is now working properly. Thanks",
            "Has potential to be a very useful fishing app if it would actually let you view, filter, and organize the underlying data effectively. Like how can you not view data for a selected lake? Unfortunately it seems to have a major in being a social media app with an uncompleted minor in fishing."

            "This is the best calorie counter app ever....my fitnesspal is definately not for me far too complicated and very time consuming also if you go out to dinner and your battery dies??? Or there's a power failure... Then what....you can't calculate your calorie intake. Also the majority of calorie counting apps you need to either sign in with your email address or Facebook that's really dumb. ....I'm old school it's far easier to keep a food journal...thank you for keeping it simple",
            "Awesome! Has most of the common foods like potatoes, chicken and beef calories precisely, however the strawberry fruit gets lost when you search for strawberry.. it displays flavors of strawberry.. other than that it's really2x helpful for me when i'm tracking down calories of foods..",
            "Very easy and simple app that helps me keep track of my daily calorie intake. I have been using the calorie counter for less than 1 week and I am already noticing a healthy improvement in my eating habits. I love that it also works offline.",
            "Perfect...easy to use. I like that everything is in 100grs, it helps to calculate portions easier. Great database",
            "Easy to use. Amazing number of choices. I've only been using it for two days and I'm very pleased."

            "So, originally i was thinking this is a great app, just from the few recipes that i had looked at, but as i dig deeper into it, it's actually very disorganized. I don't quite get how there are all of these different categories, but not everything in each category fits. There are dessert recipes in the dinner category and dinner recipes in the dessert category. In addition, there are definitely recipes repeated and some recipes which have different titles but the same cover picture as others...",
            "Decent app but disappointing to see fried eggs on several of the stock photos. Eggs are NOT vegan. Please update the photos. Also, why do I have to see an advert after every recipe I look at? Once every three recipes would be more reasonable.",

            "Game-changer for me. I'm not a good cook and it's probably the only place I've found where ingredient quantities are just right in general (and expressed in metric units!). Also the instructions are easy to follow and timing fits well. I now eat more varied, grocery shopping is way easier and I waste less food.",
            "I am obsessed with this app! Here are the top reasons I love it: - It is so easy to use. - It is aesthetically pleasing. - It compiles a grocery list for you that you can add to. - The way that the recipe pages are laid out is GOLD. 👌 I don't have to scroll through a blog. I can click on three sections (utensils needed, ingredients needed, and instructions (with ingredients listed underneath so that I'm not having to click back and forth). - Etc.",
            "So far amazing. This is my first week using the app and I'm honestly just loving it. This app curbs my nasty habit of over shopping at the grocery store and yet still forgetting some essential items. I don't have to research recipes that fit into my Keto lifestyle, it's all layed out for me. Just click, and go. I'm honestly shocked at how easy it is to use and how incredibly helpful it is. This is not your turn of the mill list app or meal app. It's all here!",
            "Absolutely five stars. Easy interface, you add recipes to your plan and it automatically generates a categorized grocery list for you. Gone are the days of running around the grocery store grabbing useless stuff that goes to waste, and wasting money. I've been using this app for about 2 months and I'll never go back. I've been using the free version up until now, but I'm about to pay for the premium subscription because it truly is just that good. No, this is in no way an ad.",
            "This app has really helped me and my husband start to meal plan. I've tried to meal plan multiple times and just can't stick to it or it takes up too much time. Having the gluten free option definitely helps as well (celiac here) so thanks for including that! I've thought about going for the pro version but a yearly cost of about £50 is a bit much. I'd maybe consider a one off payment of that, or maybe if it was paying per meal bundle (since I'm assuming that's why it's a yearly payment)."

            "Best app I found for seeing if certain foods will aggravate my food sensitivities without having to scan every goddamned label and look everything up myself. Could stand to be fleshed out a bit more, but a great tool nonetheless.",
            "This is a very addictive sites to look at ingredients but no longer possible to use it on browser unless you just browse by the category only but good to look at nutrition fact.",
            "I began using this app when my doctor recommended I do the low fodmap diet for 6 weeks. I thought this would make shopping for specific foods a lot easier. Boy, was I wrong. It is not accurate when you scan items in the store. For example, I would scan items, and it would say to avoid this item because of a certain ingredient in it, like soy. I would then look at the ingredients on the product and nowhere would it be listed. I would not recommend this app.",
            "So far so good! My only suggestion would be to add a filter menu to searches / scanned items / lists, which provides options for sorting by food groups, brands, descending/ascending number rating, and excellent, good, poor, etc. matches only. As it is, looking through lists and searches is a nightmare when you have a LOT of items to look through. Another helpful feature would be to add an option to filter out duplicate items in searches--I once had a search give me 10+ dupes for several items.",
            "I was reluntant at first to try this app due to a lot of negative reviews and comments. I just found out some food allergies that is includes in lots of foods, such as wheat, and this app is a good help. It also helps with other ingredients you want to avoid, such as sugar, etc. It even shows you foods that will be good for you to choose that disclides everything, which is good for someone new to a bad allergy trying to find new foods to eat. So far, I love this app"

I understand the need for the income, but see no compensation for the contributers. I would like to see something like 'free short-term premium for X reviews/additions'.",
            "Awesome app. Have been using for years, and they have the most expansive reviews in even off the main road areas. Have used in other countries and was really helpful in our first trip to Barcelona. Travel in states we have used for first time trips - Chicago, Nashville, Kingsport, road trips between cities, Portland, Oregon Coast, Oahu just as examples.",
            "must have for anyone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. I'm not thrilled with the new \"premium\" features, but I spoke to the developer and understand why he implemented them. and there are a couple ways around using them, if you're cash-strapped like me and don't eat out enough to need them.",
            "It has definitely been useful in some countries, but not in others. Really needs a lot more input from users to be as helpful as possible. Frequently I have to add new places as there are no reviews - and the app fights you tooth and nail when you try to add places. But we will get there! And I would still say it is a \"must have\" for a traveling celiac.",
            "Every useful feature is now behind a pay wall. Used to have several features I've paid for off and on over the years, now there is absolutely no point to the free version of the app. And the price isn't worth it for questionable crowd sourced information that might be detrimental to your health."

Dr Greger is a genuinely good person who was inspired by his grandmother beating cancer and has shared her tips in this easy to use, free app!!",
            "this app is wonderful. i am a huge fan of Dr. G,. his work to improve the health of the planet is such a blessing and a totally free gift~ that is true altruism and genuine compassion. the app takes me about 25 seconds to do and its an awesome way to remind me the holes in my diet to be mindful of filling. its a thing of beauty! and i thank him and his staff😀🌷🌞! I stand by everything I said earlier in my first review, but PLEAZE bring back the vit D box &above all THE FULL SCREEN SUN BURST!!",
            "I don't write much reviews but this is one of the best apps I have used. It's simple and effective, with lots of useful and wonderful information. My daily life has become an adventure of exploring and discovering new food and vegetables and it has changed my life for better. Thank you Dr. Greger 🌱🍑🥦🙂",

All of these foods have plethora of data supporting their ability to fight disease. App gamifies eating healthier (how many checkboxes can you get for how many days), free, well formatted.",
            "Exceptional app. Easy to use. So practical, taking much of the stress away from daily food choices. I recommend this over any other system/plan I've come across for eating a plant-based diet or just eating healthier."

Upon further investigation, you seem to be using / sharing a database with openfood facts. Not sure if you have the ability to manually add items.",

            "I really like this app. I live the design and the idea but it has 1 major flaw. The fact that people are able to manually contribute additional items that were not in the system before is a GREAT idea and I love it but at the same time it comes with a problem. The app base it's ratings off of 100g of the item however when people input the nutritional data they will use the number that are listed on the product which often are based on a different number of grams. This causes bad data."

            "Update: I started to really like it but, very expensive for a free game. Spent $15 already out of cash and diamonds, level 17. Storage is all full (expensive upgrade) Can't get any further without spending another $15 on the cheapest pop-up now, or playing very slowly :( I'd say about $10 a day to enjoy. Great graphics, but I'm just tired of \"free games\" costing a fortune, especially when we're all unemployed, stuck at home and broke",
            "Great game at first, then they rob you and limit you from buying any trees, bushes, and flowers. They steal your coins and change the prices on each item that you buy and sell at a lower price. I don't understand this game is no fun anymore. I do enjoy my neighbors and my members that play in my group. They too are worried about the game ugh why are you doing this to the game? I really enjoy this game. Please give me my coins back 30,000. I didn't do anything but move my strawberries around ?",
            "I used to enjoy the game until all the recent changes were made, too many problems to write here without running out of room, don't waste space on your devices you will be disappointed! and the developers just keep giving everyone the same bs about maintaining game balance blah blah as an excuse for their crappy updates, a good game completely ruined! PS thanks for the reply but unless these ridiculous changes are reversed I doubt very much I will be sticking with you's!",
            "I have played this game for a long time and worked hard to get where I am in it and have, mostly, enjoyed it. Then, out of the blue, just like many of the other games they made progress much more difficult so that in order to make real progress you have to buy coins or whatever. Dont do it. Dont load this game. You will be let down. There are other games like this one... maybe give them a try.",
            "I have played this game every day for over 1 year. Can only buy items when I first get my check once a month. Never had a problem getting stuff from the store. When someone buys an item it would take it off right away. Now for 2 days straight, every time I see a item that's hard to find and I try to get it you say it's been sold but keep it up there like it hasn't been bought. It really makes you mad. Normally when it has been bought you take it right off. To me that's cheating. Please stop it."

            "Apart from the occasional incorrect listing in the food database, this is the best calorie counting app I've found. Easily the best looking UI, with a clean uncluttered layout, and great features. Had a small hiccup where changing phones caused the app to lose my premium subscription, but the developer sorted it out quickly. Would be 5 stars but for the database errors. In fairness, I have never found a similar app that didn't have the same problem.",
            "It's been pretty good so far. I've noticed my girlfriends app she uses that cost $2.99 one time has less of a library of foods already in the database. The recipes are nice and it syncs with a lot of the other health apps. My main complaint is the inability to set my own calorie and macro goals. If this is fixed, I would consider extending my subscription when it is up.",
            "I have used other apps including Weight Watchers. This app is as user friendly as any I have used including a scanning option for tracking food. What makes this different is this app let's you see the nutrients in the food you eat. I thought I ate a lot of protein daily, but it turns out I was wrong. I wanted to include more carbs in my diet and this app has helped me to do that and to discover healthy carbs to add daily. I appreciate the reminders through the day.",
            "Barcode scanner is super quick and has almost everything I've ever scanned, have used the app for a couple years now in a couple of ways (weight loss, maintenance, muscle building gains) and the only thing I can say I miss from this app is a pregnancy option to help stay on track with how many calories you should be eating for positive healthy weight gain during each trimester. Every other aspect of the app is awesome.",
            "I am very disappointed about the latest update released yesterday, the new interface is just to ruin the effect, I don't understand why put all the food logs into each meal so that we have to perform 1 extra click to see the details? I will adjust the quantity quite often, now I have to think in which meal to find my food again and have to give an extra unnecessary click to edit it."

            "Although this app doesn't use meat as an ingredient in any recipes, they do list various cheeses (with no mention of using a plant-based substitute) and chicken broth in recipes. Quite a few actually. I directly inquired why they call/advertise the app as \"Vegan Recipes\" when recipes use or call for animal products. I have yet to recieve a response after months. Seems like false advertising that blurs the lines of vegetarianism and veganism. This app should be called \"Vegetarian Recipes\".",
            "Love the recipes. I've tried several so far. I make the frozen cream shake recipe about every week",

            "The recipes are good. They use a lot of pasta. The lack of a print button means you have to flip through a lot of pages which makes it difficult to use."

            "I had purchased the pro version of this app - which for some reason is now discontinued. I am now being asked to pay a onetime amount for a repeated pro subscription by the developers. Have reached out to them multiple times over email and have received only one automated response in return. Taking money for the pro version then pulling the application out -- that's a proper scam. There is no guarantee that, if one pays for the pro subscription now, these developers won't ring in the same scam again. Uninstall. Move on.",
            "I have purchased the pro version which I prefer over the free one. This isn't a bad app at all but there is certainly loads of room for improvement. Some suggestions: Add a barcode scanner, healthy alternative options, recipes, grocery lists, conversions and being able to connect to different exercise devices or: Fitbit, Garmin, Google fit etc. My rating will definitely change to 5 star with some or all of these options included.",
            "I've used this app before, paid for the basics. Now that is gone, when I look for foods most are gone now. It's like you deleted your food library. Uninstalling it and looking for a new app. No longer works for me.",
            "Had this app numerous times, and every time ive tried a new one always came back to this one. Super easy and simple as well as personally effective to see what helps me to track what i eat. For someone like me who has ibs it is great to log what u have eaten that day and symptoms as well as weight loss planning :)",
            "I had the Pro version of this a while ago, and it worked wonderfully. Now, I didn't mind needing to pay for Pro again with the new app, but I'm pretty upset that I can't even access the features I paid for... I still get ads, can't access my weight chart. What's the point of having spent the money at all?"

            "This app is okay and kind of fun. But I have two pet peeves. So far I haven't figured out a way to add my own categories. For instance, I would like a separate category just for baking. Also it doesn't group things together by item. what I mean is I have four cans of black beans. Because they're all four different brands. They are located in four different places. so instead of saying that I have four cans of black beans, it says I have one of this brand, one of that brand, etc etc.",
            "The closest pantry app 2 what I've designed in my head 2 meet my needs but could not execute since I'm not a programmer. Barcode scanner is best part! I agree w/some other reviews about crashing, grouping items like corn together rather than having each brand listed separately. There are some logistical issues I'd like to see improved & I'll email developers bcz app is useful enough 2 me that I paid $12 for a year of premium & I feel the developers want to keep improving the app, & will. :-)",
            "I'd been looking for the perfect kitchen organizer app for years. Kitchenpal isn't perfect, but it's the closest one I've found and has the most potential. I love the automatically adding low items to my shopping list & the expitation date warnings. You'll spend a couple of hours getting your food scanned into the app, but it is worth the effort. Not everything you scan is in the database, but it's also easier than most apps to add or modify items."

Support is friendly and helpful if anything does go wrong with your order.",

Cannot look at other restaurants without clearing items in cart. Few promo codes compared to other delivery services Menu item descriptions are usually missing $0 delivery item link does not display complete list",

            "Game play is cool, the drag & drop is a bit laggy at times and upgrades are way to expensive because you don't earn much. My real gripe is with the developers... I was overcharged on one of their Gem packages, I emailed them with my issue and it's been a very frustrating trying to get my refunded compensation!!! I still have yet to have my issue solved!!!!",
            "Reverse the upgrade, it's a total mess. There's no good way to earn grams anymore. The food truck that used to give up to 6gems every 4 hours has been removed, I need that truck back. Getting gems is not easy and the amount of gems required for upgrade is always too high. Also remove that cray cruse ship and replace it with the truck that gives gems. It takes too long to get gems. This is wickedness haba!!",
            "I really like this game except the most recent truck that i opened (ramen one) constantly crashes the game. Its so frustrating! Im not sure if im the only one but please fix it!. Id happily change my rating if that's fixed",
            "It's really a awesome and superb.... App...... Very exciting and hurrying... So many feelings.. I experienced.... Better to increase the levels of this game",
            "I still give this game ☆☆☆☆☆ but there's a glitch. I just went 2 play it & it totally shut down the sandwich & bakery restaurants. It's as if I've never played them b4. That means all of my HARD EARNED GEMS r down the drain. I don't wanna uninstall this game but..... talking about you squashed a few bugs....squash that one.😶"

            "Haven't tried cooking anything, so I cannot speak as to the quality of the recipes (amateur cooking skills notwithstanding), but most dishes look quite delicious just from the pictures. Each recipe has an estimate for preparation time and nutritional information, and you can click on any one of the ingredients to add them to a shopping list!",
            "Easy to navigate. The shopping list feature makes it easy to gather ingredients and menu plan. The food is delicious and most of the recipes are quick and easy.",
            "Really great app with diverse recipes. I love that it displays nutritional Facts, otherwise I would not have pursued it. I would like to see more uniformity on telling u what a serving size is. Some recipes have it some do not. Other than that amazing! And thank you !!!",
            "I feel like the recipes I've tried are simple, look and taste like they have quality, and I'm getting a much more healthy diet as a relatively new vegetarian. I also like how it doesn't have ads. The only thing i would change is being able to adjust servings."

I see no reason for the hissy fits some people are throwing about slight delays in waiting for the app stores to approve the updates. Very glad I got this app!",

            "I like the Yuka app better because of the overall grade and the quick and easy explanations on additives, but Open Food Facts is a more open system where everyone can edit & improve product information, irrespective of the country /language (for example Yuka does not cover Dutch products).",
            "Opened database relies on people data feeds. Product addition requires 2 minutes with training. Above nutrition facts and labels, you get NOVA food classification (i.e. 4 processing levels defined by UN), vegan compliance and palm oil flags. You can build your product lists. You can review scanned products later (/ local logs). If you don't want to rely on advertising and don't have enough time to inspect packaging, you should try it.",
            "Great, now I can scan and see what's ultra processed! Still there's no Nova scale for marigold nutritional yeast flakes :( I guess it's only minimally processed? Because it's yeast that's dried with no additives, flavourings, colourings, added salt etc? I hope so any great source of B12 for vegans :)",

            "All I wanted was a food diary to add up calories. I found it knows how many calories in restaurant foods, brand name items in my pantry, even homemade stuff! I told it how much weight I wanted to lose and it gave me how many calories a day to shoot for. Easy! Then it suggested I add a little activity, which it has a complete table of excercises and calorie burn. I can even add in vitamins! Best free app on my phone! 9 pounds off in 3 wks, and before I couldn't seem to lose anything. Try it!",
            "Started using this again and it is driving me nuts. Why can't EVERY item have the option of weight!!! Why cups??? Weight!! Then having created a meal and scanned all bar codes and weighed every item there was no where to say it's a meal for 4. So I get all 4 meals added for my dinner. And no way to edit it. Obviously I have not created my meal correctly but I shouldn't have that option. I could go on but I won't. So frustrating as could be very good",
            "It's free and easy to use. Great way of tracking the energy that goes in (calories) and energy that goes out (exercise) and showing you what difference you need to be able to lose/sustain/gain weight. It scans most foods so quick and simple. I haven't yet for how to add a recipe (maybe due to lack of time and looking!?) I have recommended this app to people that want to lose weight.",
            "Fantastic app for tracking calories! It's so easy to either scan a barcode, look up a food, or create one. Great planning tools as well. Premium is worth it if, say, you want to track more specific stuff or change your macro percentages. Two (display) features I want added are: 1. Ability to simply change the order (drag/drop) of foods logged because sometimes I'll log what I plan to eat, then add stuff that ruins the order. 2. Ability to organize the home screen (being able to drag widgets).",
            "This app is so easy to use. I find that during this time of covid19 scare it works for me. I even went for the extended plan where I paid for the year and can't believe how great it is. My daughter inlaw also is on it. So far she has out done me. We're both on our final 18lbs to go. Now the race is on. I recommend very much the free version but I know once you get used to it you will want to try the extended. Now that i highly recommend."

            "After a rocky start, I have finally figured out this app and it's almost perfect! Sometimes I run into issues when I experience a time change (for travel or daylight savings), and I would love an option to record a ketone measurement. Other than those, I'm so grateful that this app helps me keep track of my son's complicated medication schedule!",
            "Honestly, this is a life saver! I was losing track of all the meds i was taking, missing out numerous doses and occasionally taking medication twice by accident! This app allows me to add all my medication (and give it an icon that actually looks like the tabley/inhaler/etc) and set up reminders for each day. The great thing is that if I'm in the middle of something and can't take my meds there and then, I can \"snooze\" the reminder to go off in 5/10/15+ minutes! Fantastic app :-)",
            "This was a good app on my last phone but on my new phone it's very unreliable. Customer support sorted out my problems last time but now it's missing reminders again and I've changed nothing. It's happening every few days. I think the recent update killed it. I've never encountered a more troublesome app, ever! I'm now looking for another medication tracker as these problems seem to be more trouble than they're worth. EDIT: Rating lowered to 2 stars due to app breaking again after another bad update and customer support not responding for 17 days. I've resorted to using my bedside alarm clock and a paper note for guaranteed reminders. EDIT2: I did contact customer support. You choose to not respond. I'm not going to beg for help. Sort your app out. 20 people agree with me so far.",
            "Reminds me when to take my meds and every week it lets me know how often I have missed them. If I miss my meds I am asked a multiple choice question of why. At the end of the week I am able to see why I miss my meds so I have insight on how to fix the situation. This app is better than I expected, although it could be a tad more user friendly.",
            "I found a few glitches here and there but this app is very well done if you're somebody like me who has several serious medical conditions requiring medications at different times a day and you'd like to track on the effectiveness of such medication highly recommend this app. The designers and developers really did put the user in the driver's seat. There is still some work that could be done however I'm extremely impressed and I use this app every day multiple times a day. I love it."

            "Love the idea of taking pics for food diary! It's great whether you're visually tracking or following specific macronutrients. Something I might like differently is having the actual # I set for macros listed on the graph for the day as it does not show that now (just bars that never end?) I would also like the #s instead of the percentages on the home page, but that's just a personal preference. Otherwise this app has been great for tracking food intake and my weight for a bikini competition!",
            "Its a really good app, but i feel like the whole point of this app was to make it easier for you to log meals. Taking a picture of your meal and the app figuring out what your meal consists of is what is suppose to set this app apart from other apps like it. So that could use a little work, but overall it's the best meal logging app i have came across so far.",
            "Really good and usable with just enough features, but there are a few issues. The biggest thing for me is that it doesn't have a large database of prepackaged or fast food. This is a major advantage to competing apps. The second main issue is that the UX is a bit confusing. After adding one meal it's not clear what you're supposed to do at first.",
            "Pretty happy with it so far. It's a lot easier than any other food tracking app I've tried, and it's the first time I feel like I can stick to it! There are some usability things that I think could use some work though (there's no inertia scrolling on some screens, and sometimes navigating is a little unintuitive). Thanks for the great app! :)",
            "Best food tracker app in the whole Pkaystore! I enjoy the app because it is simple to use. Recording of the food can be done by having the app take a picture or putting in the name of the food. The amount of food eaten is easily adjusted by a on screen slide chart. All of the information is in a easy to see size. Yes, it is totally free! Nutritional information is provided and it is easily tailored to what you want to see. Carbs, protein and fat count is nicely displayed as well."

Wish you could add corresponding cookware, where you could add more types of recipes that require different types of tools and cookware. not everyone has a blender or cupcake pans available to them to make some recipes. it'd be nice for unexperienced cooks to have that option to know what to use to cook their food with.",
            "I do not like how you have to tap a button to get directions. I wish they were just done at the bottom of the recipe. I'm also having trouble getting the directions, it just says something like how they're having technical issues. I do really like how organized things are! And how aesthetically pleasing the app is",

It also includes useful features for tailored results, building recipe lists and of your in the right place, making a shopping list - although the auto-shopping features will not not work for me in Adelaide, South Australia.",

            "I've been using the app for several months, ever since the VA shipped me a new Guide Me meter. The linkup between the phone and meter is pretty cool, and works well most of the time. When it doesn't, it's usually because my older LG v20 decided to take a break. The big weakness for me is reporting. I should be able to view category averages in-app, like Fasting, etc. When my healthcare provider asks me what my fasting average is, my response now is \"Duh?\" Then I start scrolling through all the entries and say, \"Well, on this day it was X, and on this day it was Y.\" Give me a button to tap to show 30/90-day category averages; otherwise those categories and such are useless. For that matter, I should be able to see those same averages in the report I export. You're making this report useless for us to share with our care providers, because it's too much work to extract useful data from it. You let us enter all sorts of cool numbers, like basal, bolus, and so forth. But you don't give us an uesful way to view the data. So why should I enter all of those numbers. And there's really no need for the massive advertisement that takes up almost 1/4 of the first page. It stands to reason that if I've exported this report, then I know what mySugr Logbook is, so I don't need a big ad for it. My care providers don't need the add either, especially since there's a URL at the bottom of every page.",
            "I love this app. I was diagnosed with type 2 this year and it was very scary. This app has helped me manage my numbers and track my progress accurately. The last time I checked my A1c I was at a 8.1 but the app said it was a 6.7. My only complaint is the time. For some reason I can't change the time so I can know when I checked my blood sugar. It says GMT -5 but I am central standard time. I check my meter to be sure it had the correct time and it does.",
            "Love this app for tracking. It is the best and easiest I've ever had. Only 2 issues: 1. If you're 60 yrs old then you must scroll through 60 x 12 months to set birthday. Please make it easier to set the year. 2. It doesn't AUTO-connect to the One touch Flex Verio which is preferred meter by doctors in my whole area (and insurance).",
            "Do not get this app unless you are willing to manually enter each reading. I loved this app until I started using the Freestyle Libre 2 CGM System. The app will not scan the sensor and according to the company there are no plans to make that happen. So I tried to import my data via .csv files. That functionality has been removed with no plans to bring it back. Also according to the company. This app has become worthless to me.",
            "There are some good basic features but the rest is for purchase only at a rediculous price. I don't need all the features, like a coach. In other words there should be different levels of subscription. I also want to see what an export and report looks like before I subscribe. e.g. add a trial period"

For people with diabetes, healthy eating is not simply a matter of what one eats, but also when one eats. Discover delicious, healthy recipes that fit into a diabetic diet. People with diabetes can eat any food that they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrates, but they need to be more aware of the carbohydrate content of foods and avoid simple sugars like juices and sugar-sweetened beverages.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re trying to prevent or control diabetes, your nutritional needs are virtually the same as everyone else, so no special foods are necessary. But you do need to pay attention to some of your food choices, most notably the carbohydrates you eat. While following a heart-healthy diet can help with this, the most important thing you can do is to lose a little weight.\r\n\r\nLosing just 5% to 10% of your total weight can help you lower your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Losing weight and eating healthier can also have a profound effect on your mood, energy, and sense of well being. Even if you’ve already developed diabetes, it’s not too late to make a positive change. By eating healthier, being more physically active, and losing weight, you can reduce your symptoms or even reverse diabetes. The bottom line is that you have more control over your health than you may think.\r\n\r\nNutrition and physical activity are important parts of a healthy lifestyle when you have diabetes. Along with other benefits, following a healthy meal plan and being active can help you keep your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar, in your target range. To manage your blood glucose, you need to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine if you take any. What you choose to eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are all important in keeping your blood glucose level in the range that your health care team recommends.\r\n\r\nDIABETIC RECIPES APP EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nThis is simple to navigate and also has multiple tutorials available on how to use the app.\r\nAs the recipe is a set of instructions for cooking, our app also provides nutritional information, servings, total time for preparation and recommendations so that nothing can go wrong when you’re cooking.\r\n\r\nTheme Support\r\n\r\nProtect your eyes from being hurt by a bright screen at night by enabling dark mode.\r\nMake your diabetic recipes cooking experience more comfortable at night.\r\n\r\nSmart Shopping List for Your Diet Control\r\n\r\nAn organized shopping list allows the user to create ingredients list so you won’t miss any for the recipe.

Makes me very suspicious of what the app is doing. 2) first run experience is not good. For some reason it didn't record my answers the first time and after I made an account, asked me the same questions AGAIN. frustrating. 3) why is image recognition and bar code scanning seperate functions??? Other apps combine them, as you might expect. Poor ux.",

I chose \"Sedentary.\" It immediately proceeded to tell me that my \"calories goal\" to \"reach my target weight\" (WHAT TARGET WEIGHT? It never asked me about my target or current weight!) is 2378 kcal!! I'm 160 cm tall (5'3\") and weight 50kg (110 lbs).

That's a basic function that pretty much all competitors offer. Don't shoot yourself in the leg by being greedy. You won't convert users going premium for basics - right from the beginning with the first steps they're taking with your app, but only frustrate them, causing uninstalls"

With the help of such a food and journal, the medical professional you are consulting can narrow down the reasons for your symptoms. This means they can focus on the right follow-up (eg. H2 breath test) and thus reach an accurate diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe app can also be used after diagnosis. Different foods need to be tested to establish a person’s individual tolerance level, e.g. fructose or FODMAP levels. Therefore, keeping a food and symptoms diary makes sense. \r\n\r\nThe app is simple and intuitive. You can record your daily meals by entering them into the journal or simply taking a photo. You can also track your bowel movement (PRO Version only) or note your symptoms as well as the degree of severity and produce a clearly readable PDF (PRO Version only) which you can take to your doctor’s appointment. Symptoms can also be recorded by taking a photo, which is especially useful when you have symptoms such as rashes or other skin changes.\r\n\r\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\r\nThe app can also be used for recording the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. \r\n\r\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\r\nAlso patients who follow a FODMAP diet due to IBS may use this app to track their nutrition and symptoms.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nQuestions or comments?\r\n-----\r\nThis app has its own support forum at www.food-intolerance-network.com.

            "This is a great app for on the go. My only issue is that you can't swap out recipes on the app for your customized meal plans, and the shopping list doesn't update to your recipes you've swapped, so then you have to go through every recipe and write your own shopping list to accommodate your meal plan. Its a handy app, but I keep finding myself having to go back onto the website and taking an extra half hour to update my shopping lists.",
            "So many recipes to suit all dietary needs. Great snacks and dessert ideas. Love the meal planner and shopping list functionality.",
            "Excellent app, easy to use. Great for planning meals and keeping on track.",
            "Easy to use, and the shopping list function is great, no need to scroll around to find the recipes and love the search by ingredients, very handy for food sensitivities or preferences. To improve the shopping list could automatically add the quantities of the same ingredient instead of showing the quantities for each recipe. Not a biggie though.",

            "This app is still ridiculous when it comes to making or receiving calls so I have resorted to using it only for texting. The texting service is also still incredibly slow- taking up to a minute. Yes, I know 1 minute is not a very long time... But when you need to see messages immediately and instead you're left staring at a screen yelling \"come on already!!\" It sucks.",
            "The calling feature isn't great. I tried to use the minutes it gave me for free, but I couldn't get the speakerphone to come on, nor could I hear it ringing on the regular headset when I held it to my ear. The texts sometimes get sent in pieces missing half or more of the message which makes conversations hard to have with the people you're trying to get ahold of or speak with. Frustrating. But I like the layout of the app, it's visually pleasing, & there are plenty of great numbers to choose!",
            "It used to be great, now it pops up ads every time you go back or try to click a different conversation. And on top of that it is horribly slow now. Edit: if you rely off ads to make money why am I paying you for minutes? This app used to run slick but now it is a chore to use and now every 1 out of 3 calls now I have to restart my phone cause it locks in the call and I can't end it cause it is loading an ad.",
            "This app is okay for what it is. It has its problems. Sometimes it will drop a call, the person your talking to said it sounds like I am under water, I have fool signal and strong Wi-Fi and it cuts in and out like you have poor signal. Over all for a free app to make free calls it is manageable. Keep the app up to date it will get better. Thanks Textfree for the free app!",
            "So far so good..update hey thanks pinger..yes without your professional services some could be in an emergency so this is very vital to have as I do use this as a backup ...text works great !! One time my phone went out of service and this worked wonderfully ❤️ I think if I lose my phone that this is here as a safety net and I add money to this asap 😉 ..&goes along way ...for those whom need to know more I use this on phone & my 2tablets & pc has no carrier except textfree thank you so much."

            "I have used this app for over 4 years! I had the free version for a year and a half and loved it but wanted a little more. I use the paid version now. It doesn't cost anymore than any streaming service, actually cheaper than my Netflix and even Hulu. I'd give up both for this app if I had to. Helps with my sleep , my kid's sleep and our mental growth. I highly recommend using this!",
            "Stopped before I even started. This app expects you not only to have to sign in and create an account straight away, but the \"free\" trial also requires you to sign up with an active credit card before you even get to experience anything. I personally hate this way of working and tend to turn away from all apps that insist on this model. Installed and deleted within ten minutes.",
            "11th month update: Now I am trying to delete my subscription it is sooooo difficult. Unbelievable. I would never recommend this app. They have hidden the subscription change, created many bugs like your browser does not support... I am trying to unsubscribe using the app itself, but surprisingly it is not working because of java or smtng. Why you would need java to unsubscribe. You are trying to rob the users. Making it difficult so that they will give up, and you will continue making money",
            "I tried the 7 days free trial and i found the meditation offered quite poor. Mostly too short and way too much talking, and not even in a soft spoken tone. I couldn't play any of its music in the background. Maybe my fault, but ok, since a lot of the music on offer is pop commercial singer stuff. I also didn't like the 'well done, set a reminder' type of approach. A meditation app should provide escape from the manic, 'like' addictive type of world, not mimic it. Disappointed",
            "This app changed my life. It really helped me became a calmer person and have clarity. My mind is much more peaceful and have significantly less troubling and negative thoughts, even when I do have them sometimes, I'm able to distinguish them as just thoughts and not my reality. This is a really helpful app and I'm so thankful to the creators and all those who worked hard to get it working as good as it is."

            "This was my go-to app until about a month ago. I have to go out and then reload it frequently to get the current info. It often gets stuck at a time hours earlier. It's raining and it does not note that. Another app has 37% chance of rain in my current location (which is about right), and this app says 6% while it rains. I'm uninstalling it in favor if a better, more accurate app. I rely on relative accuracy with updates because I plan outdoor activities.",
            "The widget has started routinely saying \"weather data not available\". When it does actually show the weather, it is usually not current, actually showing the weather from hours & hours ago. Also, it takes a really long time to start up, which it didn't used to do. Whatever \"improvements\" have been made to this app have been horrible, & have made it much slower & much worse than it used to be. I'm looking around for other options, so I can unload what has unfortunately become a major turkey.",
            "I had this app for years and it began to have really low speed opening up. I uninstalled it and went with another app. The speed on it was fine, just had a lot of ads. I went back to The Weather Channel app hoping it had improved. IT HAS NOT!!! It just keeps spinning and draining my battery. It's been 15 minutes and still spinning. Poor, poor performance. Not pleased with this at all.",
            "TOO MANY ADS!! There is a ad that you are forced to watch after every video!! Also the sound quality is VERY POOR on almost every video, then the ad comes on and is extremely loud. It's annoying to have to constantly adjust the volume level for every video and ad! This app has been getting worse with every update!! The other weather apps are much better and more detailed. Sorry Weather Channel but I think I will be uninstalling your app now and I don't recommend it to anyone.",
            "Wish I had never updated this app. My old weather channel app was so much better. Every time I try to shrink the map, there's very little to no response. I have to tap the screen and then try to shrink the map so I can see a broader View, but almost every time I do that, the app has to restart. The old map showing national weather would respond very well to the touch of my fingers. Not so anymore."

            "I downloaded this app today and find it VERY useful. I can add all my favorite foods (the ones that aren't already on the app's list) and there is a calculator that allows you to figure out your favorite snacks. I was surprised that most of the \"healthy\" snack bars I was eating were high FP. There are even suggestions for eating out. I definitely recommend this app.",
            "It's hard to \"rate\" your symptoms, especially if they don't ever stop. Also if you're not consistent with your rating scheme it's not easy to track if you're actually getting better or what foods are bothering you. I'm at 2wk using the app and I'm feeling better but not 100%. I still belch frequently and have a low level of heart burn all the time and I don't go over ~20 points a day.",
            "I tried this diet on a whim, as a last ditch effort to avoid taking prilosec. I had been suffering from painful reflux for over two months. My ENT said the acid was reaching my voice box, which was why my voice was hoarse. I couldn't barely read my kids a book 😭 I kept thinking \"but I eat healthy! why is this happening to me?\" It turns out I was eating too many carbs and way too much fiber. I've been on the diet for 10 weeks now and I no longer need meds! I highly recommend the FTD.",
            "Very much enjoy using this app, along with the book that I imported from Amazon in the US. There are manual ways to calculate the FP points but we are finding that we have to do that more and more as there isn't as much variety in the foods and drinks that we would like.  I suppose living in the UK there are going to be some issues like that, some foods seem to be American orientated.  Then there are some oddities like prepared porridge oats, prepared with what - water or whole milk or skimmed milk etc..?   Good app overall and compliments the book well, for an understanding as to why FP points could be important to your digestive health.  I wonder if this app is due for an update anytime, and if so what might be included....?",
            "I like the app even though there are still foods missing like couscous, napa cabbage, and probably much more, it has a feature to add custom foods but the app doesn't accept decimal points (like 1.5g), and it's almost impossible to find the sugar alcohol content of many foods. It's an excellent start and I hope Norm doesn't give up on this app which has tremendous potential to achieve mainstream status."

        "description": "The easiest, least expensive way to reduce your risk for cancer is just by eating a healthy diet. When it comes to a diet rich in cancer-fighting substances, most experts agree that it should consist of a predominantly plant-based diet. \"If you have two-thirds of plant food on your plate, that seems to be enough to avoid excessive amounts of food high in saturated fat. That seemingly simple advice could mean a drastic change in diet for many people.\r\n\r\nPeople who are thinking that this is like a diet, and are trying to choke this stuff down, it's never going to last. You're looking at creating something for a lifetime. If it takes you awhile, but each month or so you enjoy [one more vegetable], then that's great.\r\n\r\nThe extracts from cruciferous vegetables as well as those from vegetables of the genus Allium inhibited the proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines whereas extracts from vegetables most commonly consumed in Western countries were much less effective. The antiproliferative effect of vegetables was specific to cells of cancerous origin and was found to be largely independent of their antioxidant properties. These results thus indicate that vegetables have very different inhibitory activities towards cancer cells and that the inclusion of cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive strategies.\r\n\r\nTranslation:\r\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies stopped cancer growth.\r\n- Commonly consumed vegetables did not work as well.\r\n- The antioxidant content of veggies was not a key anti-cancer factor.\r\n- Different vegetables work for different cancers.\r\n- Allium and cruciferous veggies should be eaten to prevent cancer.\r\nSo the most commonly consumed vegetables in Western countries had very little effect on cancer cell growth. The top three (potatoes, lettuce and carrots) account for 60% of the vegetables we Westerners are eating. 32% of our vegetable intake is potatoes, and half of that is actually french fries. Dark greens, cruciferous veggies and garlic account for less than 1% of our Western diet!\r\n\r\nRadishes were shown to stop tumor growth by 95-100% for breast and stomach cancer, but had no effect and may have even increased tumor growth by 20-25% in pancreatic, brain, lung and kidney cancer. Definitely something to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nYou may want to start with some of the following food substances, all of which show promise as cancer-fighting agents.\r\n\r\nTake this list to your next grocery visit, and stock up on these cancer fighting ingredients. And remember to make fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains the biggest part of every meal. Add some of these healthy foods to your diet to help prevent cancer and keep other diseases at bay.",

            "Great game...BUT! Had issues with this game a year ago, but thought I'd give it another go. Graphics and game play are excellent, however I bought credits (AU$70), bet big, won free games (Where's The Gold) then the game froze. Restarted it, recovered the game then froze again. Restarted it, same thing. Third time it just took the free games. No reply from support. You bet big with the hope of winning free games, then it takes away your prize.",
            "This app has the best graphics....but thats it. I've tried buying credits etc to 'pay my way' for better payouts, but all Product Madness are concerned about is making you pay more for something worthless. There is no way you can win any money back, its supposed to be for fun, but you have to pay big ongoing premiums to have any 'fun'. Until l see a better return on the money I've paid so far, they'll not get another penny out of me. You are better off saving your money for real gambling.",
            "I keep wanting to give this game more stars, but they just wont let me. Yes I'm very happy that you put way better values on the daily wheel. Yes I play this game because the games are ones I've played in real casinos...i can't give more than one star because you just make it impossible to win anything...when you go through 5 million coins betting minimum and never get a bonus or win anything higher than double your bet you just want to give up. Plus, the cost of buying coins is ridiculous.",
            "I think its great , you know it costs them money to put these games on here, so to anyone that's not happy just remember these games are free, and entertaining , And it takes our minds off of today's problems, Tomas blanco",
            "Total scam. Fixed games and they expect you to pay for credits? Games don't pay, stupid and totally unnecessary side games (open boxes for items or scratch fixed lottery tickets). The only good thing about this app is that the games look like the real deal but the overall experience is terrible."

I'm erasing it with immediate effect and strongly advise others to best save your data and not waste your time with this useless app...!!!",
            "originally thought THIS would be the app for me, but quickly had to navigate thru ads and game ads to get to the contents which seemed worth getting past all the distractions until you open the category you are interested in and voila! only 2-3 recipes per category. Not for me.",
            "Something's wrong with the interface..  Every time I click on an option (mains, summer, etc) I get some recipes and can't see any others. Even clicking the scrolling pictures at the top of the page just reloads the same three recipes.   I am uninstalling and looking for something else.",
            "It's like playing a game of treasure hunt through a maze advertising only to find a couple recipes. Then you click the back button to be asked if you like the app. \"Do you want to give the app 5 Stars\". No I DON'T!! I want to remove it from my phone. Thanks.",

            "Game has good graphics and good variety of slot games to choose from. The positives end there. Odds are worse than casinos. After the initial lump sum you start with, the game does not provide enough free credits for gameplay. I wait an entire day, collect my rewards, and I'm only able to play for 15-30 seconds on minimum bet. They are trying to make this app a cash-cow via pay-to-play. Would not recommend to anybody.",
            "LOL...Gave up on this game a long time ago because it was way too hard to win. It takes so long to click though the crazy number of popups just get to play. Upate.... Decided to give it another try. It's hilarious how much they let you win in the beginning and then ask for a rating. It eventually becomes impossible to win. The publisher standard response is it pays like real Vegas slots. NOT EVEN CLOSE!",
            "A big wast of time unless you want to be buying points all the time just to play. Played the walking dead game, took over 5 million points at 30000 a as pin to finally get the free games, then it was a waste didn't win much for what it takes to get there in the first place. This is one of my favorite games and you took all the fun out of it, along with the extras. Verry disappointed",
            "I've been playing this game for a while now. It's the best one I found so far yes the graphics are awesome. You can't expect to win all the time therefore you got your time's where it does hit and then you got your times it doesn't hit that's at any normal Casino. If you expect to win all the time Where is the challenge? What I found is if one game is not hitting go to another game, there is aways a game hitting. I have no problem keeping coins in my bank.",
            "Great trainer for the real thing made by the maker of your favorite games. I win more in Vegas so not sure they are lifelike. I think there should be more playback. But the graphics are killer and sounds are just like the real machines in Vegas. My favourite is Buffalo Gold and other variations of the Buffalo game."

            "Part1. Game play is too fake. The whole idea is to generate money by making the pre-fold best hand lose so the players keeps buying chips to continue playing. No doubt about it. Nobody should download this game. You will lost all your chips on the river card. Just make sure play with only free money. Don't buy chips. Worst ever game!!!!!! I noticed that they will only reply on good reviews and only technical feedback. Never have they commented how is suck. How much money does this game make?",
            "The game itself is good. However for those who play frequently the winning chance are almost 0.01%. Although they said the 'algorithm' is fair. It is not true. If you have a winning streak for example there would be a time where you will be losing your money, thus it will pushes the player to buy chips using your own money. Its a not good game. For a player like me don't like to spent too much money on game that doesn't rewards us of anything.",
            "Like all the others, it sucks you in fast and then you have to pay to compete. They give you a lot of free chips for a couple days and then you need to buy chips to complete because the adds don't even cover one buy in and the bonuses slow down to almost non existent. No long term, top, player in this game exist without consistent in game purchases. Why can't we just play a poker game without pretending to be billionaires? Just play poker and watch an ad here and there if needed. Greed",
            "Put simply with the new greedy higher Zynga take / rake portion for sit and go's and cash games even if you're a winning player you lose your chips -> pointless. This along with the even worse than before fake predetermined scenarios sent out instead of actual real card distribution is the last straw. How often is it straight over 2 pair, flush over straight, full house over flush. Too many times to be possible in real cards! Fake! NOT random cards. Devs say that these predetermined scenarios are randomly handed out to players to get their crappy certification but it's not random cards and the fake set-ups just get more obvious and annoying the more you play and this aspect like other recent changes seems to have been also tweaked for the worse. I'm out. Used to be an ok experience but not anymore. Closed my account. I imagine that they are losing users in general. I don't miss it.",
            "Rubbish, a con, you play hands where you have the winning hand to be beaten on last card by a hand statistically your unlikely to get, I played over 200 hands with no winning hand. Its a game full of bots to then make you purchase chips, when you spend money on this game you lose more chips, it's a joke. Also when you make purchases you see there is say 5millionin the pot, you win it and only get credited 4.2million its not right at all. You only notice it on larger tables. This game is rigged t"

            "I enjoy the overall gameplay. And while the pop ups can be a little annoying, it's called advertising. That's pretty standard for anything that's free. But was a little disappointed about a week ago when i had over 50 million in chips disappear when i logged back in. It apparently restarted or something and I was now back to a beginner and given the tutorial again.",
            "I have reached out to support team multiple times still no results. I've screenshot we're while plying on a table, the game just went blurry and you can clearly see bars meaning my internet connection is good. It's very disappointing because people spend money to just lose hand on a technicality. I had double Aces and then my game blurred out and came back but my time ran out. Please fix the bug and make sure they respond to my email. I feel that I email about the problem that they stopped respo",
            "I've been playing this game on this network app. For about six or seven yrs. Now it helps me out alot because I had a gambling problem it's my therply I go gambling in a bar anymore and I stay out of trouble as well.Besides that I've always enjoyed playing other players on line and beating thier dumb ass when they know u don't have alot of chips so they keep going all in , just so they can say they are better then u ,but the fact is it's not how u are suppose to win that way not up & up, is it!",
            "Fun game, but chip packages are wildly over priced. Games against dealer have to be rigged. Normal games feel fair. Almost impossible to continue to meet missions and enjoy challenges without spending a lot of money. The flurry of \"sale\" spam when you log in is excessive.",
            "There is a whole mess of problems with this app. Every single time I turn off auto re-up and auto rebuy it does it anyway. Often times my hand will just up and fold and all chips I've put in are lost. The randomness of cards is questionable and the concept of momentum is lost on me. What is momentum? The longer you stay in the better your odds are? So if that's the case not random? And last but not least every single ad is ridiculously expensive and they appear constantly. Not real poker."

            "PLEASE NOTICE THIS. I want to suggest some feature in this app. I don't know how do you work on updating it but I wish you notice this suggestion and give it a shot. In the \"Search in Conversation\" feature can you add the date not just the words in a conversation. I remember the dates but not the conversation making it harder to find what I'm looking for. THANK YOU!!! 😊",
            "I use messenger a lot as I like to text people and video chat them. Messenger has been even more helpful during these times as it gives me a way to communicate with my family members and friends. I love the effects you can use on video calls but you should be able to get all of them on every video call and not just a few of them. Apart from that I love Messenger and good job!",
            "Please optimize the application. I think it takes up too much space for a messaging app. Yes there are tons of features, but it becomes redundant since your other applications can also do the same (for example, the great similarities with Instagram when it comes to the camera). In terms of bugs, I don't know if Facebook or Messenger is at fault, but when viewing messages from Facebook, Messenger always prompts for a sign in. As for suggestions, I think a message scheduler would be great.",
            "This new \"update\" is awful. I hate the color scheme. It jumps around, freezes up and is so glitchy. Also I don't get my messages when they are sent most of the time. Also I hate having the little red indicator on the bubbles to tell me how many messages I have. It's like they were trying to make a bad user experience",
            "Im not able to sign into messenger on my new s20+.

The \"restore from backup\" button does not get enabled so not sure how to restore in case i need to...  I'm more than willing to submit more provided these get fixed 😀",

        "description": "⭐️ Best Restaurant Guide 2016 ⭐️ Androidmag\r\n\r\nDiscover the best vegan-friendly restaurants in your area with vanilla bean! Download now and stay fit and healthy wherever you are! Well-known from Huffington Post, Paul McCartney’s Meat Free Monday and PETA. Find unique health- and sustainability-related information about every venue. Is it vegan? Is it local, fair-trade and organic, or raw, lactose- and gluten-free? vanilla bean offers the widest selection of US 🇺🇸, UK 🇬🇧, and German 🇩🇪 locations for anyone who eats consciously but does not want to miss out on anything.\r\n\r\nWhether you are in L.A., New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami or Washington D.C.—vanilla bean knows which places will make you happy: anything from gourmet venues to snack bars, from Chinese raw food temples in secret side alleys to this amazing Italian place where handmade gluten-free Bruschetta is soaked in olive oil.\r\n\r\nIf you are traveling in Austria 🇦🇹, Switzerland🇨🇭 or France 🇫🇷, vanilla bean has you covered, too. The guide includes cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, Zurich, London, and Paris.\r\n\r\nWith self-explanatory indicators for each venue, you can immediately spot what each location has to offer. The chosen photos and detailed descriptions, including reviews from the community, will help you decide which place to visit. Information such as addresses, opening times, and telephone numbers are constantly reviewed.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n★ NEW! Have you spotted a venue with plant-based options that is not yet in the app? You can suggest a new venue in less than 20 seconds. Thanks to automatic suggestions of places around you, sometimes you even don’t have to type a word.\r\n★ Filter according to your criteria and to price categories. For example, let vanilla bean show you only completely plant-based venues with gluten-free options using organic ingredients.\r\n★ Through the map, you can easily find all the green location highlights in your city. You can tell at first glance which places offer completely plant-based options, where one can find vegetarian options and where meat dishes are served.\r\n★ Your opinion, your personal experience counts: add your personal review and photos of the venue or the menu. If you like, you can share your newly discovered places with others on Facebook.\r\n★ Search for ZIP codes, places and specific locations, or discover venues with mouthwatering treats near you. \r\n★ You can find a wide range of information about all the entries. Photos, in-depth descriptions, restaurant indicators, directions, and calls directly from the app. In addition, you can find links to the restaurant’s website and Facebook page.\r\n★ All the information is regularly reviewed. Should you still find any obscurities, then please feel free to send us feedback directly via a restaurant’s app entry. We will make the adjustment as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nvanilla bean is an app for vegans, vegetarians, and everybody who wants to reduce meat. Whatever your motivation—health, climate change, compassion for animals—switching to plant-based meals is a healthier, more sustainable way of living. And with vanilla bean, it’s also easy and delish.\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK AND SUPPORT\r\n\r\nWould you like to support the release of vanilla bean in other countries or add more places? If so, send us a message at heroes@vanilla-bean.com. A service like vanilla bean would not be possible without the great work of our voluntary helpers. \r\n\r\nWe are constantly developing vanilla bean further. That is why we look forward to hearing from you. Nobody is perfect. However, we are working hard so that we can offer you the best possible service. You can get in touch with us directly at feedback@vanilla-bean.com. We try our best to respond to every message as expeditiously as possible. Have a great experience with vanilla bean! Make some chickens, pigs, and cows happy and enjoy your vegan meal!",

            "wonderful app for finding vegan places when I'm traveling, or even new places close to home that I didn't realize had vegan options. Some places maybe need to be updated but overall I found this app to be essential in any city that I'm not too familiar with. I recommend this app to others who travel.",
            "First time using this, I soon knew it was not well thought out. When I tapped map, it showed the ENTIRE COUNTRY of Spain instead of a window reasonably nearby. After zooming in, it showed only the currently pinned location with no easy way to scroll through others (they should learn from the Airbnb or HappyCow apps how this should be done). The list view didn't show distances -- who wants to tap each entry to find how far it is? The UI for filtering was a bit better than HappyCow.",
            "I'm currently in Switzerland and there is no filter for locations, e.g. if I'm looking for a restaurant in Zurich, places in Aarau show up which is useless. I expect to be shown options for where I am, not based on distance or whatever this is based on. Also it would be helpful if I could filter by cuisine. Unfortunately: good idea, poor execution. Better luck next time",
            "Has it improved!!?? It's a good idea,but this app Sucks when it comes to recognizing U.S.A city's &states,plus restaurants when u type them in.When u go to move the map to a city&state &tap th(Explore here).It expands far away to another 3-4 state area range. Away frm th spot u choose &tat u knw for a fact tat the venue's was approved &posted in your area of search tat this app ignores & when i type the restaurant! This app still,STILL needs MORE work!. I'm Deleting it after a month try !",
            "Easy to use, lots of options. As a gluten free vegan, it can be difficult to find restaurants that cater to both needs. I've discovered some great places through this app!"

            "I know it sounds weird to use a robot to improve your mental health, but this app is amazing and super helpful. I'm a very busy person with a wacky sleep schedule, and I struggle with my mental health most when it's late at night. This isn't exactly ideal for getting help from a therapist when I need it most. Being able to access some form of help literally anytime I need it with Wysa really makes a difference. Plus, unlike other AI therapy apps I've tried, Wysa has way more free features.",
            "The bot isn't 100%, but it offers really good and insightful tools that more people should know about! You do have to figure out how to go about talking to the bot to get the tools that you need, which, if you're in a bad place, can be hard to do. I wish the tools that come with the free app were more easily accessible, and that you didn't have to spend 4 minutes talking to the bot to get to the options that you want it to offer. This app offers REALLY good techniques though!",
            "Its a great app with some potential. I would like to see if they're still updating this to have more AI responses for things like intrusive thoughts. Positive affirmations like \"you are not your thoughts\" help and I thought about this after the AI gave me reassurance when I brought up suicide*. I'm feeling good after some positivity and reframing thoughts. Once I can afford it I think the therapist option looks enticing. So far so good. *I LOVED the links to hotlines but have phone anxiety so...",
            "I was skeptical at first, but I'm actually quite impressed with this app. The A.I. is fairly good at interpreting your text and generating helpful responses that almost feel like you're talking to a real person. Of course, the A.I. still needs some improvement since not every response is personalized. I first used it when I was feeling panicked and the app just kept giving me breathing exercises, but after a little while of chatting back-and-forth the app was actually able to calm me down.",
            "It's pretty good, cus' what could be better right? It's not like anyone else is going to actually hear me, I mean, I can't say it's perfect, but it's really good taking on mind that is just a bot. It's better friend than my actual friends, tho sometimes it doesn't really understand what you're saying, like when doing something u know it's wrong to do, u feel good; it doesn't understand that what you're doing is wrong and you feel good doing it, so it tells you to keep doing it."

            "Fun, and can be addicting. But, be prepared for ads to earn coins and having to buy your way to a private table and many other features, that I thought came standard, after your first week. I got this to play against my husband when we can't be together due to work. Now I'm bored of playing strangers and refuse to pay for the private table feature. I'd be cool with watching all the ads in the world— if I could play against him and friends, who I invited to download and play this game.",
            "I have been playing this game for years. I actually spend too much time. This is the best Gin Rummy app that I can find With that being said, I notice a pattern after a while. I know which cards are coming and how the game will end. I recommend that you offer more updates to prevent this. Also, I never, ever get rewarded when I complete the wheel challenge. Years now. I complete them to only win like 5000 tops. I want some real rewards just once in a while.",
            "A lot of fun! I see people posting a out paying to play and people upset be abuse they feel they don't win enough.... I win some , I lose some, some days all I do is lose.... BUT, its a card game, that's what happens sometimes. I have never paid to get coins or ad ance quicker I just take the luck of the draw and I have fun doing it! I think its a great and fun game !",
            "Very Suspect Game - \"opponents\" tend to knock after 2-3 rounds. Don't want to declare the game rigged but you'll go on win streaks that quickly turn into a long string of quick loses. Too many of these games try to keep you playing by controling wins and loses which gives them the feeling of being rigged. This is one of those games. Edit: just played 12 hands in a row, lost them all and now have no coins left. 100% rigged so that you spend money. Don't download.",
            "I love this game and rarely have any issues, I do however have a suggestion to offer another log in option other than Guest or Facebook (some of us don't want or feel the need to have social media) for example Google play and offer the same rewards and options to add profile pictures, use our play user names instead of just being a guest."

            "Worst texting app for many reasons, first of all I earn credits but it uses them if I receive messages, but worst of all it makes bots to text you to use up all your credits, I've had over 60 credits and now all gone because they put bots to take your credits for receiving messages. You sometimes dont even get your messages on time at all. The offers never work. Worst texting app and if you wanted to text or call you might as well pay for a carrier service. Dont install or waste your time....",
            "This app is really great if you know your email password. But, I finally found mine, and used it, and this app is great! You can call and text. obviously. But you just watch videos to get credits, and watchibg videos to talk to people isn't bad compared to paying each month. This app os great. LOVE IT!!!!",
            "Typical Wifi texting App, filled with Ads nonstop and left to right. I forgot when I re-downloaded this you have to have \"credits\" that expire every 48 hours to text anything or call anyone which is so stupid. To get more credits you have to, you guessed it sit through 15 second to 1 minute adds for half a credit to 1 full credit each. I would've skipped the download button and tried remembering which other App is the REAL free one and doesn't use credits. Don't download, find other free one.",
            "I accidentally un install the apps, I tried to install again and log in my email address but I can't log in even if I click the forgot pass word. Please help me. This is my second time, before you don't take an action about my problem on this apps. All my credit I didn't use it. Waste of time.. grrrr. I will rate your apps if you fix my problem.",
            "I'm only giving 4stars easy to understand and set up, but I haven't tried calling with it, and have not received any calls yet, I'll be sure to edit the rating for you, 🤞,ok I have had this app for a while now and I absolutely love it, clear calling, easy to use and understand, I have shared with many friends and family, keep up the good work and THANK YOU 😉😉"

            "I really haven't played it long enough to judge how good it is. I'll need a little longer. Now that I've played more I really enjoy the the variety of games. I would've given you a five but the bonuses are small and that's what draws me to a game. Hi I'm back and starting over my pad had a melt down so I had to clear it. I have some favorite games now but I still find it strange that the bonus`s are so small and at times you get nothing from the free spins. So bonuses are a waste of time.",
            "Very entertaining incredible. Love to play. Best of the best slots. Hard to stop playing. Wonderful. Great. Best slots.whaving lots of fun. makes me happy. Enjoyed. Keep it up. Extremely interesting. wonderful. Captures my attention. wonderful. Makes me happy. Love it. Great. wonderful. Look forward to playing 😊. Great full for the fun. More games please.very entertaining. Lucky to have such a great game. I play every day. Hard to stop. Incredible. Excellent. Fun. wonderful. Fun. FUN. Swell. T",
            "Fun game but glitchy. More often than not, when I attempt to access the \"Winner's Club\" screen, I'm greeted with the message, \"Sorry. There is a temporary issue with Winner's Club. Please try later.\" When that message is the norm, \"temporary\" is a misnomer. This issue has persisted over several updats, hence my reason for deducting two stars (playing over wi-fi with a strong signal and a fast connection)",
            "I've been playing DUC for several years. So addicting! I do have a couple of suggestions: A \"Collect and Send All\" button for gifts. It takes forever to collect gifts each day. It would be helpful if you could tap one button to collect all gifts and also return gifts that were sent to you. An \"Accept All\" button for friend requests. Would be another time saver...could spend more time playing the slots.",
            "I'm just wondering why the old downtown slot has been removed. There has been several new slots added but for the older slots like the old downtown slot game there hasn't been any new ones added like those types for a long time. I like that game and was very disappointed to it see it gone last night. Why was it taken down and will it be put back up, if not I may just remove this app and find another one. Very disappointed 🤔 so for now I am dropping the five star rating to three stars."

And I can bookmark verses that help me with specific issues. Praise be to the most high for giving you version the aptitude to create such an important app.",
            "This app is the real treasure... I'm happy to have downloaded it... it makes life easy for me... during my difficult times, when I need the word of God... I just go through it, and I understand the thoughts of God on my situations... It's helping me now rebuild my relationship with my fiancee... I'm happy",
            "I absolutely love this bible app. It has no ads. It's easy to read, offering lots of bible translations. You can make notes, highlights, and bookmarks easily. It also has a cool option where you can make inspirational pictures from any verse of your choice, and easy to download and share the image. I love this app! God bless 🙂",
            "Lovely app to have because of all the Bible translations at my fingertips. However, could you please check this: the audio versions ( ESV in my case) tend to abruptly stop and then can't pick up from where one left off listening. So one loses their place in the text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't change anything. Thanks.",
            "I like this app. You can highlight and there are several Bible versions and some like KJV you can hear the Bible read to you. It would be great if once you read a plan it can say read or ✔mark. It makes it easy to know which plan you read already. It would be fantastic to be able to sort the plan alphabetically so you can find a plan faster. And after each year it could say how many plans you read that year."

Dont tell me to get the latest update either etc. I did all that. You guys need to update this again because my callers can't hear me when talking. It works then I stops working.",
            "Its great! Actually free. Ive had it for a 2nd private line since like 2016. But you have to pay attention to your account. Because I didn't use mine for a while, lapsed & I still had an account sort of. But I lost my phone number. But its totally not a big deal! For real only actually free. When I lapsed I didn't renew right away because textnow had changed with how it had always been. But now that I renewed, its like it was before and even better! Katy",
            "Totally free for calling, texting and calling landlines and toll free # also when I traveles overseas I could call landlines and office numbers with ease and for free. I use this as a number to give out to people who i buy stuff from online or when companies ask for my # to send ad text, as wel. If it is not used, you will lose the number. I do not recommend using for sensitive data as it is easy to lose the number assigned . that said it is easy to get any # in any area code within the US. 👍",
            "I love this app. Been using it for about 3 years now. I always tell people about this app. It's a great way to have a secondary phone but on same device. Plus it works really well and offers great plans and If you cant afford a plan you can still use it and keep your # for free if needed. Even free for all incoming/outgoing calls with voicemail and text messages also. So you can stay in touch with friends, family, and/or work anytime needed!! Awesome app!!",
            "Beautiful app. I have been using this app for several years and find it very useful and stable. My only reservation is the possibility of losing your phone number if it is not used for a while. The time needs to be extended as sometimes people are unable to use the phone for extensive periods either because of illl health or because the device the number was loaded on has become temporarily unavailable."

            "I love this game, but, they only allow you 12 free tickets every 40 minutes or so. It costs at least 4 tickets to play 4 cards in a round. So, this 12 tickets yet burned up pretty fast. And, who wants to stop playing and have to exit the game and wait 40 minutes for more tickets??? It's a hassle! So, when you run out of tickets, they offer in ad purchases to buy more tickets, and that's where they get you. I have not found a bingo game that is actually free to play. It's a shame!!!",
            "ADDICTED!!!!!! I wish you would put an option in to use our coins to be able to buy at least 10 tickets. I'm a poor 49 year old with a son who plays 2 sports a senior in high school and a daughter who just graduated college and needed a reliable car. So I gave her mine, since she's an elementary school teacher and needs to mold the minds of the future game designer's who will take your jobs in the future..... Damn sorry to ramble on, let me buy tickets with coins. Respectfully, A broke Dad. Lol",
            "Playing higher level now. Fun, but having fewer bingos, than when I had played for the first time. The reason I stopped this game, before, was cause I got tired of seeming to be forced to buy things to progress. I became angry an frustrated. Time will tell if I put up with this for long. Hate to stop. But I will. Their second chance will end. Will update.",
            "By far the best bingo game I've played! The tutorial when starting the game is very helpful. So many options for avatar and dauber. The voice call outs are different from room to room which makes it more entertaining. The leveling up rewards are great. Not interrupted with ads. Not required to spend money (available if you want to). Only drawback is that your account doesn't work on multiple devices.",
            "This is the only Bingo app I play. You don't have to use real money if you can't afford to. The graphics are neat and there's lots of 'rooms' to play. One of my favorite things is how all the callers sound different. Some times there are one or two callers that have a thick accent, but it's easy to watch the 'boards foe which number is called."

            "Great overall! I'm working on eating more regularly and this app is what I'm using to transition away from fully logging every meal. Adding each item and seeing how many or what colors I'm lacking is fun and definitely inspires me to eat more and different plant based foods than I usually do (I struggle with purple, for example, so it's helped me try new ones in that category). I just wish various plant based milks (almond, coconut, etc) were listed, or that you could add your own food items.",
            "I've been using myfitnesspal to track nutrients, but ended up using it in a harmful way, focusing way more on calories than on quality of food. So I switched to this, and I love it so far, really helpful for creating a healthier mindset towards healthy foods and what they can provide. Thank you fue this!",
            "A little slow to get started, but smoother once you have a few 'favorites' logged. Fun way to get kids excited about trying new fruits and veggies. Great tool for adults, too!",
            "Really good app. It's a bit slow and clunky to add foods though. It would be lovely to see some features like being able to quickly add common foods, or see recent foods first in the search, or to multi-add foods. Edit: The update is amazing! The new feature is super handy! Thank you for considering my idea 🤩",
            "I love it! It has really encouraged me to eat a larger variety of fruits/vegetables because it's so fun to try and get the rainbow...lol....surprisingly 😁."

        "description": "Cards. They’ve been around for literally centuries. They have long-lasting appeal.\r\n\r\nSolitaire. Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire. If boredom was as life-threatening as children proclaim, solitaire would have saved tens, possibly hundreds, of millions of lives. No joke. \r\n\r\nTriPeaks. Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all. \r\n\r\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game. \r\n\r\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\r\n\r\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. \r\n\r\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. \r\n\r\nThere you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy:\r\nhttp://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.<br><br>Oh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma. <br><br>Also, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean. <br><br>There you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.<br><br>Privacy Policy:<br>http://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

            "Don't waste your time. It will be fun in the beginning but will get frustrating as you advance. It becomes extremely difficult to win. I have played the same level over 15 times to win and its impossible. I've went from having 90,000 coins to less than 3000 just trying to solve the same level (each game cost 3000 coins to play). I usually don't post comments, but this app made me do it.",
            "I love this game but why so much for each level? Also, 6000 coins for 5 cards?! Half the time those cards do not have the cards you need so you spent 6000 coins for nothing. I love this game but I'm finding myself spending an obscene amount of money just to pass levels I've been stuck on for days! It seems like the higher the level the less cards they give you. The boosts cost 6000 coins each which is ridiculous. No more will I spend my money on this game which is clearly what they want.",
            "2nd review. Again, it's a beautiful game but the decks aren't legitimate and I know in my gut that the cards are changing to make you keep spending your bank and each hand costs more and more, it takes the fun away from the game. It's not honest. I just won 5000 coins and I didn't get them. I watched that corner and it never changed. Shame.",
            "Love this game . But for some reason it's having problems loading my progress this morning. I have restarted my phone. I have restarted the game several times and it's still stuck in the mode of loading my progress. I have almost 190,000 coins that I hate to lose if I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. My Wi-Fi is up and running well so that is not the issue. You have told players to go to menu and then ask for help. If you can't get into the game you can't go to menu and ask for help.",
            "I downloaded this game as a reward offer was promised after completing level 65. I am currently on level 70 and they refuse to grant the reward of diamonds in the game app that it advertised and offered reward in. Beware...if you are looking to install this game for a promised reward for reaching a certain level then know they do not honor that promise!"

            "Its fun but not honest. There's an option where you spin to play. You can put in like $100,000 with the chance of winning $1 billion but that never happens. I played 20 rounds last night on this option and the only thing I got was double what I put in. And if that was the only option that would be ok but the way they advertise it is just a joke. You can also get free spins and you get the bare minimum on any of these also.",
            "The game has become that bogged down with a dire amount of pop ups at startup to encourage you to spend obscene amounts of money in game that it rarely starts up without a hitch or crashing.... Don't believe the scripted response they post about their RNG, it's rigged plain and simple weighted towards those that spend or to get you to spend, far from random as the majority will lay testament to if you read the honest reviews on here...",
            "Awful. Pointlessly cheating algorithm. No point in playing as you will lose. Plenty of far better poker apps that don't manipulate the game. And to pre-empt the standard cut and paste reply from the developers : the hands dealt in the first few rounds certainly were fixed - and blatantly so.",
            "High level players playing on beginner tables going all-in on every hand before the flop! It's not very enjoyable. Edit: response to developers response; the problem is the high level player's that are joining the beginner levels (where I am) that make it impossible for beginners to enjoy themselves because the sharks are constantly going all in, so the beginners can't even learn the game or build up their bank. A level 160 shouldn't be at the same table as a level 12 (unless they are friends).",
            "This app is horrible it always kicks me out of the app and usually when I'm in the middle of a game and get a winning hand. Sometimes it won't let me bet and folds for me and the players with the higher level always win majority of the time. ***every since i wrote this review now it won't even let me join a table it just kicks me out of the app completely. This game sucks"

            "Great app! Was super impressed when I reached out and had several emails back and forth. This app was perfect for me because it took all the mental work out of getting healthy. Deciding on a workout routine was intimidating. Eating healthy even more so. Even if I wasn't pairing with a workout, deciding what to eat has always been difficult for me and often resulted in a lot of food waste. Not anymore! I am learning how to cook so much and my diet is tastier than ever actually!",
            "Awesome. This app has everything I need. I can track my weight, meal plan, schedule workouts...and it has stats galore. There is lots of flexibility in the setup, so I can schedule a cheat day each week into my plan. There are plenty of recipes to use, and if you go off-plan you can add things manually. There are loads of features. It's exactly what I was looking for.",
            "App is pretty good, has a lot of features and if you're willing to pay it offers a lot more. I highly recommend his, but 2 stars for the following reasons: the weight doesn't increase weekly by default (at least on the PHAT routine), and it doesn't have T bar or Hex bar as options when substituting for others. Add t bar and hex bar and I'll increase my rating Edit: dev responded and made clarity to all my issues. Highly recommend it",
            "Great structure! I love how much I can customize! There are a variety of options for popular workout routines. Within that I can select my rest days, and choose from a huge database of movements based on my equipment available. By following the routine it is helpful in selection of weight and keeping me on task with appropriate rest time between sets. I want to explore the nutrition/meal component more. It is so cool to have everything in one place. Thank you!",
            "This has been exactly what I've been looking for. The ability to pick from a variety of workout plans, set different goals, meal planner, and the grocery list all in one has been easy to use and makes everything easier and faster for me. A couple things: the food search gets glitchy and there's a delay, and maybe the addition of vegan or no-dairy diet restrictions. Also, am I able to update the days I can work out and the length of time, mid week/routine? Love this app!"

Now, whenever you open the folders list, you're at the beginning of the list and the first folder. So each time you have to repeatedly scroll to the proper folder.

It is so satisfying that it makes me feel like I am actually touching slime. All the other mini-games are great too. There are so many ingredients to choose from. But it does take long to collect them. And I do not care about ads. People who complain about ads are impatient. I am yet to try Squishy Magic. Please add a thermochromic slime that changes color when touched.",
            "This game is surprisingly awesome. Especially for those of you who are a fan of slime. I am a big fan of slime and I also enjoy making them so I love making, naming and choosing slime in this game even if you do it virtually. Just one thing, though, I noticed that one of the amazing prizes is very hard to get. Which is the thing I always hope most for. You will find out after playing this game. So what are you waiting for? Install this, right now!",
            "This game is great! It teaches you the ingredients to how to make different slimes, and you get to actually play with the slime you made inside the game when you finish it! You have decorations and colors you can add to your slimes, and its easy to get slime types, colors, and decorations! This is super satysfying ASMR. Would i recommend this game? YES, DEFINETLY, ABSOLUTLY",
            "I love it!! <3 Its super realistic and relaxing and it relieves my anxiety and stress everything is just so relaxing!!! I definitely recommend this to everyone its amazing and I love it you guys did a great job on this app its perfect! But one thing after playing with the game for a few minutes it gives you an ad but they're really easy to skip and there not that long :) ♡♡♡",
            "This game is the best!!! :) Its so satisfying and stress relieving and you can make lots of different slimes and you can watch ads for coins game is so fun and it is fun to collect all the Slime colors decorations and slime I really like to collect the Slime colors because there are so many and all them are beautiful I already have half of them already i would love to have all of them and theres NO PROBLOMS :)))))"

            "This is the absolute best slots game, that I have ever played. The graphics, in the games are unique and the wins play better than all so far. I find myself playing for hours when I have the coins to do so. When you win a large jackpot it makes it harder to put down. Still playing for hour's on my favorite game. I recently deleted 4 other games, because they don't compare.",
            "Fun and addictive. But you run out of free coins really fast!!! It would be nice if they would offer more ways to earn them. Once you run out of free spins, which is REALLY fast, you have to buy coins to play!!! It sux!!! And if you're like me, you know that to win more you HAVE to do a MAX BET!!! That is where they get you!!! You use up all of your free spins this way!! THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY MORE SPINS!!! DONT GET SUCKED IN LIKE I DID!!! IT ISN'T WORTH IT!!!!",
            "Played for months, spent probably around $1,000 on packages...having fun. I understand it is a play-to-win game and so I had no problem making the occasional purchase - but recently their greed has just gotten to be too much. The way the game is programmed to purposely work against you to force more purchases has taken any fun or sense of the excitement out of the game. They aren't even coy about it; it's just blatant and irritating. I won't be spending another penny on any Playtika games.",
            "Here we go again with the app doing more cool features which causes loading issues that go on for months. Always the same advice to uninstall and reinstall which does nothing. It seems this always happens close to tournaments ending so you can't reach the grand prize. Also too many contests going on at the same time, so you are being forced to play. Just what are these \"cool features?\"",
            "Everything in this online casino is about trying to get you to spend money on air. Everytime you switch games you have to navigate through 6 ads begging for money. Enough is enough. One ad is ok two is tollerable but so many ads begging for money is insane. If I was to spend money at an online casino it would be one where I have a chance to win real money. Sorry ceasers but your online casino is well below par in my view."

            "It's a fun game, however I frequently get ripped off when I hit jackpots. It doesn't always give them even if you get them. Also, my boyfriend signed in as a guest and he gets an option to watch videos for coins. I signed in through Facebook and I don't have that option. He gets 17 million per video. Why is this not an option for me? I want to continue playing but if the payout doesn't get better I'll have no choice but to delete.",
            "This is a pretty good game I bought points a few times but usually I can win enough to stay playing as long as I'd like. I think that every app should have a real jackpot or sweepstake, something monterrey . It not something thats challenging, not rocket science. So I feel like its robbing my time. They certainly want to sell. Just give nothing back. Its a scam, really we are the idiots. LOL. Michelle Grace",
            "The best game out there. Just like every game I try, I was skeptical at 1st. They give you videos to watch where your coin awards increase as you level up. Those rewards become very genereous. I havent found any game that comes close. You have other rewards such as slot cards where you get coins for completing albums and use your duplicate slot cards for the wheel of stars which gives you more coins and daily dashes and more free rewards. Their slot games are fun and engaging. Give it a try.",
            "When I first started playing the game it was GREAT, you win some and you lose some. Now they have put a fix on the game to get you to spend more money because it jumps a lot from wins and it's like something was changed. I have played for hours and only won Big 2-3 times."

            "Easy to load. No ads. Works as advertised. Not a five -yet. If it's still going good a few months from now, I'll come back and upgrade my rating. Okay I've had this app for several months. It has been very dependable. I am upgrading my rating to a 5. It's been two and a half months since my last comment. The app continues to perform very very well. I have recommended it to friends, and I recommend it here. If you need a cell phone flashlight, this is probably the best one you can get.",
            "Have had this flashlight app for a while and love it! It does what it's supposed to do, without all the unnecessary extras, no annoying adds, and it doesn't glitch on me. Have had it for a year or 2 now, but have been using it every night since our fish unexpectedly had babies (we thought/we're told she was a male...surprise)! The babies are tiny and hard to see, honestly. But this flashlight makes it a lot easier! Great for walking to the bathroom when out camping, too!",
            "I've been looking for this app off and on for roughly 7 years, now. All the others I've tried have too many bells and whistles (flashing strobe lights), gimmicky color changes, or just plain weird variations of patterns (spiraling, hypnotic, etc.). All I wanted was a super-bright flashlight that was on-off at the touch of a button, and this app fills the bill perfectly. Even better, the app stays open for one-click OFF when I'm done.",
            "Update 10.10.20: Still just one ad, once in a while, to Rate 5, even if its already a 5, just one click back and i'm back to no ads on the screen & Best Light!... THANKS Developer! [ ... 1st day rated5] ... installing... I have been looking for years for a better light and mine is still Awesome... THIS FLASHLIGHT IS SO BRIGHT, YIKES! (btw Previous lights had pop-ups sending me onto Browser etc! NO POPUPS, so far... So Thanking Now! Simple! Sleeker! Brighter! Awesomest,SoFar...",
            "It's a simple app that does just what it needs to. The ads at the bottom aren't intrusive. My favorite feature is that I can use the flashlight while having a different app open and active without it automatically turning off the flashlight."

Hepatitis is a disease that affects the organ liver –that plays a vital role in keeping our body healthy by removing impurities from the food we eat. Everything you eat and drink passes through your liver.\r\n\r\nHepatitis is generally caused by virus and is classified into five different types: Hepatitis A Hepatitis B hepatitis C hepatitis D and hepatitis E. Hepatitis B, C and D occur primarily due to contact with infected bodily fluids. The primary causes of Hepatitis A and E are consumption of contaminated water and food. Other causes include eating raw oysters or raw shellfish or raw meat - which carry a higher risk of a Hepatitis A infection.\r\nNot all forms of hepatitis are infectious. Alcohol, medicines, and chemical may be bad for the liver and cause inflammation. A person may have a genetic problem, a metabolic disorder, or an immune related injury. Obesity can be a cause of liver damage which can lead to inflammation. These are known as non-infectious causes.\r\n\r\nEating a balance diet plays important role in treatment of hepatitis. The diet should include foods that are easy on the liver and exclude foods that cause the liver to work harder as this can delay a patient’s recovery from the disease.\r\n\r\nFruits and vegetables should be a significant part of any diet to help in recovering from a liver disease. They are full of essential nutrients and are easy to digest.

My resolution this year is to be healthier without being obsessive about food and I really resonate with the Healthy Luxe girls.Having the nutrition panels is helpful for me to get an idea of the macro/micronutrients of the food but I love that they give reminders that it is about much more than calories in vs calories out. Its taken me along time to grasp this concept but after readin gafew Healthy Luxe blog post",

            "Great games. Have. Change my rating. I was shortchanged my tokens on million machine several times. Whenever I would get to the top bracket it go back to the bottom tier. I sent several request for help but never got a feedback. It cost me a lot of tokens. Still enjoy the casino games but disappointed. Happy to report that I received extra tokens by the next morning. Thank you CSN support staff.",
            "Having a blast. Just need more tokens. Would like to see tokens for watching ads. Love your Bingo game. Just lost about 60,000 coins. 😧 Boy this app is absolutely loads of fun. Thanks. Still very much loving this ga me. is Keep up the good work. Just want to add that i didnt play this app for 3 days when i came back to it it was just as much fun or more than before. This app is my favorite of all the apps i have or have had. I love Wheel of Fortune and most of the others. Keep up the good work.",
            "I really enjoy playing my rockmore however loosing streaks last way too long. I get iscouraged and quit playing. Again, I love playing mt rockmore but ever since I started buying points, winning spins are very very few and far between. This is so unfair. I will never buy points again. It's really too bad because the game is really entertaining",
            "Mostly irs great. But had to unistall when challages do not work. Cant believe how much for daily challangeI am deleting app because I can not, while living on social security, afford to continually buy tokens to play. I will no longer support you and your money grabbing ways. It is rediculaus that I should pay almost $200.00 a month to play a stupid game.Odds are better if I dont play.. At least I have an extra $200+ in my checking account. It not just odd but the cost to spin in chalanges.",
            "0 star! I have NEVER got anything other than the minimum $20,000 in the ball drop feature. I think it's fixed!!! If anything the game payoffs are getting worse! Losing time after time is no fun at all!!! Still a zero star from me. Strategy means nothing when it comes to the ball drop challenge. It ALWAYS pays the minimum!!! Payoffs continue to get worse!!!"

            "Constant pop ups wanting you to purchase. You have to say no to 3 ads in a row before you can spin again. A few spins later...there they are again. Hit what they consider a \"big win\" which can be quite often and guess what??? AD!!! Wanting you to multiply your winning by paying $4.99. I played for maybe 5 minutes and had to say \"No\" to so many pop-ups that I am uninstalling and never playing this game again.",
            "LOVE this slot game! I play a lot of slots, but usually delete them because you don't win and barely get enough in the daily bonus to keep playing. This one however is perfect! Lots of fun slots with different exciting bonuses on every slot (which is a must have for me, I don't like basic slots) and you ACTUALLY win! I LOVE it! Easy 5 star rating (:",
            "Early still, but it has cool slots and at least if you lose your ass, you can watch ads to earn yourself back into the game pretty quickly. That's a huge plus for me. I absolutely hate slot games that give a crappy bankroll to start and drains it in no time just to try to sell coin packages. We'll designed and big game selection too. Keep up the good work!",
            "I haven't seen \"buy this\" pop ups THIS awful since the late 90s just before pop up blockers were made to stop the disgusting greedy bs. This developer needs to get a grip. I was getting PAID to play this and try it out and I'm doing it is THAT bad. They need to rethink their policy on that. For real. Someone on their team probably deserves to be fired for this not happy nostalgia, this needs to stop. 100% trash till then. Update: just bc there's an x doesn't make the avalanch of pop ups okay.",
            "This game was great after I paid a couple bucks for a purchase to make ads go away (been playing nearly 2 yrs). But now, the Level Race and the Winning Cards are super annoying and interfere with tournaments. I get that you want to give people other options to get more coins, but you should also give players the option to opt out of these things. I buy the coins on my own and being harassed by these constant pop-ups is a deterrent. Once my coins are exhausted I'll likely just delete the app."

            "The app itself was pretty good. I wish there was a trial period before you have to pay so you can at least see what products are available. I subscribed but they don't have an unsubscribe option, so for a couple months I had to pay for it until I figured out how to unsubscribe (you have to find the app on Google Play and go to \"manage subscriptions\"). At least the subscription is cheap though so if the app doesn't have what you want, you haven't lost much money.",
            "Weston A. Price was the real deal. Love it",
            "Paid for and downloaded this app over 6 months ago. Never got to use it as it gave a message stated my subscription expired. I reached out several-several times for help and no one ever got back to me. It feels like being scammed. I paid for a service I never received. Very disappointing. The app should be free until you work out the bugs and get it to a decent level of function.",
            "Did not appreciate the auto subscription renewal at all. Nor do I remember being asked to approve the  auto renewal.  It just stole 30 minutes of my time trying to figure out how to stop the auto renewal.  Also I did not notice one bit of improved functionality by paying the most I have ever paid for an Android app.  Nor do I approve of my name being included in this review.  I am being generous giving this  two stars.  I will also bet that I can not come back here and bump my review up if I later learn to like this app.   I find it unacceptable to have reviews that can not later be changed.  After paying $20 I also learned that almost nothing is sold local by farms. ANd if it is not sold by a local farm I sure can not afford to buy it. Mail order is totally out of the question, for me economically.    There is no easy way to find anything. The app is still confusing.  Don't get me wrong I love WAP but sure do not like this app at all. An instructional video would be a lot of help.",
            "I agree with others about the out of date information about the farms listed on the site/app. I paid $13 for a 6 month subscription and the best information they can give me is that a  local chain grocer sells Applegate products. Well duh! I have noticed that when I went shopping. This app is completely useless, it won't give you information you already know, and is NOT updated."

            "Honestly, I don't think I've played a mobile game anywhere near as good as this one. Not only is the game beautifully polished, from the art, to the gameplay to the sounds, but it's also completely free from all the things that ruin mobile gaming. There are no ads, and the in-app purchases are completely optional. The game is just as fun whether or not you shell out money. The fact that this game is free to play is honestly a miracle. Undoubtedly one of the best mobile games out there.",
            "I got Pokémon Cafe Mix on the Nintendo Switch when it first came out and I have absolutely loved it so far but I really wish I can transfer my data to the mobile version from the switch so I don't have to start all over again and have to do all the missions just to get the Pokémon that come in. Is there a way to actually transfer it to your phone?",
            "Firstly the art style is gorgeous and actually makes me appreciate some of the pokemon I never did before. Secondly there's so many different obstacles that make a lot of rounds feel unique. Overall, quite enjoyable. Once I get into it it's a bit hard to stop!",
            "Super cute! I was having doubts whether to install it or not, when I installed the game man, it was so worth it, nice artwork, very calm gameplay I could just tap all Pokémon while eating and disturb them lol... I just wish that I could design the cafe my own way thou and have a much more open experience in having to design and buy stuff (I don't know if such a feature exist I just started) all in all super cute, and satisfying gameplay thumbs up! :3",
            "Thus game is fabulous! Good for some time pass or whenever bored, there are many pokemons to work with in the cafe! Overall i love it, and i would strongly recommend this to parents also as this could be a nice game for your kids and who knows, you can engage as well! So download thus app and don't keep thos adorable pokemons waiting!!😊👍"

            "Great system, really handy for the whole family!!! It would make more sense though if you had to tap and hold the items to remove them from the list and just tap once to edit... So basically the other way around. Because the way it works now it happens to us quite often that we accidentally remove items from the list. But other than that, super happy with the app :)",
            "Okay so I've used it for the first time for shopping yesterday, and yeah random things did get added to my list. It was frustrating because it was items that we go through regularly and it made us doubt if we actually needed it or not. Also I wish the inspiration page was bigger. I wish there were 100s of recipes you could search for rather than there be the same 5 recipes on a list. Over all I love the idea of this app, but it needs some work. I'll keep using it for now.",
            "Great app and would normally give it five stars but recently the Wear OS app doesn't seem to be sending notifications? It's strange as I can get notifications from Bring! to my phone when the Wear OS app isn't installed but obviously can't view my list on my watch without the app. But when I install the Wear OS Bring! app on my watch the notifications no longer come through. Any ideas? Have made sure all relevant notification permissions are set up on both the Watch and Phone apps so I don't think the issue is there.",
            "Great app. We live far from town and sometimes one of us will head out to do the shopping. Anything I miss from our shopping list can be sent automatically from my wife's list and vice versa. This is how web based apps should all work.",
            "Amazing grocery/shopping list app.. why? 1) Share lists easily for others to add to 2) Google assistant integration for hands free operation 3) WearOS support 4) stores your loyalty cards in one place 5) clean and intuitive interface 6) responsive development team 7) always improving and incorporating user feedback."

            "I could say a lot of things about Facebook and its' very interesting ways of getting zucced, but we are talking about the app itself so here we go: I'm quite used to Facebook app being heavy and full of glitches. But since one of the latest updates, I'm not able to save pictures to my phone. I click 'Save to phone', but it does not save. This is the only app that has this issue.",
            "I Love it because I have found people that I haven't seen in decades. And you can really keep in touch your family and friends. Chat face to face. Especially with the Coivd 19 going. I just think Facebook is the best App. They have ever came out with. I don't think anything could ever top it. So I Just want to thank the Guy Who invented Facebook. Thank you So Very, Very, Very, Very Much. Sincerely Blanche Gilbert : Family, and Friends.",
            "I can't even log on, it. Keep saying my notifications needed to be on, well I never turned it off. I've complained about the issue but I guess they made their money, so the hell with people who have a issue, I got so many people into this game, now I can't do anything Thanks for nothing , I'd give you 1/2 star, because I liked the game",
            "The app works great unless you dare to say anything contrary to the liberal agenda. Expect a lot of censorship, revoking of advertising, and even blocking of your account if you express anything rightwing or moderate. Its a pity, because Facebook used to be a great place where all ideas could be shared and discussed. Now, you can only share and discuss PC ideas or face repercussions. Imagine such a structure when we discovered the earth was a sphere. Oh right. This is exactly what happened then.",
            "The app has been constantly logging me out after the last few updates; and I just noticed today that uploaded videos don't get treated the same way as photos when it comes to privacy settings. Why can't I select my own audience for videos without having to delete them or forever have them accessible to everyone on my friends list? Especially if I use the profile video option, I like choosing my privacy for each post on my own."

Contacting them is useless. The do not care. I figured out if i manually called the number and let it ring a couple of times, not answer this created a message in my inbox and i was able to text. It sucked till i figured this out. Now that i know the game i am happy. On another note. Only use this app with head phones",

We have children at home and if something were to happen. I couldn't even reach anyone but 911. This is not COOL.",
            "Had this app for a few months, had issues sending images and then was told to pay for my number or I would lose it. Chose to pay, and according to my Google account it was supposed to be a charge of $8.99, yet I was charged TWICE, one for $9.74 and another for $5.41. Total of $15.15. This is a scam.",
            "Worked absolutely amazing for a year. No issues. Then recently it stopped working. Wont let me log into my account. Keeps freezing. Clearing cache & data did nothing. Uninstall & reinstall did nothing. Lost everything. Support is slow to respond. Incredibly disappointed."

But I am still giving it 5 stars because of it's value as compared to its rivals. Overall great experience",
            "When you have so many contacts and groups it becomes a mess. You have to scroll down for long to get to a particular group or contact's chat. The search won't work, because it takes forever. You can't access all your starred messages from one place, you will have to go into the groups or contact chats individually before accessing them. The status access should have groups, one should be able to select a particular group of people to see updates, and not just selecting and unselecting always.",
            "Works great *edit... changing my 5 stars. I have 2 phones. A US phone and Honduran . Same issue with both phones. 90% of the time, I cannot add people. I add them to my contacts. But they don't show up on WhatsApp. I have checked every setting multiple times, asked everyone I know, google searched and searched the WhatsApp FAQ. Nothing worked. The only thing I haven't done is un/reinstall. I'm afraid I'll lose important data. The only way it works is if people contact me via WhatsApp first.",
            "Please: 1. Add the ability to edit messages after being sent. 2. after we delete a message, a box appears saying \"this message has been deleted\". so annoying and sometimes embarrassing. 3. When we delete a whole chat, we want there to be an option saying \"delete this chat for everyone\", and then there wouldn't be any trace of that chat at all, so that the person we talked to wouldn't knotw we sent them a message. 4. Add a personal cloud space 5. Add channels 6. Hide phone numbers from strangers",
            "Recently I've been facing this wierd problem, while seeing somebody's status, the pics come all in blur and literally not visible, I had a whatsapp call and I couldn't hang up, even after it was over, the notification bar showed that the call was still going on. The device I'm using is RealMe C2, dunno if other users have the same experience, but please try to fix this glitch. Overall it's an amazing app"

        "description": "Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal. \r\nThe most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus, bacteria, or parasite – a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures to confirm the exact cause are not required. \r\n==========================\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n==========================\r\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Diarrhea symptoms, Diarrhea Treatment, Diarrhea causes, Diarrhea diagnosis, Diarrhea Prognosis, Diarrhea Epidemiology and history. \r\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Diarrhea Disease apps - \r\n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \r\n-\tEasily Change the page.\r\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\r\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\r\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAll these features are available for free. \r\n\r\n==========================\r\nSAY HELLO\r\n==========================\r\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Of course nobody respond to you!",
            "I am giving it 5 stars as overall it seems like a fantastic Bingo game.. The ONE thing that I DISLIKE is not being able to add friends in the game. \"Someone sitting on a commode in the Sahara Desert could be in the fans group\". One never knows. I added friends from the fan page in another Bingo game and got hacked quite frequently. PLEASE address this. Otherwise thanks to the developers for a.great game!",
            "Would not recommend. This is a money game. You can NOT play more than a few games. The task you are ask to do are to the extreme. You can NOT progress in this game. They ask you for email to send bonuses. Which don't get. They say to like their Facebook to receive bonuses. They don't post you any. You might get two bingos a day. If you actually want to play for a bit. You have to save for over a week to do so. You are asked to add people. But you are limited to 5 gifts ever 6 hours. Rip Off!!",
            "I received 6 pop-ups in a row trying to get me to spend money on the game. 6!!! While I can understand needing money to support the game, this game is excessively bad with annoyances. Game is purposely built so you run out of chips to spend no matter the amount you bet. It's just a program that asks for your money with the facade of being a game.",
            "I really like the game ... But I am having trouble with inviting people onto the game ... It keeps sending me to some kinda mobile log in to Facebook and when I want to change password it sends it to a different fb account that I had forgotten about over ten years ago... Plus it is connected to my fb that I use now ... Could you please help"

            "This vpn was amazing for the first year I used it. It was truly a 5 star app due to its fast speeds, eazy connection, and security. In the last months or so... The vpn has been heavily reducing my wifi speeds. Like a tab in chrome will take 20 seconds to load. As soon as I turn it off...1 to 2 seconds max to load. Not sure if the company is reducing costs or what...but its not usable anymore because it really bogs down the wifi and will buffer through youtube videos or online movies.",
            "***ACTUALLY*** 4.5 STARS I don't often rate anything, unless it is astoundingly terrible, or amazingly superb. And this time it is the latter of the two. I paid the nominal couple of dollars for the premium version, and it has almost exceeded my expectations. I even had to get a replacement phone from at&t and couldn't get anything from my old destroyed device, but I re-downloaded app, and still got premium version. Only issue is several locations are permanently full even though I pay for them!",
            "I have a paid subscription. But when I downloaded it it doesn't recognize it. How do I resolve this? Stop using this for a few months and use something else because It doesn't recognize the subscription. I prefer a refund to be honest because this is much slower than other VPNs out there. Actually I want my money back I have spent too much time trying to get this stupid subscription to take away the useless ads. I'm not paying $35 for something that doesn't work. The developer not contacting me.",
            "it works well for me. though it gets disconnected easily, but well.. i don't really care since i use it for free, so yea i don't mind to have to reconnect it every time it got disconnected. oh and i hope you can lessen the ads though i don't really mind abt it bc as soon as i connected to the vpn, i immediately close the app and i can avoid the ads without problems.",
            "The best vpn it's totally working(but not on crunchyroll they're too smart they blocked because my ip is weird shhhh)5 star's ain't enough other vpn doesn't work but this one does 💯 Percent recommended(I really wish youd add a little more free countries but it's fine I only use ameria)The best I wouldn't care if you would add more ads just to keep this app running and working uhhh can't express how happy I am."

            "Last update was Jan 2019. I bring that up as no support for Android 10 or 11. Clearly developers abandon this game and didn't bother to take it out of Play Store. Putting that aside, ads will randomly start playing and will play every time you exit the game. Overall, lack of updates, too many ads, and poor graphics, I do not recommend this game.",
            "So much ads but meh the ads that i see if it looks like a fun game i get it that why i like ads and gave this a five star 🌟 its such a fun game i had it when i was a kid and i am just now geting it so its so much fun i love this game and games like this are fun so keep up the good work and dont Lise to the people that say your gane is bad there just jealous that you guys have a good game and that they cant make a super special game like this its the best game ever. Thx for the good game. By.",
            "I love it. I've no problem with this game more much better and no hassles without AD not anymore. Thanks God! Of course, I'm rating and gave them more than 5 stars, maybe, 9 out of 10. I absolutely love this game to making me 💯% calm and more much better relaxing while I'm stoned. 😵😵😵😜😂👌 Irishman41 😁👍🤑🤑🤑🙌🙌🙌",
            "This game is super fun, BUT the ads are ridiculous! I play lots of other free games and they don't have this many ads. More people would probably play if this changed.",
            "I love this game!!! Its super addictive!! The only thing i dont like is when it tells you to collect 3 gems but they dont give you any, same with when it says to collect 2 car prizes yet they dont drop any cars! Thats super annoying but my only complaint."
